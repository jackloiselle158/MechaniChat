The contact owns a 2010 Toyota Camry. The contact stated that while driving at an undisclosed speed, there was an abnormal sound while depressing the brake pedal, with the TPMS warning light illuminated. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic, where it was diagnosed that the brakes and parking brake had failed and needed to be replaced. The contact was also informed that all four tires needed to be replaced. The tires and the brakes were replaced, and the vehicle was repaired. The dealer was contacted and made aware of the failure. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 150,000.
The dashboard is melting, creating utterly shiny layer on top, making it almost impossible to drive ( due to glare and reflection in windshield) during even during normal daylight, let alone at night with incoming traffic headlights on.
ROARING NOISE, DRIVING HARD, DASH LIGHTS FLICKERING AND GOING OUT, CODE READING P27/16 FAULTY SHIFT SOLENOID VALVE SLT
THE DASHBOARD IS BREAKING DOWN AND HAS BECOME VERY STICKY. THIS CAUSES GLARE WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT THAT IS A SAFETY ISSUE. I CALLED TOYOTA ABOUT IT ON 9/14/209, BUT THEY SAID THEIR 'WARRANT ENHANCEMENT' EXPIRED ON 8/13/2019. TOYOTA SAID THAT THEY SENT A LETTER IN 2016, WHICH I NEVER RECEIVED. I HAD MY CAR SERVICED AT A TOYOTA DEAL (JACK TAYLOR TOYOTA, ALEXANDRIA VA), AND THEY NEVER NOTIFIED ME OF THE 'WARRANTY ENHANCEMENT.' THEY SAID THAT THEY ONLY HAD TO NOTIFY FOR RECALL SAFETY ISSUES. THEY SAID THAT THEY COULD REPLACE IT FOR @2,171.46 THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL, NOT JUST A 'WARRANTY ENHANCEMENT.' TOYOTA'S METHODS TO NOTIFY ARE INADEQUATE AND THIS PROBLEM IS ONGOING - ME AND MANY OTHERS WILL HAVE THIS SAFETY PROBLEM BEYOND TOYOTA'S WARRANT PERIOD. ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY DO SUCH A POOR JOB OF CUSTOMER NOTIFICATION. THIS CAUSES A LOT OF ROAD GLARE AT NIGHT AND WILL CAUSE ACCIDENTS AND DEATHS. TOYOTA IS OBVIOUSLY NOT DOING THE RIGHT THING ON THEIR OWN. I HOPE THE NTSB CAN PLEASE ADVANCE A RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE.

ALTHOUGH WE DID NOT NOTICE IT AT FIRST, AS THE SUMMER WORE ON THE DASH BECAME MORE OF A PROBLEM.  I WAS HEADED FROM NORTH CAROLINA TO OHIO FOR MY GRANDMOTHER'S FUNERAL WHEN I NOTICED THE PROBLEM WAS MORE THAN JUST A STICKY DASHBOARD.  WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT THE GLARE FROM THE DASHBOARD REFLECTS ON THE WINDOW CREATING A SIGNIFICANT HAZARD WHEN DRIVING.  NOT EXACTLY AN IDEAL TIME TO FIND OUT THE CAR YOU HAD RECENTLY PURCHASED WAS BARELY DRIVE-ABLE AT NIGHT!

FOR ABOUT A LITTLE OVER A YEAR NOW, THE DASHBOARD ON MY TOYOTA CAMRY HAS REACTED VERY ODDLY TO THE HEAT IT ENDURES. THE DASHBOARD LOOKS LIKE IT MELTS WHEN ITS HOT OUTSIDE THEN BECOMES VERY STICKY. IT LOOKS TERRIBLE. IF YOU TOUCH IT, IT FEELS LIKE GLUE. THE DASHBOARD GETS SO SLIMY THAT IF YOU ACTUALLY PUNCTURE IT WITH A FINGERNAIL, THE MATERIAL OF THE DASHBOARD GETS UNDER YOUR NAIL. I HAVE ONLY HAD MY VEHICLE FOR FOUR YEARS AND I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH TOYOTA.  *TR
THE DRIVERS SIDE SUN VISOR WILL NOT STAY IN ITS FOLDED, UP POSITION AGAINST THE ROOF OF THE CAR. IT WILL FALL DOWN IMPEDING MY VIEW OF THE ROAD AND TRAFFIC.

THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC SOMETIME IN 2012 FOR AN UNRELATED ISSUE WHEN THE CONTACT WAS ADVISED THAT THE STRUTS/SHOCKS WERE LEAKING OIL AND SHOULD BE REPLACED BY TOYOTA BEFORE WARRANTY EXPIRED. I WAS TOLD BY INDEPENDENCE MECHANIC THAT THE STRUTS OIL LEAKING PROBLEM IS VERY COMMON TO THE NEWER CAMRY (2010 MODEL) AND IT COULD BE A SAFETY ISSUE. I TOKE THE VEHICLE TO A TOYOTA DEALER TO SHOW THEM THE PROBLEM. AFTER THE DEALER INSPECTED THE STRUTS, THEY TOLD ME THAT IT IS "NORMAL OIL EVAPORATION" SO THE STRUTS WILL NOT BE COVERED BY WARRANTY. WHEN OIL IS LEAKED OUT OF A "O RING"  FROM STRUT CASING/HOUSING, IT IS A LEAK, AND IT IS NOT "NORMAL EVAPORATION". IS TOYOTA PLAYING GAME WORD GAME ("NORMAL EVAPORATION") TO AVOID WARRANTY COVER TO IT CUSTOMERS (BECAUSE TOO MANY 2010 CARS HAVING OIL LEAKING PROBLEM)? WOULD IT BE A SAFETY ISSUE LATER ON?  *TR

The contact owns a 2011 Toyota Camry. The contact stated while driving at an undisclosed speed, the dashboard cover melted and impaired the driver’s vision. The contact stated that the damaged dashboard caused a reflection on the windshield. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired by an independent mechanic or the dealer. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure and a case was filed. The contact was informed that the repair was not covered under warranty. The failure mileage was unknown.
The Camry is experiencing oil burning intake Manifold. On 14JUL22 at 163,286 miles the red light oil can drip light comes on and off in my dashboard. I take to Toyota of Freeman, they do the oil change and that is it. Then, at 168,786miles, within 4 months the red oil can drip light on my dashboard light comes on again. I go back to Toyota of Freeman the service rep. tells me that this problem will cost me between $3,500-$4,000. I went to another mechanic that is certified by Toyota and he said the problems is Piston Oil Ring needs to be replace. He called all the Toyota Parts looking for the Piston oil ring that is for the oil consumption. He stated nobody has it. In the meanwhile, every 1,000 to 3,000 miles my car runs, I have to check the oil stick not to burn all the way, because the engine will catch on fire. This is a very big safety issue that needs to be looked at. When I purchase Toyota, I went base on that this car will last up 250,000 like all of my Toyota cars had lasted in my past. I called Toyota HDQ and they is no recall for this issue but yes for Camry Hybrid  2007-2011 and a different engine. As i was doing my research in YouTube.com It seems there are more Camry with this same issue. This is a safety issue, if I ever forget to check my oil stick to see if I still have oil the car will get on fire. I believe Toyota has a manufacturing issue with the Piston Oil Ring not being available to repair the issue. This is high risk situation. They need to supply the part or fix the issue. This a liability issue.
The dashboard on my vehicle is sticky causing limited visibility when driving and is a distraction.  I did not receive a recall on this.

MY VEHICLE HAS BEEN USING EXCESSIVE OIL LAST 2 YEARS  IT HAS 78000 MILES  I TOOK IT TO MECHANIC AND WAS TOLD THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH TOYOTA ENGINES  I CONTACTED TOYOTA AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS A SERVICE BULLETIN ISSUED FOR CERTAIN YEARS BUT MINE WAS NOT. I EXPLAINED THAT MY 2.5L (2AR FE) ENGINE HAS THE SAME PROBLEM AS THOSE THAT WERE FLAGGED FOR REPAIRS  TOYOTA REFUSES TO ADDRESS MY PROBLEM AS IT IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY. I WAS TOLD THAT THE DEFECTIVE PISTON PROBLEM HAS BEEN RESOLVED  I AM ASKING FOR ANY HELP OR INFORMATION YOU MAY HAVE ON THIS ISSUE   THANK YOU
I WAS ACCELERATING TO 40 MPH, UNTIL I NOTICED THAT I WAS ABOUT TO EXCEED 40 MPH.  I REMOVED MY FOOT FROM THE GAS PEDAL AND THEN, BACK OF THE CAR STARTED TO LOSE TRACTION.  I STARTED TO APPLY VERY LIGHT PRESSURE TO THE BRAKES TO CORRECT THE DIRECTION OF THE CAR.    I LOOKED WHERE I WANTED TO GO AND MADE SMALL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE STEERING WHEEL, UNTIL THE CAR WOULD STOP DRIFTING FROM LANE TO LANE.  THE SMALL ADJUSTMENTS DID NOT HELP, AND I LOST COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE CAR.     THE CAR WENT TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD, THEN THE RIGHT, THEN BACK TO THE LEFT.  AS SOON AS THE CAR WENT BACK TO THE LEFT, IT HIT A DITCH COVERED WITH ROCKS THAT SWUNG THE CAR TO THE RIGHT.  I NOTICED THAT THE RPMS OF THE CAR WENT UP FROM 1,500 RPM TO (ABOUT) 6,000 RPM AND I WAS ALSO ABLE TO REGAIN SOME CONTROL OF THE CAR.  I WAS ABLE TO STEER SLIGHTLY, BUT NOT ENOUGH FOR ME TO STRAIGHTEN UP THE CAR.  AS THE CAR WAS ABOUT TO GO OFF THE ROAD, I WAS ABLE TO STEER IT INTO A TREE, RATHER THAN THE SMALL RAVINE IN FONT OF IT AND RISK MY LIFE.
KNOCKING NOISE WHILE DRIVING
MY DASHBOARD IS MELTING. THERE IS A WARRANTY EXTENSION FOR 2011 CAMRY'S, BUT TOYOTA SAY'S MY VIN IS NOT ON THE LIST FOR REPLACEMENT. THE CAR WAS STATIONARY AT THE CAR WASH.
MY DRIVER SIDE SUNVISOR WILL NOT STAY UP  THIS IS CAUSING ISSUES WITH BEING ABLE TO DRIVE SAFELY.
THE PASSENGER AND DRIVER SIDE SUN VISORS FAIL TO STOW PROPERLY AND HAVE DEPLOYED UNEXPECTEDLY WHILE OPERATING THE VEHICLE ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS TO THE POINT IT SEEMED SAFER TO REMOVE THE VISORS. THE ADVERSE AFFECT IS NOW BEING BLINDED BY THE SUN WHILE DRIVING.
MY DRIVERS SIDE VISOR STARTED HANGING DOWN AND EVENTUALLY HAD TO BE REMOVED DUE TO NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE OUT THE WINDSHIELD WITH IT IN MY WAY. I REACHED OUT TO TOYOTA AND WAS INFORMED THAT OTHER 2007-2011 CAMRYS HAD SAME ISSUE BUT MINE WASN'T INVOLVED IN THE 7 YEAR EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR SUN VISORS. I AM NOW DRIVING WITHOUT A VISOR WHICH IS NOT SAFE!
FIRST INCIDENT:  JUNE 15, 2016  HEADING TO THE EXPRESSWAY ON MY WAY OUT OF TOWN, THE STEERING WHEEL STARTED TO SHAKE AND THE CAR STARTED TO BOUNCE.

I PULLED INTO A TIRE SHOP, AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS THE STEEL BELT. AGAIN, I EXPLAINED TO THE GENTLEMAN THAT THIS WAS THE SECOND INCIDENT IN LESS THAN A YEAR OF PURCHASING THE CAR. HE ADVISED THAT THE TIRE WAS DEFECTIVE FROM THE MANUFACTURER, OR THE CAR SET WITHOUT MOVEMENT, PRIOR TO SELLING AND THE WEATHER BEAT THE TIRES. HE PLACED THE TIRE IN THE TRUNK OF THE CAR AND ADVISED ME TO CONTACT THE DEALERSHIP.  IN BOTH INCIDENTS:  TIRE HAD TO BE REPLACE BECAUSE OF THE BROKEN STEEL BELT INSIDE THE TIRE WALL.

I HAVE A TOYOTA CAMRY 2011 HYBRID MODEL, I HEAR A KNOCKING SOUND COMING FROM THE ROOF. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID IT IS THE PROBLEM WITH THE MOON ROOF. IT IS MOST PERSISTENT WHEN DRIVING ON THE UNEVEN STREET PAVEMENT. ACCORDING TO THE DEALER, THE HEADLINER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AND IT WILL COST ABOUT $600.

I WAS DRIVING WEST ON FLAMINGO JUST PAST THE 95 EXIT.  I WAS DRIVING IN THE CENTER LANE, WAITING FOR CLEARANCE TO GET INTO THE TURN LANE.  WHEN I REMOVED MY FOOT FROM THE BREAK, THE VEHICLE ACCELERATED ON ITS OWN.  I WAS ABLE TO SLAM ON THE BRAKE AND STOP IMMEDIATELY.     I HAD DEALER CHECK IT OUT -- PLUS A PREVIOUS INCIDENT ON SEPT 24, 2012 AS WELL AS ANOTHER ONE ON NOVEMBER 6, 2012.  TOYOTA DENIES THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM, BUT IT KEEPS HAPPENING.    *JS
STRONG, LOUD, PERSISTENT KNOCKING SOUND COMING FROM PASSENGER SIDE OF ROOF WHEN GOING OVER BUMPS OR UNEVEN PAVEMENT.  THIS NOISE IS THE FRAME POPPING FROM TWO PARTS OF THE FRAME COMING INTO CONTACT, FROM WHAT I WAS TOLD BY DEALER.   THIS WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER PREVIOUSLY AND THE TSB WAS FOUND AND WORK COMPLETED.  IT BEGAN MAKING THE NOISE AGAIN AFTER A FEW DAYS TO A WEEK AFTER THE SERVICE.  I HAVE SCHEDULED TO TAKE IT IN AGAIN, BUT HAVE HESITATED DUE TO THE CONDITION I RECEIVED MY CAR AFTER SERVICE LAST TIME.  THE LINER AND BODY COVERS DO NOT GO BACK ON RIGHT AND THE CAR DID NOT LOOK NEW ANY LONGER WHEN I RECEIVED IT BACK.  THE PROBLEM WAS SAID TO BE CAUSED BY WELDING SLAG ON THE FRAME RUBBING TOGETHER, AND BAD WELDS ON THE CAR'S BODY.  THIS IS NOT WHAT SOMEONE WANTS TO HEAR WHEN PURCHASING A NEW CAR.  *TR
ON 6/20/2013, I TOOK MY CAR IN FOR A ROUTINE OIL CHANGE AND TIRE ROTATION AT AAMCO.   THE SERVICE MANAGER CALLED ME IN TO LOOK AT MY TIRES.  HE SHOWED ME THE METAL SHOWING THROUGH MY TIRES, AND TOLD ME THERE WAS NO NEED FOR A TIRE ROTATION.  ALTHOUGH AAMCO DOES NOT SELL TIRES, HE RECOMMENDED THAT I TAKE MY CAR SOMEWHERE ELSE ASAP TO REPLACE THE TIRES BECAUSE THEY WERE IN SUCH BAD SHAPE.  ON 6/22/2013, I TOOK MY CAR TO GOODYEAR TO HAVE THE TIRES REPLACED.  THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS A BAD LEAK IN THE STRUTS WHICH CAUSED THE WEAR ON MY TIRES.  WITH APPROXIMATELY 45,000 MILES ON MY CAR, THE GUY FROM GOODYEAR SAID THAT MY TIRES SHOULD NOT HAVE WORN DOWN THAT BADLY.  HE RECOMMENDED THAT I CALL TOYOTA TO FIND OUT IF THEY HAD ANY RECALLS CONCERNING STRUTS WITH BAD LEAKS.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE LEAKAGE WOULD CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM UNTIL THEY WERE REPLACED, AND THAT IF NOT REPLACED, I COULD COUNT ON ABNORMAL WEAR ON MY BRAND NEW TIRES, AS WELL.  THEREFORE, I WILL BE CONTACTING TOYOTA SOON.  I SAW OTHER POSTS ON THIS SITE CONCERNING PROBLEMS WITH STRUTS.  SO, I DOUBT THEY WILL DO ANYTHING ABOUT MY ISSUE.  HOWEVER, THE GUY FROM GOODYEAR SAID IT LOOKED LIKE A MANUFACTURER PROBLEM AND I SHOULD AT LEAST TRY TO GET THEM TO REPAIR AT NO COST.   *TR

ACCIDENT DESCRIPTION: ON AUGUST 7, 2011, I GOT IN MY CAR TO BACK OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY. I STOPPED THE CAR APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET FROM A CLOSED GATE BY STEPPING ON THE BRAKE AND SHIFTED THE VEHICLE INTO PARK. WITH THE CAR STOPPED AND IN PARK, I OPENED MY DOOR AND EXITED THE VEHICLE, LEAVING THE DOOR OPEN. I WALKED 25 FEET FROM MY CAR TO THE GATE AND OPENED IT. WHEN I TURNED TO ATTEND TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GATE, I SAW THE CAR WAS OVERTAKING ME, GOING IN REVERSE. I WAS STRUCK BY THE DRIVER'S DOOR AND GOT TRAPPED UNDERNEATH. THE VEHICLE CONTINUED ACROSS THE STREET IN REVERSE.  *TR
I WAS RETURNING HOME FROM THE  MALL IN POTTSVILLE, PA. I DROVE DOWN THE ROADWAY NEXT TO THE MALL TO THE STOP SIGN. I WAS ABLE TO STOP THE CAR AT THAT TIME. I PROCEEDED TO TURN TO THE LEFT OUT THE DRIVEWAY OF THE MALL. THE DRIVEWAY OF THE MALL IS PRETTY LONG AND ON A STEEP HILL.  I ATTEMPTED TO APPLY MY BRAKES AT THE TOP OF THE HILL. THERE WAS PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE BUT NOTHING HAPPENED. THE CAR CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE FORWARD. I DIDN'T WANT TO CONTINUE DOWN THE STEEP HILL KNOWING THE BRAKES WEREN'T WORKING AND CRASH INTO THE VAN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL SO I DECIDED TO TURN TO THE RIGHT SHARPLY ON A DRIVE THAT CURVED AROUND TO A NEIGHBORING STORE NEXT TO THE MALL (GOING ALMOST BACK UPHILL AT THIS TIME). STILL NO BRAKES SO I DECIDED TO HIT THE CURB TO STOP THE VEHICLE AND PREVENT HITTING ANY OTHER VEHICLE.  WHAT IS EXTREMELY ODD IS THAT EVEN THOUGH MY FOOT WAS NOT ON THE ACCELERATOR AND WAS ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AND I TURNED SHARPLY AND GOING SLIGHTLY UPHILL THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE ACCELERATION OF THE CAR. I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO HIT THE CURB TO STOP THE CAR.  I PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE AND BACK OFF OF THE CURB. I PROCEEDED DOWN THE HILL AGAIN. STILL NO BRAKES. I COULD FEEL THE PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PEDAL BUT THE BRAKES JUST DIDN'T WORK. I HAD TO TURN THE CAR TO THE RIGHT AND HIT THE CURB AGAIN NEXT TO THE LANE I WAS IN.    SO WHEN THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC AND THE LIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL TURNED GREEN I PROCEEDED DOWN THE HILL AND TURNED RIGHT ONTO RT 61 S. I IMMEDIATELY TRIED THE BRAKE AGAIN AND NOTHING. SO IN ORDER TO STOP THE CAR I APPLIED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE. THIS OF COURSE CAUSED THE CAR TO SPIN BUT AT LEAST THE CAR STOPPED. I PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL AND THEN USED THE CLUTCH LESS SHIFTING TO CONTROL THE SPEED OF THE CAR AND RETURNED HOME.     TOYOTA HAS RETAINED AN INSPECTOR TO INSPECT THE CAR TODAY AT THE DEALERSHIP TODAY 2/27/12.  *TR

When I first purchased the car I unlocked the lever to adjust my steering wheel and from that moment further my car never drove the same. If I do not play with the lever for the tilt steering and move steering wheel up and down while driving my car does not drive normal. The tires either feel like they were laying down flat when making a turn either way to the left or the right and the car seemed to be at a different position than my steering wheel was. I changed my lower control arms, inner tire rods(Front), outer tire rods(front),This is all since January of 2022. I contacted the dealership immediately when I began noticing the problem and they told me nothing was wrong with the car and they couldn't not help me. Now when I am driving it sounds like a belt shifted on a tire but hasn't or something is rubbing. My steering wheel shakes when braking, and my steering wheel is really tight. If I put my traction control on off and drive it somewhat drives better but the rubbing sounds from the front still appears. If I play with the tilt lever and move steering wheel in and out or up and down I can feel the transmission almost like releasing from straining but never feels as if it is straining if that makes since. The lever for tilt steering is sometimes really loose like it is about to fall off but other times it is so tight that I am afraid it will snap if I lock it back. No one seems to understand what is the issue at the mechanic shops I brought it too. And I am so scared of driving it that I have parked it since august because I am afraid for my safety and my childrens safety. I have heard and read about other camrys this year model having similar issues. One time my abs light and traction lights came on during my drive and then went off moments later. If I dont play with the lever and tilt steering during a drive, the steering wheel while shake, car wobbles and sounds like mud tires are on it, and the car glides all over the road and turns make as if tires flat.
My Toyota Camry has been burning oil for over two years. Last year it began to get worse. I have been taking it to an auto repairs shop to tap off the oil to prevent the engine from failing. This week it burned 3 pints of oils. I have been using Lucas to slow down the oil combustion. I was advised by an automotive shop that Toyota has recalled some Camrys for oil consumption problems. Moreover, the mechanic advised that the engine could be default regardless of the year of the car. My car is in danger of shutting down on the road. It will end up with engine failure if the issue is not repaired. Toyota explained that some vehicles were recalled for oil consumption- but not mine.  This is not fair that my car has not been included. I am seeking justice and for Toyota to do the right thing. I did not do anything to cause this issue. I am the owner of a car that has a manufacture faulty defect that is threatening the life of my car and my safety as well as other drivers. I  await to hear back. Sharon Scott
The contact owns a 2012 Toyota Camry. The contact stated that while driving 25-35 MPH, the vehicle shuddered and loss motive power. The contact was able to restart the vehicle. There were no warning lights illuminated. The vehicle was taken to the local dealer where they were unable to determine the cause of the failure. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and referred the contact to a local dealer. The failure mileage was approximately 35,000. The VIN was not available.
2012 CAMTY SHAKES WHEN ACCELERATING AROUND 20-50 MPH.
20-40 MPH THE VEHICLE STARTED TO VIBRATE/ HESITATION/ACCELERATION VERY RISKY. WENT TO DEALERSHIP. UNFORTUNATELY NO HELP. SAD   VEHICLE IN MOTION
ON TWO OCCASIONS, WHILE DRIVING, THE ENGINE TURNED OFF FOR APPROXIMATELY 1 OR 2 MINUTES, LEADING TO A LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE, THE BRAKES AND THE STEERING. THEN IT AUTOMATICALLY TURNED BACK ON, AND I COULD CONTINUE DRIVING. ON BOTH OCCASIONS I WAS DRIVING AT APPROXIMATELY 20KMS PER HOUR, AND I WAS MAKING A TURN. ON THE 2ND OCCASION, THE CAR WENT UPONTO THE SIDEWALK AND CRASHED INTO A TALL STEP THAT PROECTED THE CAR FROM GOING THROUGH THE DISPLAY WINDOW.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE AGENCY IN CUERNAVACA, MEXICO AND THEY RAN A SCAN THAT INDICATED THAT THE ENGINE HAD IN FACT TURNED OFF WHILE GOING 19KMS PER HOUR, BUT THEY KEPT THE REPORT AND REFUSED TO TURN IT OVER TO ME. THIS IS THE ONLY 'PROOF' OR SUPPORTING INFORMATION THAT I WOULD HAVE HAD.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 TOYOTA CAMRY. WHILE THE CONTACT'S VEHICLE WAS APPROACHING A TRAFFIC LIGHT AND DEPRESSING THE BRAKE PEDAL, IT WAS REAR ENDED BY ANOTHER VEHICLE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE OTHER DRIVER INFORMED HIM THAT THE BRAKE LIGHTS WERE NOT ILLUMINATED. THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. THERE WERE NO WARNING INDICATORS ILLUMINATED. A POLICE REPORT WAS NOT FILED AND THERE WERE NO INJURIES. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO KEITH PIERSON TOYOTA (LOCATED AT 6501 YOUNGERMAN CIR, JACKSONVILLE, FL 32244, (904) 207-7065) WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH FAILED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 95,119.
I HAVE NOTICED THAT MY VEHICLE IS CONSUMING EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF OIL. THE ENGINE BURNS HALF A QUARTER OR MORE OF OIL IN BETWEEN THE OIL CHANGES. IT IS EXHIBITING ABNORMAL OIL CONSUMPTION. MY MOST RECENT OIL CHANGE WAS ON 03/02/19 AND MY VEHICLE IS ALREADY LOW ON MOTOR OIL. I HAVE ATTACHED A PHOTO OF WHERE IT IS TODAY 05/27/19.
WHEN DRIVING BETWEEN THE SPEEDS OF 35-60 MPH, CAN SHAKES AND SHUDDERS WHILE ACCELERATING. VERY NOTICEABLE WHEN COASTING AT THESE SPEEDS AND THEN STEPPING ON ACCELERATOR. CAR FEELS AND SOUNDS LIKE RIDING OVER RUMBLE STRIPS. THIS HAS BEEN OCCURRING FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS. CAR HAS 148,000 MILES ON IT.
OUR 2012 CAMRY SE HAD APPROXIMATELY 66,000 MILES WHEN THE BRAKE PROBLEM OCCURRED. I WAS THE DRIVING VEHICLE ON THE HIGHWAY ON 7/30/18 GOING 55 MPH WHEN I HEARD AN WHISTLING SOUND FOR 2-3 MINUTES. WHEN I ARRIVED AT MY DESTINATION 10 MILES FROM MY HOME I SMELT A BURNING SMELL WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM THE LEFT REAR WHEEL. WHEN I TOUCHED THE WHEEL IT WAS VERY HOT AND WOULD HAVE BURNED MY HAND IF I LEFT IT THERE.    I DROVE HOME LATER AND THE SAME THING OCCURRED. I THREW SOME WATER ON IT AND A CLOUD OF STEAM AROSE. I CALLED MY MECHANIC WHO SAID IT WAS MOST LIKELY A STUCK DISC BRAKE CALIBER AND THAT HE HAD SEEN THE PROBLEM BEFORE ON 2012 & 2013 CAMRYS.    THE MECHANIC DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A SEIZED CALIBER PISTON WHICH REQUIRED THE REPLACEMENT OF THE LEFT REAR CALIBER, PADS AND ROTOR FOR OVER $500.00. MY CONCERN IS THAT I HAVE NEVER HAD A SAFETY PROBLEM LIKE THIS OCCUR IN ANY VEHICLE NEVER MIND A FAIRLY NEW CAMRY WHICH PASSED A SAFETY INSPECTION AT TOYOTA AS PART OF AN OIL CHANGE ON 2/20/18 WHEN THE VEHICLE HAD 63,253 MILES. IN MY OPINION THERE IS A DEFECT IN THE DESIGN OR IN THE QUALITY OF THE BRAKE SYSTEM WHICH COULD LEAD TO A BRAKE SYSTEM FIRE OR BRAKE FAILURE.
I WAS JUST AT A STOPLIGHT.  I WAS THE FIRST CAR.  WHEN I WENT TO ACCELERATE THE CAR DID NOT PICK UP SPEED FOR AT LEAST A FULL MINUTE.  I WAS AFRAID SOMEONE DRIVING BEHIND ME WOULD RUN INTO MY CAR OR START HONKING BECAUSE I WAS DRIVING SO SLOW.  IT HAPPENED AT THE STOP LIGHT PRIOR TOO, BUT IT WASN'T AS NOTICEABLE BECAUSE I RAN INTO ANOTHER STOP LIGHT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.  I CALLED TOYOTA AND WAS ADVISED TO TAKE THE CAR TO A CERTIFIED TOYOTA DEALER AFTER I READ A REPORT ON CARS.COM THAT SAID THE PROBLEM MIGHT BE DUE TO A COMBINATION OF AN ENGINE CONTROL MODULE SOFTWARE GLITCH AND A FAULTY TORQUE CONVERTER.  I LATER READ THAT THE BRAKE PEDAL MAY NEED ADJUSTING BECAUSE THE GAS PEDAL THINKS THE BRAKE PEDAL IS ON.
DELAY IN SHIFTING ON LOW SPEEDS BETTWEEN 20 AND 50 MPH.THE CAR SHUTTTERS WHEN ACCELERATING OR COMING TO STOP
I AM HAVING PROBLEMS WITH MY DOOR LOCK ACTUATORS. I HAVE HAD THE FRONT TWO REPLACED. NOW THE TWO REAR DOORS ARE NOT WORKING APPROPRIATELY. WHEN I GO TO USE THE KEYLESS ENTRY THE LOCKS DO NOT RESPOND AT ALL. I HAVE TO UNLOCK THEM MANUALLY. I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT I SHOULD NOT BE HAVING WITH THIS CAR.
THE STEERING COLUMN ON MY 2012 CAMRY SE WILL NOT STAY IN POSITION. THE LEVER THAT IS SUPPOSED TO LOCK THE COLUMN INTO POSITION KEEPS FALLING OPEN, FROM GRAVITY, ALLOWING THE COLUMN TO TELESCOPE OUT, BE PUSHED IN, PULL UP, OR DOWN, WITH THE VERY LITTLE PRESSURE WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE. THE DEALER TELLS ME THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO REPAIR THIS, THAT THEY'LL HAVE TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE COLUMN FOR $1,400 SINCE MY CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY (OVER 36,000 MILES).  THE COLUMN BEING SO PLIANT, FALLING OUT OF POSITION MAKES DRIVING, ESPECIALLY TIGHT TURNING OR SUDDEN STOPS VERY DANGEROUS.  *TR
WHEN I AM DRIVING BETWEEN THE SPEEDS OF 35 TO 55 THERE IS A VIBRATION AS IF THE TRANSMISSION IS GRINDING, I TOOK IT TO THE CAR DEALER SHIP AND WAS TOLD THIS HAS BEEN A ISSUE WITH THIS YEAR MODEL AND THAT WE CAN EITHER CHANGE THE TRANSMISSION FLUID IN THREE SEPARATE VISITS OR ADD A VIBRATION STABILIZING ADDITIVE.  THE ADDITIVE WORKED FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS BUT IT SEEMS TO BE WORSE NOW THEN BEFORE. I BELIEVE IF TOYOTA KNOWS THERE IS A PROBLEM THEY SHOULD FIX IT AT NO COST TO THE CUSTOMER I STILL OWE 13,000.00 ON MY CAR AND DO NOT FEEL IT SHOULD BE MY RESPONSABILITY TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION. IT MAKES YOU FEEL AS IF IT IS GOING TO BREAK DOWN AT ANY MOMENT NOT SAFE FOR A WOMAN.
MY 2012 CAMRY HYBIRD WITH LEATHER SEATS. MY PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE RELATED TO THE WEIGHT OF THE PREVIOUS OCCUPANT, IE, IF OVER 200 LBS AND IT WILL PROBABLY WORK CORRECTLY. BUT IF THE EXITED OCCUPANT WAS LESS THAN 200 LBS, THE AIR BAG WILL ALARM AND MESSAGE FOR THE (FORMER OCCUPANT) PASSENGER TO USE THE SEAT BELT.    I'M TRYING TO GET TOYOTA TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM BUT THEY WARN ME THAT I MAY HAVE TO PAY TO CORRECT SOMETHING THAT NEVER OCCURED BEFORE THEIR RECALL.
CAR HAD EXTREMLY POOR QUALITY IN INTERIOR MATERIAL. REAR BUMPER, RIMS AND SEAT COMING APART FOR A LESS 40K MILES  SUPENSION FEEL UNSAFE WHEN UN DRIVE ON HIGHWAYS  VIBRATION ON THE VEHICULE  TOYOTA JUST SAID VEHICULE WAS DESIGN LIKE THAT.  ANY PROFESSIONAL REPORT ABOUT THAT CONDITION
WHEN PRESSING THE BRAKE AND THN PRESSING THE GAS SOON AFTER THE CAR HESITATES FOR A FEW SECONGS BEFORE PICKING UP SPEED.  WHEN PRESSING THE GAS AFTER A COMPLETE STOP THE RPM'S WILL GO UP BUT THE CAR IS BARELY MOVING, IT TAKES A FEW SECONDS BEFORE IT PICKS UP SPEED.  THIS IS DANGEROUS AS IT COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.  THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THIS, BUT IT STILL DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.
TL*THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 TOYOTA CAMRY. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING OUT OF GAS SERVICE STATION AT APPROXIMATELY 10 MPH, THE BRAKE SYSTEM FAILED TO ENGAGE CAUSING THE CONTACT TO CRASH INTO A FENCE.

RIGHT FROM DAY ONE IN 2012 WHEN I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE- IT RATTLES AND SHAKES. I CHANGED THE TIRES IN JULY 2014 AT 11000 MILES TO MICHELIN (ORIGINAL-WORTHLESS FIRESTONE TYRES).  AT 80 MPH ON HIGHWAY TOLL ROADS IT IS UNSTEADY AND CAN BE BLOWN AWAY BY A SLIGHT GUST OF WIND.  THE BODY IS WORTHLESS! THE BUMPERS CAME OFF. I HAD TO GET THEM FIXED.  THESE TOYOTA CARS ARE TOYS! NOT FIT FOR ROADS. I REGRET BUYING ONE.  *TR
THIS IS THE 2ND TIME I WENT TO STOP AND THE BRAKES WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR.   THE FIRST TIME WAS ABOUT 3 WEEKS OR SO AGO AND I WENT TO THE TOYOTA DEALER AND HE COULDN'T FIND THE PROBLEM. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE BRAKES ! AND I TRANSPORT A HANDICAPPED CHILD AND 3 MORE CHILDREN . *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS 2012 TOYOTA CAMRY.  THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHEN SHE ATTEMPTED TO START THE VEHICLE IT WOULD NOT START.

MY SON WAS DRIVING ABOUT 1/2 MILE AWAY FROM HOME WHILE TURNING THE BRAKE FAILED AND HE HIT THE CENTER CURB AND FURTHER TO AN ON COMING (STOPPED) VEHICLE. WHEN HE REALIZED THAT THE BRAKES ARE NOT WORKING HE PRESSED THE EMERGENCY BRAKES THAT SLOWED THE CAR. BUT THE DAMAGE HAD ALREADY OCCURRED. OUR TOYOTA IS 2012 AND HAS BEEN ROUTINELY MAINTAINED BY TOYOTA DEALERSHIPS. BRAKES SHOULD NOT FAIL. WE ARE GLAD THAT THERE WAS NO APPARENT INJURY BUT THE CAR IS LIKELY TO BE TOTALED. I REQUEST TOYOTA TO DO AN INVESTIGATION ON WHAT MIGHT HAVE CAUSED THE BRAKES TO FAIL.  *TR

YESTERDAY I WAS PULLING INTO MY SISTERS DRIVEWAY WHICH IS ON A DOWNSLOPE INCLINE AND MY CAR SEEMED TO ACCELERATE TO THE POINT THAT I HAS TO STOMP ON THE BRAKES VERY HARD TO STOP THE CAR. SHE HAS A CARPORT IN WHICH HER CAR WAS PARKED AND I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO CRASH INTO THE CARPORT AND HER CAR. IT WAS VERY FRIGHTENING AND IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TOMORROW TO TAKE THE CAR TO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP. IT HAPPENED SO FAST AND SO UNEXPECTED I'M NOT SURE WHAT REALLY HAPPENED, ONLY WHAT I FELT LIKE HAPPENED. I HEARD A SCRUBBING NOISE AS I WAS PUSHING ON THE BREAK PEDAL AND I THOUGHT MAYBE PUSHING ON THE BRAKE SO HARD HAD CAUSED THAT. THANK-YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION ON THIS MATTER.  *TR
DRIVING DAUGHTERS TO SCHOOL IN 2012 CAMRY V6 STOPPED AT A YIELD AND THE CAMRY ACCELERATED BEYOND 1500 RPM AND I HAD TO PRESS EXTREMELY HARD ON THE BRAKES TO KEEP THE CAMRY STOPPED.  CAMRY LUNGED FORWARD AT LEAST TWO FEET.  *TR
THE MASTER POWER WINDOW SWITCH STARTED SMOKING WHILE I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD ON 6/18/12. AT THE TIME, I WASN'T AWARE OF ANY ISSUES WITH THE POWER SWITCHES. SO MY FAMILY AND I JUMPED OUT THE CAR AND CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. THEY DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY AND THE CAR TOWED TO TOYOTA. THE POWER SWITCH HAD BURNED UP AND SOME OF THE DOOR PANEL WAS BURNED AS WELL. WENT BACK TO GET MY CAR, AND THE BATTERY WENT OUT AS WELL. TODAY, 10/12/12, MY CAR IS STILL IN THE SHOP AT TOYOTA. IT HAS BEEN A LONG, DRAWN OUT PROCESS, BUT I'LL BE GLAD WHEN I RECEIVE MY REIMBURSEMENT AND CAR. I AM A LOYAL TOYOTA CUSTOMER AND THIS IS MY FIRST INCIDENT WITH THEM. *TR
THIS IS A RENTAL VEHICLE PROVIDED BY LIA TOYOTA NORTHAMPTON, MA.  I HAD BEEN SHOPPING AND OPENED AND CLOSE THE TRUNK LID SEVERAL TIMES.  WHEN I RETURNED HOME I PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY WHICH HAS AN UPWARD SLANT TO IT.  I OPENED THE TRUNK LID AND REMOVED THREE BAGS OF GROCERIES FROM THE TRUNK BEFORE THE TRUNK LID CLOSED ON ITS OWN ACCORD STRIKING ME IN THE FACE JUST ABOVE MY NOSE WITH ENOUGH FORCE TO CAUSE FACIAL BLEEDING AND A PROLONGED HEADACHE.  A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN WHERE I WAS STANDING COULD HAVE RESULTED IN MY PASSING OUT OR MORE DAMAGE TO MY PERSON.  IT APPEARS THAT THE PNEUMATICS DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH STRENGTH TO HOLD UP THE TRUNK LID ON OTHER THAN A FLAT SURFACE.  A CHILD COULD LOSE FINGERS OR A LIMB IF THE TRUNK LID CLOSED IN THIS MANNER ON THEM.  *KB
Hi. My name is [XXX] . I owe a 2013 Toyota Camry SE and the selt belts in the back are not working. That is a major safety issue. I need it to be fixed. INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)

I HAVE A TOYOTA CAMERY 2013. I HAVE NO ACCIDENT AT ALL SINCE I BOUGHT THIS CAR. BUT ABOUT 1 YEAR AGO, MY AIRBAG LIGHT IS ON AUTOMATICALLY WITH ON REASON. I FELT MY LIFE IS IN DANGER BECAUSE IF THERE IS A COLLISION HAPPENS, MY AIRBAG WONT PUMP OUT.  I HAVE VISITED TO DIFFERENT CAR DEALOR. THEY SAID THE WIRE CIRCUIT MIGHT BE WRONG SINCE THEY TRIED TO SWITCH AIRBAG MODULES OR THE SENSOR NOTHING WORKS SO FAR. I ASSUME THE AIRBAG WHICH IS THE KEY COMPONENT FOR OUR DRIVERS' SAFETY SHOULD BE MORE ROBUST THAN WHAT I EXPERIENCED.
THE MOON ROOF GLASS OF TOYOTA CAMRY 2013 HYBRID EXPLODED (WITH A BOMB LIKE SOUND) AND WAS SHATTERED TO PIECES, WHEN DRIVING ON A 4-LANE HIGHWAY AT 60 MPH, ON A PARTLY CLOUDY DAY AT AROUND 4:00 PM.  NORMAL TRAFFIC WITH LIKE SIZED VEHICLES, NO OTHER VEHICLE IN THE ADJACENT LANES, NO LARGER VEHICLES IN THE PROXIMITY.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 TOYOTA CAMRY. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 20 MPH, THE VEHICLE SHUTTERED WITHOUT WARNING.

THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 138,000.
MY CAR SHUDDERS FROM 20-45 MILES AN HOUR HAVE TAKEN IN TO A CAR SHOP AND THEY SAY IT IS THE TORQUE CONVERTER, OR TRANSMISSION IN THIS CAR.  MY CAR IS ONLY 5 YEARS OLD AND SHOULD NOT BE HAVING THESE PROBLEMS. AFTER IT GETS UP TO 50 IT STARTS TO RUN SMOOTHLY.  THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION.  I SEE FROM COMPLAINTS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD THEIR TORQUE CONVERTERS REPLACED BY THE DEALERSHIP.
WHEN I SPEED UP 10 TO 20 MILES THERE IS A SLIGHT KICK AND THE CAR FEELS SHAKY. THE MILEAGE IS ONLY 66 K + MILES. IN THE CITY OR HIGHWAY WHEN SPEEDING UP THIS HAPPENS.
WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A STOP THE VEHICLE WILL SOMETIMES MOVE ABOUT 10 FEET AND THEN HESITATE FOR ABOUT 1 TO 2 SECONDS. IT WILL THEN ACCELERATE NORMALLY

MICE CRAWLING UP YOUR LEGS WHILE GOING FREEWAY SPEEDS ALMOST CAUSED ME TO CRASH WITH MY FAMILY TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THEM. TOYOTA NEEDS TO DEAL WITH THE MOUSE PROBLEMS IN THEIR CAMRY'S AND FIGURE OUT A WAY OF KEEPING THEM OUT. I KNOW LIVES WILL BE LOST BECAUSE OF THIS MANUFACTURING PROBLEM THAT COULD BE PREVENTED. THEY ARE NESTING AND DYING IN THE VENTILATION SYSTEM AND THAT IS VERY UNHEALTHY BREATHING MOUSE DROPPINGS AND ROTTING MICE.  *TR

I BOUGHT A 2013 TOYOTA CAMRY FROM GERMAIN TOYOTA, COLUMBUS OHIO LESS THAN 24 HOURS AGO ON 10/26/2013, THIS WAS A TOYOTA CERTIFIED USED CAR WITH 160 POINT INSPECTION AND 3 YEAR/36,000 AND 7 YEAR/100,000 POWERTRAIN WARRANTY, WAS HARDLY 6 MONTHS OLD WITH ONLY 8,274 MILES ON IT WHEN I TOOK POSSESSION. IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS BACK IN DAYTON SOME MAJOR PROBLEM APPEARED WHILE DRIVING, FIRST THE ENGINE STARTED MAKING SOME SMALL NOISE BUT NO WARNING INDICATOR CAME UP ON THE DASHBOARD, LATER ON AFTER ABOUT A MILE IT SUDDENLY AND COMPLETELY STOPPED WHILE I SLOWED DOWN FOR A RED TRAFFIC LIGHT. I TURNED OFF THE IGNITION AND RESTARTED THE CAR, THEN IT SUDDENLY STOPPED AGAIN WHILE GETTING ON THE I-75 HIGHWAY EXIT. THERE WERE CARS BEHIND ME AND CROSSING BY AND IT WAS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION CONSIDERING IT SUDDENLY AND COMPLETELY STOPPED WHILE DRIVING AS I SLOWED DOWN A LITTLE BIT. ALL THIS HAPPENED WITHOUT ANY WARNING INDICATOR ON THE DASHBOARD, AND CONSIDERING THIS IS A CURRENT YEAR 2013 CAMRY MODEL WITH TOYOTA CERTIFIED AND VERY LOW MILEAGE THIS IS EXTREMELY UNSATISFACTORY AND PUT ME AND MY WIFE AT DANGER. I'LL ALSO TRY TO CONTACT THE DEALER AND TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE SEPARATELY, I'M ALSO NOT SURE IF TOYOTA OR THE DEALER HAD ANY PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THE DEFECT OR WERE JUST CARELESS CONSIDERING THEY DID A 160 POINT INSPECTION AND SOLD THIS AS A TOYOTA CERTIFIED USED CAR.  CONSIDERING I BOUGHT THIS LESS THAN 24 HOURS AGO, I'LL TRY TO RETURN THIS TO THE DEALER AND IF THERE IS ANY HASSLE I WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE THIS FURTHER IN THE COURT. PLEASE CONTACT ME IF NHTSA WOULD LIKE TO TEST OR LOOK AT THE VEHICLE.  *TR

WHILE DRIVING UNDER 30 MPH THE STEERING PULLS HARD TO THE LEFT, DIFFICULT TO KEEP STRAIGHT AND IN THE LANE. STEERING FELT LIGHT AND SLOPPY, LIKE A LOW TIRE OR STEERING GEAR ISSUE, VERY DANGEROUS. FASTER SPEEDS NOT AS BAD.      TOWED TO DEALER, DIAGNOSED AS A "LOW VOLTAGE BATTERY". CAR STARTED AS USUAL WITH NO WARNING OF INDICATIONS OF A PROBLEM AND NO WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON.    THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A WARNING LIGHT BUT IT NEVER CAME ON. THE MANUAL SAYS IT MAY COME ON.    THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION WHEN THE STEERING ACTS UP WITHOUT ANY OTHER WARNINGS.    THIS IS PROBABLY A WIDE SPREAD PROBLEM AND NOT ISOLATED TO JUST MY CAR, ANY TOYOTA WITH ELECTRIC POWER STEERING.
MY CAR WAS DRIVING AND MY LIGHTS WENT CRAZY AND WHEELS LOCKED UP I CHANGED BATTERY CHANGED ALTERNATOR AND SOMETHING STILL DRAINING BATTERY AND IT'S THE ECU FOR MY POWER STEERING
THIS STARTED HAPPENING THIS WEEK. IF THE FRONT TIRES ARE POINTING TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT WHEN THE CAR IS FIRST STARTED, THE CAR WILL PULL HARD TO THAT SIDE WHEN I START DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD. I CAN TURN THE CAR, BUT THE STEERING SEEMS LESS RESPONSIVE THAN NORMAL. PULLING OVER WITH THE FRONT TIRES FACING STRAIGHT AHEAD, SHUTTING OFF THE CAR AND THEN RESTARTING THE CAR SEEMS TO RESET SOMETHING IN THE STEERING AND THE STEERING WILL WORK NORMALLY. THIS HAS HAPPENED NUMEROUS TIMES. THERE IS SOMETHING REALLY WRONG WITH THE STEERING ON THIS CAR. I CHECKED AND MY VIN IS NOT PART OF ANY RECALL. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE THE DEALERSHIP LOOK AT, BUT IT'S CLEAR FROM READING OTHER REPORTS ONLINE THAT THIS IS A COMMON AND UNSOLVED PROBLEM WITH THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE.

I WAS DRIVING HOME ON FRIDAY AUGUST 18TH AT ABOUT 35 MPH. ON A STRAIGHT ROADI SUDDENLY LOST MY STEERING. WHEN I GOT OUT TO LOOK AT IT THE RIGHT FROM WHEEL WAS TURNED 90 DEGREES TO THE RIGHT. WHEN LOOKING AT IT IT LOOKS LIKE THE RIGHT FRONT AXEL BROKE OR TIE RODS OR WHATEVER IS UNDER THERE. WHEN THE COLCHESTER POLICE CAME THEY DID NOT FILE AN ACCIDENT REPORT SINCE IT WAS THEIR BELIEF THAT SOMETHING ON THE CAR HAD BROKEN. THE OFFICER TOLD ME I WAS LUCKY TO ONLY BE GOING 35 AND NOT ON THE INTERSTATE DOING 65. WHEN THE WRECKER CAME HE SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS ON A CAMRY. I DID NOT HIT A POTHOLE OR CURB OR ANYTHING ELSE.   NOW TOYOTA (HERITAGE TOYOTA, SOUTH BURLINGTON VT. IS NOT CONVINCED THAT IT WAS A DEFECT. THEY ARE WAITING FOR THEIR REGIONAL OFFICE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION.    JUST TALKED TO HERITAGE TOYOTA AND THEY SAID IT WAS NOT A DEFECT. HOWEVER THEY DID NOT SAY WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT. THEY ARE ACTING LIKE THIS IS AN EVERY DAY OCCURRENCE.   I JUST WANT TO MAKE YOU AWARE OF THIS IN CASE ANYONE ELSE HAD THE SAME ISSUE.

THREE DAYS AFTER WE PURCHASED THE CAR, WE WERE BACKING OUT OF OUR DRIVEWAY, BRAKE TO STOP BEFORE PULLING INTO THE STREET AND THE CAR WOULDN'T STOP. WE HEARD A CLANKING NOISE AND IT TOOK EXTRAORDINARY PRESSURE ON THE BRAKES TO STOP THE CAR.   WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALER, WHO, AFTER INSPECTING THE CAR AND DRIVING IT FOR A DAY OR TWO COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG.  THIS HAPPENED A SECOND TIME APPROXIMATELY 2 WEEKS LATER UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS.  AT THAT TIME, THE DEALER'S SERVICE MANAGER SAW A NOTICE FROM THE CORPORATE OFFICE INDICATING THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM IN SOME 2015 CAMRY'S WHICH WERE MANUFACTURED DURING A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME.  THE PROBLEM INVOLVED THE "BRAKE BOOSTER" WHICH WAS REPLACED IN OUR CAR AFTER THE SECOND BRAKE FAILURE.  WITHIN ANOTHER WEEK, THE SAME THING HAPPENED TWICE AGAIN.  WE REFUSED TO TAKE THE CAR BACK AND TOYOTA BOUGHT BACK THE CAR AND REFUNDED THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE CAR.   *TR
Erratic steering issue related to weak car battery. I have a 2016 Toyota Camry XLE. The car began pulling to the left then to the right while driving down a straight and even road. The car would then resume normal steering for a minute or two, then the erratic steering behavior would resume for several minutes. In addition, the steering wheel would not return to center after making left or right turns.  This steering issue would begin 1 - 5 minutes from the start of a trip a continue throughout the journey. This issue has been reported by many other Camry owners in several online automotive related repair sites with each person describing these same steering issues. They stated that the problem was resolved when they replaced their car battery. I decided to replace my 4-year-old True Start battery with a new DieHard Platinum battery from Advance Auto Parts and had them install it a week ago. Since then, the steering issue has not returned, and I consider this issue resolved.
I hit a deer that caused all of the airbags to go off. A specific airbag under the steering wheel, a knee bag, caused severe bruising and soft tissue to my calf’s, crippling me for nearly a week. At one point I visited my doctor who confirmed the damage, did a test for roving blood clots, and sent me home to continue to recover. It’s been just over 5 months and I still have visible damage. I would have suffered no injuries if that ‘knee-curtain’ hadn’t been there or if it had not acted like a brick slamming into my legs. I’m concerned for others who may suffer similar unnecessary injuries because of this device.
AT ANY GIVEN TIME, WHILE DRIVING SLOW OR STOPPED, I WILL PUSH ON THE GAS PEDAL AND A 1 0R 2 SECOND LAPSE WILL OCCUR BEFORE MY CAR MOVES FORWARD. THIS HAS ALMOST CAUSED ME TO HIT MY ANOTHER CAR!!!!!!
WHEN I START TO DRIVE MY CAR THE STEERING EITHER GOES TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT AND DOES NOT STAY STRAIGHT.  IT IS HAPPENING PERIODICALLY.  I HAD IT CHECKED, HAD AN ALIGNMENT AND THEY COULD NOT COME UP WITH ANYTHING THAT WOULD CAUSE THIS.  ON THE HIGHWAY IT IS NOT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE BUT DRIVING ON THE STREET IT SEEMS AS IF SOMEONE IS GRABBING THE STEERING WHEEL AND PULLING IT TO EITHER SIDE.
MY CAR IS A 2016 TOYOTA CAMRY SE 4-CYLINDER AUTOMATIC WITH 67K MILES.  IT IS ON IT'S SECOND SET OF TIRES WHICH HAVE ABOUT 25K MILES ON THEM, AND HAVE BEEN ROTATED ONE OR TWO TIMES SINCE PURCHASED NEW.  KEY POINT: THERE HAS BEEN NO WORK (INCL. NO TIRE ROTATIONS) DONE TO THE CAR RECENTLY...    EVERYTHING WAS FINE UNTIL LAST WEEK WHEN I NOTICED A STRONG PULLING OF THE CAR TO THE LEFT.  THE NEXT TIME I DROVE THE CAR I NOTICED A STRONG PULL TO THE RIGHT, WHICH SEEMED VERY STRANGE SINCE IT WAS NOT THE LEFT AS BEFORE.  THIS PULLING TO ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER HAS HAPPENED A FEW TIMES OVER THE LAST WEEK NOW.  THROUGH EXPERIMENTATION I HAVE LEARNED THAT TURNING THE IGNITION OFF AND RESTARTING SEEMS TO CLEAR THE PROBLEM - IF THE FRONT WHEELS ARE POINTED STRAIGHT FORWARD.  I BELIEVE HAVING THE FRONT WHEELS POINTING STRAIGHT FORWARD WHEN I SHUT OFF / RESTART SEEMS TO CORRECT THE PULLING PROBLEM.  BUT IF THE WHEELS ARE POINTED LEFT OR RIGHT WHEN I RESTART THE CAR, THE CAR PULLS THAT DIRECTION WHEN RESTARTED.    I'M NO AUTOMOTIVE MECHANIC, BUT BASED ON WHAT I THINK I'VE LEARNED, THIS PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE AN ELECTRONIC ONE.  SEEING OTHERS INCIDENTS BEING ENTERED WITH THE SAME PROBLEM ON 2015 AND 2016 CAMRYS, PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS ASAP.
CAR WAS HIT BY TWO TRUCK ON BOTH SIDES. DRIVER SIDE THE DOOR WAS COMPLETELY DAMAGED AND THE PASSENGER SIDE WIND SHIELD, WINDOW AND FRAME COMPLETELY BROKEN. THE AIRBAG (CURTAIN AIRBAG) WHICH SHOULD BE DEPLOYING FOR SIDE IMPACT DID NOT DEPLOY. THIS COULD BE A POOR AIRBAG OR MAY BE DESIGN FAULT.
AT STOP SIGNS OR TRAFFIC LIGHTS, THE ENGINE WOULD REV CONSIDERABLY & THEN STOP. AS WE APPROACHED OUR DRIVEWAY, THE CAR LURCHED FORWARD, THEN STOPPED. WE GOT TO OUR GARAGE-ENTRY CONTROL BOX & THE CAR LURCHED FORWARD ON OUR PARKING DECK, GOING LESS THAN 5 MPH, & WE HIT A BRICK WALL. WE THEN PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE & IT LURCHED BACKWARDS SO WE STOPPED THE CAR, TURNED IT OFF & CALLED THE POLICE. MY HUSBAND, WHO WAS DRIVING, SUSTAINED CHEST INJURIES (BLACK & BLUE, INJURED STERNUM, MARK ON HIS COLLARBONE FROM THE SEAT BELT NOT RESTRAINING HIM SUFFICIENTLY, DIFFICULTY BREATHING/STANDING/DRESSING/WALKING - GENERAL PAIN & SUFFERING) WHICH WEREN'T VISIBLE TO THE EMTS AT THE TIME & HE DIDN'T NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL ALTHOUGH HIS REGULAR DOCTOR ADVISED HIM TO SEE ANOTHER AT AN EMERGENCY CARE CENTER. I REFUSED HIM MOVING IT ELSEWHERE AS I DIDN'T WANT TO DO FURTHER DAMAGE TO THE CAR OR ANOTHER VEHICLE WHILE WE WAITED FOR THE POLICE. I, AS THE PASSENGER, WAS NOT AFFECTED AT ALL PHYSICALLY. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO OUR DEALERSHIP'S SERVICE CENTER WHERE IT'S BEEN SITTING SINCE 3/21/17 AWAITING A TOYOTA INSPECTION ON APRIL 21ST - WHY IT SHOULD TAKE SO LONG IS INCONCEIVABLE AS IT'S OUR ONLY CAR!
I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE INTERSTATE AND MY SUNROOF EXPLODED FROM THE INSIDE OUT. NOTHING HIT THE CAR AT ALL TO CAUSE THIS.
when turning left right steering  makes a cracked noise.
Defect in the windshield- Lamintaed glass- Due internal stress in the inner glass layer, pieces of the glass started falling in my lap as I was driving. Please investigate. Called Toyota Customer Service Group and they failed to understand the safety of this issue. Laminated glass should not separate by having pieces of glass in driver's lap and reating a hole in the upper corner of the windshield

THE SIDEWALKS OF MY NEW TIRES (UNDER 10K MILES) SEEM TO HAVE WEAR ON THEM. IT'S AS IF THE TIRES DON'T HOLD UP DURING TURNS. IF MY GUESS IS CORRECT, THEN THESE TIRES ARE VERY UNSAFE. THEY ARE HANKOOK S1 VENTUS NOBLE. P215/55R17
WHEN DRIVING OVER MEDIUM SIZED BUMPS IN THE DRIVEWAY, OR GOING OVER RAILROAD TRACKS, THE FRAME OF THE CAR SOUNDS LIKE IT IS TWISTING AT WHICH POINT YOU CAN HERE A POPPING NOISE.  IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE IT IS COMING FROM THE SUSPENSION, BUT MORE SO FROM THE TOP OF THE C-POST (REAR ROOF). I DO NOT FEEL IT IS A HUGE ISSUE, BUT I FEEL LIKE THE BODY METAL IS BENDING EACH TIME.  I HAVE NOT BROUGHT THE ISSUE UP TO THE DEALERSHIP YET, BUT AFTER READING THROUGH SOME OF THE OTHER COMPLAINTS, IT DOESN'T SOUND TO ABNORMAL FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN TO THE CAMRY.
IN THE PROCESS OF BACKING THE CAR OUT OF THE GARAGE, WITH THE CAR IN REVERSE, APPLICATION OF THE BRAKES HAD NO AFFECT ON SLOWING THE CAR. AFTER ABOUT 69-80 FEET (ACROSS THE DRIVEWAY, MY LAWN AND MY NEIGHBOR'S LAWN) IT CRASHED INTO THE NEIGHBOR'S SHED. THERE WAS $6000 DAMAGE TO THE CAR , SOME BACK PAIN AND DESTRUCTION OF THE SHED.TWO MONTHS LATER, THE SAME INCIDENT OCCURRED BUT THE CAR WAS STOPPED BY PUTTING IT INTO FIRST NEUTRAL GEAR AND THEN PARK BEFORE ANY DAMAGE. THEN WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS PUT IN FORWARD GEAR, THE BRAKES WOULD NOT STOP THE CAR UNTIL IT WAS PUT IN FIRST, NEUTRAL AND THEN PARK.  ATTEMPTS BY THE DEALER TO REPRODUCE THIS CONDITION WAS UNSUCCESSFUL AND THEREFORE COULD NOT BE CORRECTED.
I have a purge valve issue when filling my tank my check engine light comes I smell gas and the engine jerks I have take. It for repair 3 times and they have replaced it but still the same issue occurs when I fill my tank.
Intermittently, when leaving from a stop the car will have just enough power to pull forward about a car length before losing all drive power.  The engine revs, but behaves as if it were in neutral.  This happened a couple times when making a left turn from a stop sign leaving the car in cross traffic, powerless, with cars coming from the drivers side for a second or two before it had power again. It seems to happen in hot weather.  It is intermittent. The dealership could not reproduce the problem.  There were no warning lamps.  I could make the vehicle available for inspection upon request.  The first appearance was last summer.  It did not do it over the winter.  It happened again yesterday.  When it happens it tends to happen for a few minutes before driving normally again.  It may happen at start up or after the car has been driven for some time.
The contact owns a 2018 Toyota Camry. The contact stated while driving at various speeds, the driver’s side air bag warning light illuminated. The contact stated that the warning light illuminated intermittently but had since remained illuminated consistently. The vehicle was taken to the dealer who confirmed that there was no recall on the VIN for the failure. The dealer determined that the driver’s side air bag system had a short circuit, causing the failure. The contact was informed that the air bag needed to be replaced. The vehicle had not been repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The manufacturer confirmed there was no recall on the VIN. The failure mileage was 130,000.
On 9/6/24 I pulled up to the gas pump and couldn’t stop. My brake light and warning light came on. I called Toyota and one of their service team members said it was covered because it was part of a repair kit that was completed on 9/2023. They then said that they did a recall repair at that time which involved the brake vacuum pump. I was not told this at the time. Now they say that this has failed and they refuse to fix it. I had no issues with my brakes until now.  I haven’t seen any recalls on this car and I feel that Toyota don’t want to stand by there work.They were only repairing two sensors and they changed my rear brakes.
Toyota told me my car isn’t part of NHTSA# 18V200000.. car has all the symptom.. losing power at driving speed.  ICS malfunction take to dealer check engine light on .. dealer states it’s water pump .. $1400.. how do you lose power from water pump ..?
The contact owns a 2018 Toyota Camry. The contact stated while driving 80 MPH, the vehicle independently decelerated to 20 MPH with several unknown warning lights illuminated. Additionally, the vehicle lost braking functionality with the brake pedal being depressed to the floorboard. Despite the failure, the contact was able to drive the vehicle to the residence, and later had the vehicle towed to a dealer. The dealer diagnosed the vehicle with a failed high-pressure fuel pump. The contact had previously received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 20V682000 (Fuel System, Gasoline) however, the dealer stated that the vehicle was not included in the recall. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 90,000.
Low brake power warning randomly comes and now the brakes are not working. Also having intermittent ics malfunction problems.
The car’s dashboard will light up and all systems started failing with no warning while driving. The car will not accelerate, brake, or steer properly. It happened twice and the Toyota mechanics couldn’t figure out what was happening and just tried changing something out on the engine. A few months later the same thing happened again (today). This is very dangerous as I have no control when it happens and I can’t control the car. In all instances, I was driving on a busy road, the entire dash lit up, I couldn’t accelerate despite pushing it all the way down with my foot, and I couldn’t steer the car. Luckily, I was able to get off the road before I was in an accident.
The brake vacuum pump failed while driving through the city. The part failed coming off a red light at an intersection. Lost braking power as soon as I drove off. On the notification screen, I received a "Low Braking Power" signal.
The contact owns a 2018 Toyota Camry. The contact stated while driving 35 MPH, the “Rear Crossing and Blind Spot Monitor Inoperable" message was displayed. The contact took the vehicle to the dealer where they confirmed the monitor failure and provided an estimate for the repair. The manufacturer was notified of the failure but offered no assistance. The vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 13,600. The VIN was not available.
The contact owns a 2018 Toyota Camry. The contact stated while driving 60 mph, the check brake pump warning light was illuminated and the brake pedal became difficult to depress. The contact stated he had to pump the brake pedal to slow the vehicle and maneuver to the side of the vehicle. The contact stated after parking safely he used the parking brake to keep the vehicle from rolling. The vehicle was not drivable. The contact towed the vehicle to the local dealer and was made aware of NHTSA Campaign Number: 21V890000 (Service Brakes, Hydraulic) however, the part to do the recall repair was not yet available. The vehicle was not repaired.  The contact stated that the manufacturer had exceeded a reasonable amount of time for the recall repair. The manufacturer was made aware of the issue. VIN tool confirms parts not available. The failure mileage was approximately 200,000.
Hi there, So I have an open recall for my car and the Toyota Service Center is not helping me to fix this issue, I went there two times for the recall and every time they said we don’t have the part yet, we don’t know when it gonna come, and every time they said we gonna call you when we got the part, which they never do, it’s been a month and I am facing issues while driving, brakes are not good, my car is not catching pickup, it looks like it gonna stop soon. So please help me to fix this recall. It’s been more than 2 weeks when I last visited to the Toyota Service Center.  Thank you and have a wonderful day!
The contact owned a 2018 Toyota Camry. The contact stated while driving 25 MPH, a warning light and message appeared on the instrument panel stating brakes services required. The contact continued to drive to his residence. The contact checked and then added brake fluid to the brake reservoir. Several days taken to the local dealer to be diagnosed. the contact was later the warning light and message returned. The vehicle was informed that the vacuum pump and power brake booster needed to be replaced. The vehicle was repaired. The vehicle was then traded because the contact no longer felt safe driving the vehicle. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 16,500. Consumer stated vehicle was on the recall list, both dealer and manufacturer refused to honor the repairs.
I am not sure why Toyota decided to set the front bumper quite low compared to other similar sized sedans from different brands out there. In the almost 4 years since I've owned this car I have had multiple scratches and scrapes on the underside of the front bumper; it's ridiculous. A very small dip in the road most of the time leads to scratches which I can feel while driving. The only way to not feel this scraping sound is to approach the dip extremely slow at around 5 mph, which is a safety concern because I don't want anyone ramming into my car from behind. Certain roads I need to pass when I get home have truly terrible construction to the point where I feel like I'm driving my car across a rocky road. I've driven other similar sedans and I don't even feel scraping along the bottom side of the front bumper when approaching a steep dip. I just can't believe how someone in the designs team at Toyota could possibly OK such a poor design. No scratches are visible on my car until you reach the front bumper which is a total disaster. In fact, much of the paint has been scraped off clean and you can see the graphite colored body color.
I was driving 75 mph on I-10 East going into Houston when I received a low braking power warning. My brakes were useless and I had to use the slow down gradually and slowly used the emergency brake.  There is a safety recall on the vaccum pump for this year and model but my car did not qualify for this.
3/2/2021 30 MINUTES AFTER HAVING MY WINDSHIELD REPLACED ON MY 2018 TOYOTA CAMRY - MY WINDSHIELD CAUGHT FIRE ABOVE THE REAR VIEW MIRRIOR INSIDE MY CAR -WHERE THE WINDSHIELD ATTACHES TO THE CAR  2 INCHES FROM MY RIGHT ARM , I HAD BALLS OF FIRE DROPPING DOWN -  I WAS DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY IN MORNING RUSH HOUR TRAFFICE MY INSURANCE PROVIDER HAS RETAINED THE SERVICE OF AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER
CAR KEEPS STALLING WHILE GETTING ON THE GAS AND SOMETIMES BETWEEN GEAR'S
ON 9/29/18, I LEASED A TOYOTA CAMRY HYBRID FROM SMITHTOWN TOYOTA. BEGINNING WITHIN THE FIRST FEW MONTH OF HAVING THE CAR, ON MULTIPLE, RANDOM OCCASIONS GASOLINE LEAKED OUT OF MY GAS TANK DOWN THE SIDE OF MY CAR. IT TENDS TO BE WHEN THE CAR HAS BEEN SITTING FOR A PERIOD OF TIME - AFTER WORK, WHEN IT HAD BEEN SITTING FOR >8 HOURS, WHEN I RETURNED HOME FROM A WEEK VACATION, AND OTHER TIMES WHEN IT HAD BEEN SITTING OVERNIGHT IN MY DRIVEWAY. I WOULD SMELL A POWERFUL ODOR OF GASOLINE WHEN I APPROACHED THE CAR, WHICH IS WHAT WOULD MAKE ME CHECK THE GAS TANK AREA. SEVERAL TIMES, I WITNESSED THE GASOLINE RUNNING DOWN THE SIDE OF MY CAR. IN ALL CASES THERE WERE GASOLINE STAINS ON THE PAVEMENT UNDER THE GAS TANK. AND THE SIDE OF MY WHITE CAR HAS A PERMANENT YELLOW STREAK DOWN THE SIDE FROM THE LEAKING GAS. I BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALERSHIP 3 TIMES TO HAVE THEM DIAGNOSE IT, BUT THEY SAID THERE IS NO WAY IT COULD BE HAPPENING WITHOUT THE WARNING LIGHT GOING ON ON THE DASHBOARD BECAUSE IT IS A CLOSED SYSTEM. THEY SAID I MUST BE OVERFILLING MY GAS TANK OR NOT TIGHTENING THE GAS CAP ENOUGH. I HAVE PICTURES OF THE GAS LEAKING OUT AFTER THE CAR SAT OVERNIGHT, AND I HAD ALREADY DRIVEN 120 MILES SINCE MY LAST FILL UP. EVEN AFTER I SHOWED THE PICTURES TO THE SERVICE MANAGER, HE STILL SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT IT WAS HAPPENING. FINALLY, I CALLED TOYOTA'S CORPORATE LINE AND REPORTED IT. THEY HAD ME GO TO ANOTHER TOYOTA SERVICE CENTER, WHERE THEY FOUND THAT THE GAS LINE WAS NOT CONNECTED PROPERLY, WHICH WAS CAUSING THE LEAK. BUT THEY SAID IT WAS FROM WEAR-AND-TEAR FROM FILLING THE GAS TANK, NOT A MANUFACTURER DEFECT (EVEN THOUGH THE CAR HAD <6000 MILES ON IT WHEN THE LEAK WAS DETECTED). THERE IS A RECALL FOR 2018 TOYOTA CAMRY HYBRIDS (J0G) FOR "FUEL DELIVERY PIPES THAT MAY NOT BE PROPERLY CONNECTED TO THE FUEL HOSES IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT". I THINK MY CAR IS AFFECTED BY THIS DESIGN FLAW.
I FIRST NOTICED SEVERE VIBRATION WHEN GOING ON HIGHWAY, I APPLIED BRAKE AND THE ENTIRE FRONT END STARTED TO VIBRATE. THE CAR ONLY HAS AROUND 16,000 MILES AND ITS 2018 MODEL. BAD ROTOR IS CAUSING THIS TO SHAKE. THIS ROTOR MUST HAVE COME FROM THE FACTORY DEFECTIVE.   THE DEALER IS UNWILLING TO REPLACE IT. THEY WANT ME TO PAY FOR THIS REPAIR AROUND $300. I REALIZE THAT BRAKE PADS ARE NOT COVERED BUT THE ROTORS SHOULD BE COVERED BECAUSE THEY CAME LIKE THAT FROM THE FACTORY.
MY WIFE'S 2018 CAMRY ROLLED AWAY DOWN OUR DRIVEWAY WHILE THE SHIFTER WAS IN PARK. IT'S GOT 33K MILES ON IT. ON THE WAY DOWN THE HILL, IT CLEARLY ENGAGED THE PARKING PIN BECAUSE IT DRUG THE FRONT WHEELS 10 OR SO FEET BEFORE HITTING MY NEIGHBORS HOUSE. THE CAR WAS RUNNING, I HOPPED OUT AFTER PUTTING IT IN PARK AND ALL FOUR DOORS UNLOCKED. I PUT A PACKAGE IN THE REAR DRIVER SIDE, WENT TO OPEN THE TRUNK, MY WIFE (WHO WAS SITTING IN THE PASSENGERS SEAT) HIT THE REMOTE ON THE KEYS IN THE IGNITION, AND THE CAR ROLLED BACKWARDS AND NEARLY HIT ME. ALL FOUR DOORS RELOCKED, THE PAWL CLICKED UNTIL IT ENGAGED AS IT ROLLED AWAY. IT JUMPED THE STREET, AND PARK ENGAGED AND IT SLID THE LAST 15 OR SO FEET.  THE CAR WAS STILL RUNNING UNTIL MY WIFE REMOVED THE KEY. THE SHIFTER ASSEMBLY WAS IN PARK THE ENTIRE TIME.
TODAY I NOTICED DURING MY CAR PARKED AT START UP THERE WAS A TICKING SOUND TOWARDS THE FRONT END OF THE ENGINE. AFTER MAYBE ABOUT A MIN OR TWO IT QUIETED DOWN A LIL BUT IT IS STILL NOTICEABLE WHEN YOUR STANDING IN FRONT OF CAR. I CAN'T SEEM TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE FUEL PUMP OR IF THE TRANSMISSION IS SLIPPING AS TO MY PREVIOUS COMMENT ON ACCELERATION DELAY FROM A STOP.
I WAS DRIVING ON FREEWAY GOING ABOUT 60 MILES AND IT WAS RAINING MEDIUM, MY WIPERS COULD NOT CLEAR THE VIEW FAST ENOUGH AND I WAS DRIVING BLINDLY FOR MILES. THE FAST WIPER SETTING WAS NOT FAST ENOUGH TO CLEAR MY VIEW.
WE MET WITH A CAR ACCIDENT ON 11/11/2019 MORNING. OUR CAR GOT BADLY HIT ON THE FRONT SIDE AND HAS BEEN DECLARED TOTALED BY INSURANCE. VIN [XXX]. THIS IS A TOYOTA CAMRY 2018. THE MAIN REASON WE WENT WITH THIS CAR IS THE SAFETY THAT WAS ADVERTISED. HOWEVER, DURING THIS CRASH NONE OF THE AIR BAG DEPLOYED FROM THE CAR AND HELPED MY WIFE (THE DRIVER) FROM GETTING THE SHOCK. SHE ALSO GOT NECK STRAIN DURING THIS INCIDENT. IF THIS DUE TO THE FAULTY AIR BAG, IT MAKES ME ANNOYED AS MY 8 YEAR SON WAS ALSO ON THE CAR WHEN THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED.  IT MAKES ME WONDER WHETHER THIS CAR IS REALLY THAT SAFE AS IT IS GETTING ADVERTISED AND REQUIRE YOU HELP IN REGISTERING THIS COMPLAINT WITH TOYOTA TO SEE WHAT WOULD BE NEXT STEPS.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR
WHILE PULLING INTO PARKING SPOT, APPLIED BRAKES & CAR EXCELLERATED, WOULD NOT STOP. ALMOST WENT INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC. CAR ONLY STOPPED WHEN I PUT IT IN PARK.  SCHAUMBURG TOYOTA CUSTOMER CARE IS LOOKING INTO MATTER.
THE CAR APPLIED THE BRAKES VERY HARD WHILE TRAVELING DOWN A MAJOR THOROUGHFARE WITH NO OBJECTS OR OTHER VEHICLES NEARBY. I WAS RUNNING AROUND 50MPH AND THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE ACTIVATED AND THE CAR SLOWED TO NEARLY 20MPH.
LAG AND HESITATION WHEN GOING TO FULL THROTTLE ON THE GAS PEDAL. IT HESITATES FOR A SECOND AND THEN FINALLY GRABS ON TO ACCELERATE. IT HAS DONE THIS SINCE I PURCHASED IT BUT WAS HOPING IT WOULD WORK ITSELF OUT EVENTUALLY, BUT THIS HASN'T HAPPENED. TOYOTA DID A TSB SOFTWARE UPDATE FOR THE 4 CYLINDER BUT NOT THE V6.
CAR IS OFTEN JUMPY AFTER ACCELERATING FROM A COMPLETE STOP OR ACCELERATING AFTER SLOWING DOWN. I WILL PUSH THE GAS PEDAL DOWN, AND THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT DELAY BEFORE THE CAR SELECTS THE PROPER GEAR, OFTEN RESULTING IN THE CAR LURCHING FORWARD. THIS ONLY HAPPENS IN TOWN, NOT ON THE HIGHWAY, AND SEEMS TO HAPPEN MORE OFTEN AFTER TURNING. AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN ALL THE TIME, BUT ENOUGH FOR ME TO TAKE NOTICE AFTER HAVING THE CAR FOR A MONTH.
TAKATA RECALL.  I AM HAVING ISSUES WITH THE TRANSMISSION.  SINCE THE DAY FIRST DAY I NOTICED THAT THE TRANSMISSION JERKS, CAN'T FIND IT'S GEAR AND STALLS.  I HAVE HAD SEVERAL NEAR ACCIDENTS DUE TO THE TRANSMISSION NOT RESPONDING THE WAY IT SHOULD.  ESPECIALLY DURING BUMPER/BUMPER TRAFFIC.  AT LOW SPEEDS THE TRANSMISSION CAN'T FIND IT'S GEAR. TENDS TO UPSHIFT AND WHEN YOU NEED TO ACCELERATE IT MIGHT TAKE A FEW SECONDS BEFORE IT GOES AND EVERYONE KNOWS THAT A FEW SECONDS IS AN ETERNITY (ESPECIALLY WHEN TRYING TO CHANGE LANES AND THERE IS A CAR COMING).
I HAD JUST EXITED A FREEWAY, AND WAS ENTERING THE SURFACE STREETS VIA A STOPLIGHT.  AFTER TURNING ONTO THE SURFACE STREET, THE SIGNAL AHEAD TURNED RED.  I ATTEMPTED TO APPLY THE BRAKES IN TRAFFIC WHILE TRAVELING AT OR LESS THAN 20 M.P.H., BUT THE BRAKES DID NOT RESPOND AS NORMAL.  I PUSHED THE BRAKE PEDAL DOWN AND THE VEHICLE DID NOT STOP AS NORMAL.  INSTEAD, THE PEDAL DEPRESSED FURTHER THAN NORMAL, AND I FELT A HEAVY VIBRATION FEEDBACK THROUGH THE PEDAL.  I WAS APPROXIMATELY 2-3 CAR LENGTHS FROM THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME, AND I PUMPED THE BRAKES AND DEPRESSED THE PEDAL AS FAR AS I COULD PHYSICALLY MANAGE.  AT THAT POINT, THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO SLOW, BUT SO GRADUALLY THAT I WAS CERTAIN TO COLLIDE WITH THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME.  I THEN STEERED TO THE RIGHT (I WAS IN THE RIGHTMOST LANE) TOWARD THE CURB OF THE SIDEWALK.  THE FRONT PASSENGER WHEEL WENT UP ON THE CURB AND THE VEHICLE STOPPED.  I PUT ON THE HAZARD SIGNAL, THEN WHEN TRAFFIC CLEARED BEHIND ME, PULLED INTO A GAS STATION APPROXIMATELY 40 FEET IN FRONT OF ME.  WHEN I STEERED BACK ONTO THE ROADWAY AFTER INITIALLY STOPPING, THE STEERING FELT VERY LOOSE, AND I FELT AS THOUGH I WAS DRIVING ON ICE OR WITHOUT CONTROL OVER THE STEERING.  ONCE IN THE GAS STATION PARKING LOT, I PUT THE CAR IN PARK, AND TURNED OFF THE ENGINE.    I EXAMINED THE PEDALS FOR BLOCKAGE AND LOOKED FOR FLUID LEAKS, BUT FOUND NOTHING.  I STARTED THE VEHICLE AND TESTED THE GAS AND BRAKES IN THE EMPTY PARKING AREA, AND EVERYTHING RESPONDED AS NORMAL.  HOWEVER, THE FRONT PASSENGER TIRE HAS A TEAR IN THE SIDEWALL AND THE RIM IS LIGHTLY DAMAGED.
THIS HAPPENED TO THE VEHICLE REPEATEDLY AND UNDER 1000 MILES ON THE ODOMETER.  UPON ACCELERATION THE CAR HESITATES AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS IF WILL FINALLY GO WITH A JERKING TO THE PASSENGERS.  IT ALSO HAS A PROBLEM ACCELERATING ON THE HIGHWAY, IT SEEMS TO LACK THE POWER TO PASS ANYONE WHEN IN TRAFFIC.  AT APPROXIMATELY 75 MILES PER HOUR THE CAR BEGAN TO SHAKE ALSO.  WHEN MOVING INTO DIFFERENT GEARS THE CAR WOULD ALSO FEEL AS IF IT WERE JERKING INTO GEARS.  SEEMS TO BE WORSE ON COLD STARTS BUT WAS DEFINITELY STILL A PROBLEM AFTER DRIVING AND HAVING TIME TO WARM UP.
WHEN THE CAR IN THE LOW SPEED AROUND 20 MILES/HOUR AND THE ENGINE AROUND 2000RPM, THE TRANSMISSION IS WIRED TRYING TO FIND SPECIFIED GEAR, MAKE THE CAR SPEED INCREASED AND DECREASED, IT LIKE JERK THE CAR.  ANOTHER PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU TRYING TO SPEED UP CATCH UP CARS SPEED FROM LOWER SPEED ON HIGHWAY, PRESS THE GAS PEDAL, THE CAR JUST LIKE THINKING THE LIFE PHILOSOPHY THE RPM REACH 4000 THE CAR SUDDENLY SPEED UP.
MY CAR REAR DRIVER SIDE TIRE GOT FLAT AND PASSENGER SIDE TIRE HAS BUBBLE. MY CAR HAS ONLY 2500MILES ON IT.
I had just gotten off work and turned on my car. I put my seatbelt on and that's when a message popped up on my dash saying "SRS Airbag System Malfunction. Visit Your Dealer". I was a bit concerned and worried and so when I started driving home, it still displayed that message and it started to beep as I drove more. It also makes it seem like my seat belt isn't buckled even when it was. I had gotten it checked out at a mechanic and they say it has to do with the driver seat belt buckle.
I started hearing a "noise" over the course of 2 weeks. When the accelerator was depressed, the vehicle never accelerated. The vehicle also seemed as though it was losing power, but no lights ever came on. I have only taken my vehicle to the dealership to be serviced. The maintenance has been done regularly and without fail. When I brought the car in for regular maintenance I had them check for the noise and they said they didn't find anything. I took a video before leaving for work the following day, and brought the car back. Because it sounded it was coming from the wheel well they charged me for a diagnostic and said one of the plates for my brakes was bent. The following day it was still making the same noise, but when I went to accelerate the car shut off in the middle of a major highway and then the check engine lights started flashing. I took it back to the dealership and they claimed it was an air flow component, said it would be repaired, and kept the car for 5 days. After the repair, it was still making the "noise" and that is when they said it was the transmission and I would be responsible for the repair. This happened at 150,098 miles. Needless to say, I will not be paying for that repair. I believe this is a Toyota issue and the customer, especially one who has been religious in maintenance and upkeep, should not have to bear the cost of a their design failure. I was also told although in the maintenance manual, Toyota has decided against flushing the transmission because it is sealed. No warning lights, messages, or anything of the sort ever appeared until the check engine light came on.
Drivers rear bumper just "fell off" bolts/ felt not staying in place. Resulted in bumper drag on ground and could have been a possible injury to fellow drivers. No warnings or messages appeard. A car beside me at the light pointed to me that the bumper just  fell off. Luckily there was a Ford Dealer around the corner who zip tied the bumper on for me until I got home. The gentleman said in his 25 years in body work he has never seen this happen. He stated multiple bolts were missing under neath and didnt appear to be holding the bumper/felt on. Reported to my sales lady and showed pictures. She was to have dealership contact me but no one did. Paid $997 to have it replaced but the felt doesnt appear to still stay bolted to the rear bumper. The vehichle was inspected prior to purchase but no one ever returned my concern from the Dealership.
It has a big bubble on the sidewall of the tire. I’ve had nothing but problems out of this namebrand tire they’re constantly leaking or getting bubbles. Tire size is 23545R 18
When driving my vehicle over 30 MPH my car would begin to slightly shake and upon taking my car to an auto repair shop he informed me that it was a transmission issue.  I then took the car to Apex Transmission and was told that the transmission had to be replaced. I assume if I did not get the car repaired then eventually it would break down.  I was given the choice of purchasing a used transmission or a new one from Toyota and I chose to replace it with a new one.  There were no warning lights or messages displayed on the dash.
There's a malfunction on Pre-Collison System and SRS Airbag System. Third-party licence softwares access to IoT sensors and vehicle data collection without the owner's informed consent.
My issue is with acceleration of the car from the start and sometimes driving at lower speeds. There's a significant lag when you step on the acceleration and then it just gets activated and car starts accelerating rapidly. It seems that the transmission can't keep up with the accelerator. Also there's a vibration coming from transmission between speeds of 40-50 mph, in general I want to say that it runs a bit rough.
UNKNOWN and my incident and cause for my 2019 toyota camry will goes as the same other people description issues with 2019 Toyota Camry
Car suddenly accelerated after putting the car in park mode. The acceleration stopped after I pumped the brakes. Now there is a warning light on the car.

2019 TOYOTA CAMRY. CONSUMER WRITES IN REGARDS TO FUEL PUMP SAFETY RECALL. *LD    THE CONSUMER STATED THERE WAS NO REMEDY FOR THE RECALL REPAIR. *JS
MY VEHICLE WILL STALL AND STOPS RANDOMLY. IT IS LOSING POWER AT STOP SIGNS AND STOP LIGHTS WHEN I HIT THE BRAKES. A FEW TIMES IT LOSE POWER TEMPORARY WHILE IN MOTION. IT KEEP SHOWING "CHARGING SYSTEM MALFUNCTION AND STOP IN A SAFE PLACE" MESSAGE WHEN THIS HAPPENS. IT WILL GO BACK TO NORMAL AFTER 5 MINUTES AND THEN THE WHOLE THING REPEATS A DAY OR TWO LATER. I TOOK IT TO TOYOTA DEALERSHIP TO FIX BUT THEY CONCLUDED THE CAR IS ALRIGHT SINCE THERE IS NO CHECK ENGINE. BUT THE PROBLEM IS THERE AND THE CAR KEEPS UNSAFE STOPPING. MY VEHICLE PROBLEM SEEMS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF JANUARY 13TH 2020 "FUEL PUMP MAY FAIL RECALL" NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER 20V012000.
VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION ON THE INTERSTATE AT 70 MPH.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND THE ENGINE BEGAN TO STALL.  I HAD TO PULL OVER ON SIDE THE ROAD TO PREVENT FROM GETTING HIT BY AN 18 WHEELER FROM THE REAR. I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE A WHILE LONGER BEFORE THE ENGINE STALLED AGAIN.  I HAD TO GET THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE NEAREST TOYOTA DEALERSHIP.  THEY REPORTED AN ISSUE WITH THE FUEL PUMP.  THE DEALERSHIP REPORTED HAVING MANY ISSUES WITH THE FUEL PUMP FOR THE 2019 CAMRY. ON THE DATE OF JUNE 29TH REPAIR APPOINTMENT, THEY REPORTED THEY FUEL PUMP IS ON BACK ORDER AND THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET THE PART UNTIL JULY 22ND, 2020 DUE TO SO MANY VEHICLES HAVING THAT DEFECT. HOWEVER, THE PART IS UNDER WARRANTY AND WOULD BE COVERED.  AS A RESULT, I HAD TO PRIVATELY RENT A VEHICLE WITHOUT BEING OFFERED A LOANER CAR OR A RENTAL FOR 2 WEEKS.  I HAD TO SPEND APPROXIMATELY 1,000 IN EXPENSES TO COVER THE COST OF NOT HAVING A VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO A DEALERSHIP IN A REMOTE AREA FAR FROM HOME AND WORK.  MY DISABLED MOTHER HAD TO BOOK A HOTEL TO CHECK THE VEHICLE STATUS THE FOLLOWING DAY WITH MY FATHER. I'VE HAD THE VEHICLE FOR 8 MONTHS WITH 29,000 MILES.   WHEN I PLACED MY VIN NUMBER IN THE SYSTEM, MY VEHICLE WASN'T IDENTIFIED OR QUALIFIED AS A RECALL IN THE SYSTEM DESPITE THE DEALERSHIP CONFIRMING THEIR WERE PROBLEMS WITH THE FUEL PUMP AND THE DESCRIPTION OF THE VEHICLE DEFECT MATCHING ONE OF THE 5 IDENTIFIED RECALLS  RELATED TO THE TOYOTA CAMRY.  BASED ON MY VIN #, MY VEHICLE DIDN'T QUALIFY FOR ANY RECALLS, WHEN I CALLED THE TOYOTA RECALL OFFICE, THEY REPORTED MY VEHICLE DIDN'T MEET RECALL STANDARDS .THE  KELLY BLUE BOOK REPORTED 5 DIFFERENT RECALLS AND THEIR DESCRIPTIONS IN RELATION TO THE 2019 CAMRY.  I NOTICED THE FUEL PUMP DEFECT/SYMPTOMS MATCHED  WITH MY VEHICLE OUT OF THE 5 IDENTIFIED RECALLS.
CAR DOES NOT FULLY WARM UP TO OPERATING TEMPERATURE WHEN WEATHER TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE IS UNDER 45 DEGREES. TEMPERATURE GAUGE WILL CONSTANTLY MOVE TOWARD COLD WHEN I AM IDLING OR STOPPED AT A STOP LIGHT AND I HAVE TO DRIVE AGGRESSIVELY FOR THE ENGINE TO GET TO OPERATING TEMPERATURE. HEAT BLOWS LIKE WARM TO COLD BECAUSE OF THIS.
BRAND NEW 2019 CAMRY WITH ISSUES . FRONT CRASH CAMERA WILL SAY THAT IT IS OFF BUT IT IS ON. APPLE CARPLAY RADIO FREEZES, GLITCHES AND SHUTS OFF.
THE CAR HAS AN ISSUE WITH SHIFTING FROM 1ST TO 2ND. WHEN PRESSING GAS PEDAL THE CAR BRIEFLY ACCELERATES AND THEN THE RPM DROPS AND THE CAR ALMOST DECELERATES. WHEN PRESSING THE GAS PEDAL AGAIN THE CAR STARTS TO JERK BACK AND FORTH UNTIL THE GAS PEDAL IS RELEASED. THE PROBLEM IS VERY REPRODUCIBLE AND MY SALES MANAGERS AT TOYOTA SUNNYVALE WERE TRYING TO CONVINCE ME THAT THIS IS NORMAL. THEY EVEN CLAIMED TO HAVE DRIVEN A NUMBER OF OTHER SIMILAR CARS AND TOLD ME THAT ALL OF THEM HAVE THIS "NORMAL" BEHAVIOR (WHICH CONFIRMS THAT A LOT OF CARS SHOULD HAVE THIS PROBLEM). THEY ALSO SAID THE CAR IS "LEARNING", WHICH IS TOTALLY BOGUS. AFTER APPROACHING THEM WITH SERVICE BULLETIN T-SB-0330-17 WHICH DESCRIBES THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM BUT FOR 2018 MODEL, THEY CLAIMED MY CAR CAN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM SINCE BULLETIN IS FOR 2018, BUT THE CARS HAVE EXACT SAME TRANSMISSIONS.
I rear ended a stopped tractor pulling a hay baler at 50 mph. my braking system sent no alerts nor did it brake for me. May airbags did not deploy. I sufferered a broken hand as a result of the impact.
Only the driver side door unlocks. Started with rear driver side door. Now only driver side door unlocks with key fob. Replaced battery and had fob program still same issue.
The contact owns a 2020 Toyota. The contact received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 23V865000 (Air Bags) however, the part to do the repair was unavailable. The contact stated that the manufacturer exceeded a reasonable amount of time for the recall repair. The dealer was contacted and confirmed that the remedy parts were not available. The manufacturer was not made aware of the issue. The contact had not experienced a failure. VIN tool confirms parts not available.
The high pressure fuel pump line suddenly ruptured at the high pressure fuel pump.  This happened without warning and spewed fuel all over the engine compartment and onto the exhaust system that comes out just below the engine.  It started a small fire on the engine exhaust pipe as I hurried to a mechanic across the intersection.  Luckily I was able to turn off the car and avoid damage.  The repair required a new high-pressure fuel pump as well as a line that runs into the pump.  I kept the original parts - the mechanics state that the replacement fuel line was different than the one removed from the vehicle in the shape of the line connector to the fuel pump.  I was told by Toyota that my car was NOT under recall despite there being fuel pump recalls for similar vehicles.
I had a feeling sick while driving my car. I placed a smoke and carbon monoxide detector in the cabin. The detector went off. I tried different things windows up windows down, recuperate open and close and detector alarmed. I brought my car to Doggett Toyota they found a leak in engine that was running to exhaust. I paid for $117 for estimate and $337 for part. The service department is pressing me to let them use my carbon monoxide detector. I refuse. When I went pick up the car fumes plus soap smell is still in the car. Detector still alarm 229ppm.They only offer to rent a ccar which I cannot drive because of health reasons. Other 2020 are carmys are recalled because oil leak and possibly damage to engine block. I requested my car be examined for the same problems as recall. The service department says I need ask corporate to send there own mechanic and I pay for it. Hours of run around miscommunication. That car is not safe to drive. Dealership doesn't have carbon monoxide detector or means to detect the smoke in the cabin. Service members all over the place, texting on cell phone, walking away while on phone with corporate etc.
I was driving the car without any issue or problem. All of a sudden the sunroof glass shuttered. It sounded like a blast. When I stopped the car, the sunroof was broken to small pieces.
Front bumper and side view mirror cover (passenger side) have been badly deformed with in past few months and getting worse for a vehicle which is still under warranty (~2 year old and under 36,000 miles). Side view mirror cover (driver side) has also started to deform.  Side view mirror cover (passenger side) has been deformed to an extent that a slight hand touch or push detaches it from the vehicle body which means it can become falling or flying object when vehicle is in motion and cause safety hazard.   Parts are available for inspection (pictures are also attached). I claimed the manufacturer warranty through a local Toyota dealership and after sending me from one dealership to another, my warranty claim was denied based on the reason that deformation is possibly due to heat reflection which is an outside influence. Other than taking pictures, dealership and manufacturer have not tried to replicate the failure of parts. Dealership & Manufacturer have also failed to rule out any safety issues due to deformed components. As a Toyota customer and vehicle owner, I am highly concerned about (1) If front bumper will function under deformed conditions as it is designed to function and will not cause any safety issues to the vehicle and its occupants (2) Deformed components (One of side view mirror is already started to detach) will not completely detach and become safety hazard. I am requesting NHTSA to investigate this matter which looks like a product failure and should be covered under manufacturer warranty or recall.
While opening the trunk from either the key fob or inside button release on the dash, the trunk lid flies open at high speed and hits the rear window of the car. It appears it's either a shock dampener failure or lack of one. I entered the date it occurred as the date I purchased the car.
I PURCHASE A BRAND NEW 2020 TOYOTA CAMRY MARCH 2020. ON JUNE 15, 2020 MY VEHICLE WAS PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY AND WOULDN'T START AND HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE DOORS WOULD NOT LOCK AND MY DASHBOARD DISPLAYED A MALFUNCTIONING SYSTEM PARKING BRAKE DISABLED. MY CAR REMAIN AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR 4 DAYS. ON JUNE 19 I PICKED UP MY VEHICLE. THE TOYOTA TECHNICIAN STATED THE BATTERY WAS GOOD AFTER PERFORMING A BATTERY TEST USING TOYOTA DCA8000 TEST.  THE  TECHNICIAN  PERFORMED AN UPDATE TELEMATICS MODULE I9I-13 DCM TO LATEST FIRMWARE TO SOFTWARE VERSION HIGH AT LG-N010FFB AND SOFTWARE VERSION LOW AT CBC-98 OR CBC-34  AS APPLICABLE DEALER TECHSTREAM  DIAGNOSTIC TOOL.   OK THIS WAS SUPPOSE TO BE THE FIX TO MY PROBLEM. ON AUG 19 THE SAME ISSUE HAPPENED AGAIN. AGAIN I HAD MY CAR TOWED TO THE SAME DEALERSHIP. AFTER A SERIES OF TEST THEY STATED IT WAS THE BATTERY, SO THEY REPLACED THE BATTERY WITH A NEW BATTERY. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT COULD BE THE BATTERY WHEN THIS IS A BRAND NEW CAR WITH LESS THAN 12,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE. . ON JAN 25, 2021 MY VEHICLE WAS PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY AND MY CAR WOULD START. THE RADIO CAME ON , THE LIGHTS WERE WORKING BUT THE CAR WOULDN'T START, THE STEERING WHEEL WOULDN'T MOVE AND THE CAR WOULDN'T GO INTO NEUTRAL. I HAD MY CAR TOWED TO MY DEALERSHIP AGAIN.  TECHNICIAN ADVISE THE NEXT DAY HAD  PERFORM A DCM RESET AND FIRMWARE UPDATE FOR DRAINING BATTERIES TO THE 2020 CAMRY. THIS VEHICLE HAS NOT PERFORM TO THE STANDARDS I EXPECTED SINCE DAY OF PURCHASE MARCH 2020.  STATE OF GEORGIA WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO SUBMIT A LEMON LAW CLAIM  BECAUSE VEHICLE WAS NOT OUT OF COMMISSION FOR 30 DAYS TOTAL. I AM A VERY UPSET CUSTOMER AND WILL CONTINUE TO FILE COMPLAINTS WITH TOYOTA HEADQUARTERS AND POSSIBLY SEEK ME A A CONSUMER ATTORNEY. AS MUCH AS I AM PAYING FOR MY VEHICLE I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WAIT AROUND FOR TOYOTA TO GET  THIS PROBLEM CORRECT.
WITHIN 2 WEEKS OF PURCHASING THE CAR I HAD THE FOLLOWING ISSUES:   THE KEYLESS KEY NOT WORKING, ENGINE IMMOBILIZER SYSTEM LIGHT WAS ON, ELECTRIC POWER STEERING SYSTEM WARNING LIGHT WAS ON AND THE CAR BATTERY WAS COMPLETELY DRAINED. CAR WAS STOPPED
THE DAY WAS PARTLY CLOUDY.  THE LOCATION WAS MARYLAND. THE VEHICLE WAS A NEW 2020 TOYOTA CAMRY SE 4DOOR.  WHILE DRIVING WITH MY SUNROOF EXTERIOR FLAT GLASS AND INTERIOR DOOR ASSEMBLY BOTH COMPLETELY CLOSED, MY DAUGHTER AND I SUDDENLY HEARD A BOOM EXPLOSION.  WHILE DRIVING TRYING TO SAFELY EXIT, HUGE BLACK CHUNKS WERE FLYING BEHIND US, THAT WAS LATER IDENTIFIED AS BROKEN SUNROOF GLASS FLYING BEHIND US HITTING THE VEHICLES TRAVELING BEHIND US. WE PULLED OVER AND GOT OUT OF THE CAR. WE DISCOVERED THAT MY VEHICLE'S SUNROOF HAD EXPLODED. INSTEAD OF THE REMAINING BROKEN SUNROOF GLASS EDGES EXHIBITING A CONCAVE DOWNWARD APPEARANCE, THE REMAINING SHATTERED GLASS EXHIBITED A CONVEX OUTWARD APPEARANCE INDICATING AN EXPLOSION HAD OCCURRED. TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A LOCAL MARYLAND TOYOTA DEALER FOR HELP AND WAS TOLD BECAUSE THE VEHICLE WASN'T PURCHASED FROM THEIR DEALERSHIP THEY COULDN'T HELP ME.  HENCE THE OEM GLASS REPLACEMENT COSTS WERE COVERED BY MY AUTO INSURANCE, WITH A $500 DEDUCTIBLE. A FEW DAYS LATER AFTER I RETURNING HOME, THE NEW OEM GLASS AND SUNROOF ASSEMBLY BEGAN TO SCREECH AND CRACKLED AS IF IT WAS COMING APART.  THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE RENIGGED ON THEIR PROMISE TO MAKE MY SUNROOF ASSEMBLY NEW AGAIN AT NO COSTS SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY.  NOW I DEAL WITH A CRACKLING AND SQUEAKING SUNROOF ASSEMBLY THAT MAKES ME FEARFUL OF THE SUNROOF EXPLODING AGAIN. NOTE:  THE PURCHASING DEALERSHIP FAILED TO COMPLY WITH MY AUTO SUNROOF GLASS AND ASSEMBLY THAT WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY AND REFUND MY AUTO INSURER AND ME AS THEY HAD PROMISED.

My 2021 Camry XLE Hybrid spontaneously developed a crack in the windshield. It reaches from the top edge on the passenger side and extends around the area of the mirror attachment towards the driver side. It is approximately 20 inches in length.  There was no impact, nothing hit the windshield and there are no signs of any damage. It happened while the car was in my garage while i was away traveling.
The contact owns a 2021 Toyota Camry. The contact stated while driving 5 MPH into a parking space with the brake pedal depressed, the vehicle lunged forward. There was no warning light illuminated. The vehicle was towed to the dealer but was not diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 16,500.
Grinding noise coming from front end upon acceleration. Brought to dealership who confirmed noises coming from transmission. Transmission needs to be replaced per dealer recommendation. Recalls on 2021 Toyota Camry for same issue. Transmissions on backorder and dealership isn’t sure when it will arrive. Unable to provide loaner vehicle until transmission arrives. Will replace with remanufactured transmission and not new per my request. Warranty will not restart at 0 miles even though transmission is “new”. Car has less than 30,000 miles and warranty is halfway thru term. Dealership unable to answer questions on what will happen if transmission fails again after warranty.
Vehicle was taken to the dealer due to AC malfunction. Upon inspection, the AC condenser was found to be damaged by a rock going thru the shield and sticking the line. The manager at the dealership indicated it was not uncommon. I contacted Toyota and the representative also indicated she has heard of similar issues. The matter was assigned to a case manager (Gable). He contacted me about the issue and indicated they would reach out to the dealership. According to the Toyota agent, this type of damage is not uncommon and not covered under bumper to bumper warranty.  The case manager admitted he never inspected the vehicle and relied on the dealership for an explanation. I spoke with Gable to inquire if it is a common occurrence, wouldn't it be beneficial to inspect the vehicle himself. If rocks can so easily go thru the shield, what's preventing a rock from possibly hitting the fuel line. This vehicle was bought brand new and maintained on a regular basis.  His response was they rely on the dealer's experience and expertise.  We live in a metropolitan area and don't go thru gravel roads. Not to exaggerate but if rocks can go thru the shield so easily, maybe the shield isn't providing adequate protection to vehicle components and more importantly the fuel line.  I wanted to bring this to your attention so there is a record of this matter having been brought to Toyota's attention. Case managers rely on the dealer for explanations instead of going out on the field to do an inspection themselves.

The contact had stated that he had NHTSA Campaign Number: 19V741000 (Air Bags) completed several years ago and related the failure of the air bag to inflate on the recall. The manufacturer was informed of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 120,000.

ON 08/30/2019 I WAS DRIVING DOWN A SUBURBAN CITY STREET GOING 40MPH AND SLOWED DOWN TO MAKE A LEFT TURN, BUT WAS UNABLE TO MOVE THE STEERING WHEEL BECAUSE IS HADU LOCKED UP AND WOULD NOT TURN.  I WAS TERRIFIED BECAUSE I HAD TO COME TO A COMPLETE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET BECAUSE THE CAR KEPT MOVING STRAIGHT AHEAD. I WAS AFRAID OF BEING HIT, BECAUSE I COULD GET THE STEERING WHEEL TO TURN. OUT OF DESPERATION AND FEAR, I GRABBED THE LEFT SIDE OF THE STEERING WHEEL WITH BOTH HANDS AND TRIED TO PULL DOWN TO MAKE THE STEERING WHEEL TURN...I WAS USING EXTREME FORCE, PULLING NUMEROUS TIMES BEFORE THE STEERING WHEEL FINALLY MOVED THE WHEELS TO THE LEFT SO I COULD MAKE THE LEFT HAND TURN.  BUT WHEN I TRIED TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL TO THE RIGHT TO STRAIGHTEN THE WHEELS AND CONTINUE MOVING STRAIGHT AHEAD, THE SAME THING OCCURRED....THE STEERING WHEEL REQUIRED EXCESSIVE FORCE, USING TWO HANDS PULLING DOWN ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE STEERING WHEEL REPEATED TIMES TO GET THE CAR IN POSITION TO MOVE FORWARD.  BY THE GRACE OF GOD, NO TRAFFIC CAME DOWN THE ROAD IN EITHER DIRECTION.  I CONTINUED TRAVELING DOWN THE STRAIGHT ROAD FOR TWO MILES, UNTIL I CAME TO A STOPLIGHT WHERE I HAD TO MAKE ANOTHER LEFT TURN.  WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN, THE SAME THING OCCURRED...I HAD TO REPEATED APPLY EXCESSIVE FORCE TO GET THE STEERING WHEEL TO TURN, WHICH SEEMED LIKE AN ETERNITY.  THIS TIME THERE WAS TRAFFIC BEHIND ME BEEPING THEIR HORNS TO GET OUT OF THE WAY, BUT SINCE THE POWER STEERING WAS NOT WORKING, IT TOOK ABOUT 1-2 MINUTES PULL THE STEERING WHEEL TO TURN THE CAR.  I TURNED ON THE FLASHER LIGHTS, DROVE 10MPH AND CONTINUED HOME.  THE CAR DROVE STRAIGHT: STEERING WHEEL LOCKED-UP AND REQUIRED EXESSIVE FORCE FOR NEXT FOUR RIGHT/LEFT TURNS I HAD TO MAKE TO GET HOME. AFRAID TO DRIVE CAR; INJURED RT ROTOR CUP USING SUCH FORCE TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL.TAKING TO TOYOTA DEALER TOMORROW FOR DIAGNOSIS.
MY CAR SUDDENLY TURN ON MOST OF THE DASH LIGHTS: BRAKE,ABS, POWER STEERING, AND THE SPEEDOMETER , TEMPERATURE GAUGE, REVOLUTION GAUGE AND AIR CONDITIONER STOP WORKING. THE VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY WHEN ALL TIS PROBLEMS STATED START TO HAPPEN
SUMMARY:  THE SUBJECT VEHICLES ARE EQUIPPED WITH FRONT PASSENGER AIRBAG INFLATORS PRODUCED BY TAKATA. ACCORDING TO TAKATA, THE PROPELLANT IN THESE INFLATORS MAY DEGRADE AFTER PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO HIGH ABSOLUTE HUMIDITY AND FLUCTUATING HIGH TEMPERATURES. DEGRADED PROPELLANT CAN CAUSE INFLATOR RUPTURE DURING AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT.  SAFETY RISK:  IN THE EVENT OF AN INFLATOR RUPTURE, METAL FRAGMENTS COULD PASS THROUGH THE AIRBAG CUSHION MATERIAL, STRIKING THE VEHICLE OCCUPANTS, AND RESULT IN SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH.  REMEDY:  THE REMEDY WILL CONSIST OF THE REPLACEMENT OF THE AIRBAG INFLATOR OR THE AIRBAG ASSEMBLY, DEPENDING ON THE VEHICLE MODEL.

TAKATA RECALL. I WOULD LIKE TO FILE A COMPLAINT. I BOUGHT MY TOYOTA IN 2010 BRAND NEW. I'M HAVE BEEN DRIVING IT AROUND WITH MY CHILDREN IN THE CAR WITH THESE DANGEROUS AIRBAGS.

IS TOYOTA JUST WAITING FOR PEOPLE TO GET KILLED OR SERIOUSLY HURT?  JUST LIKE VW THEY HAD TO BUY BACK THE CARS AND THEY WEREN'T EVEN A DANGER. BUT WE ARE DRIVING IN THESE DANGEROUS CARS EVERY DAY.

TRUNK FOR 2010 COROLLA DID NOT STAY OPEN WHEN WIFE OPENED TRUNK TO ACCESS ITEMS.  LID EDGE HIT BRIDGE OF HER NOSE, CAUSING A SMALL CUT, AND SWELLING.

I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY GOING ABOUT 70MPH. MY EXIT WAS COMING UP ON THE RIGHT SIDE SO I PUT MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE TO SLOW DOWN. HOWEVER THE BRAKE STUCK AND THE VEHICLE WOULDN'T SLOW DOWN, IT KEPT GOING. I HAD THE CRUISE CONTROL ON, AND USUALLY IF I BRAKE WITHOUT FIRST TURNING IT OFF IT SLOWS DOWN, BUT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. SO I TURNED THE CRUISE CONTROL OFF BUT NOTHING HAPPENED. MY CAR KEPT GOING. I PUSHED DOWN ON THE BRAKE, BUT THAT MADE THE CAR ACCELERATE EVEN MORE. I CHECKED TO MAKE SURE THE PEDAL WASN'T STUCK, IT WASN'T, BUT I KNEW THAT WASN'T THE PROBLEM BECAUSE MY CAR WAS ACCELERATING WHEN I WAS HITTING THE BRAKE. LUCKILY THERE WAS NO ONE IN FRONT OF ME BECAUSE I WAS GOING OVER 110MPH. I SPED AT THIS SPEED FOR QUITE A WAYS MAYBE 3/4 OF A MILE. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE AND HAD MY PHONE IN MY HAD TO CALL 911. I KEPT PUSHING ON THE BRAKE SINCE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO (THIS OF COURSE MADE ME GO FASTER AND FASTER). THE BRAKE WOULDN'T GO DOWN THOUGH. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS HAPPENING. IT WAS LIKE STUCK? FINALLY I HEARD MY ACCELERATE POP. AND THE CAR STARTED TO DECELERATE.  *TR
THE DRIVER-SIDE AIRBAG FAILED TO DEPLOY IN A SIDE-IMPACT COLLISION.  THE ESTIMATED SPEED OF IMPACT WAS BETWEEN 40 & 45 MPH, DIRECTLY STRIKING BETWEEN THE DRIVER DOOR AND THE FRONT DRIVER-SIDE WHEEL.  TOYOTA CORPORATE CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER WAS CONTACTED, AND REPLIED THAT THE SYSTEM PERFORMED AS DESIGNED.  WHILE NOT AN EXPERT IN AIRBAG DESIGN AND OPERATION, I CANNOT IMAGINE A MORE CLEAR-CUT SITUATION WHERE THE AIRBAG SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED TO PROTECT THE OCCUPANTS.  THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN DECLARED "TOTALED" BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY, BUT PHOTOS OF THE VEHICLE ARE AVAILABLE.  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 TOYOTA COROLLA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING 30 MPH, THE VEHICLE DECELERATED INDEPENDENTLY AND JERKED FORWARD. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN AUTHORIZED DEALER THREE TIMES AND THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED THAT THE TORQUE CONVERTER WAS SEIZING. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED AND SENT AN ENGINEER TO EXAMINE THE VEHICLE. THE ENGINEER ADVISED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS OPERATING AS DESIGNED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 9,258. ..UPDATED 09-19-12 *BF    THE CONSUMER STATED THE GAS PEDAL IS TOO SENSITIVE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN LOW SPEEDS. THE VEHICLE WAS ONCE RECALLED FOR THIS PROBLEM. THE CONSUMER FEELS THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS. UPDATED 09/21/2012 *JS
I NOTICE THAT MY TRUNK DOESN'T REMAIN UP AFTER I OPEN IT. THIS IS CAUSING THE HOOD TO COME DOWN ON MY HEAD. IT IS VERY DANGEROUS. THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THAT THE DRIVER'S DOOR OPENS OUT TOO FAR.  *TR
2010 RAPID ACCELERATION WHEN PUSHING DOWN THE BRAKE PEDAL.    THE DRIVERS FLOOR MAT WAS LOOSE & WHEN I PUSHED ON THE BRAKE MY HEELS PUSHED THE MAT INTO THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL.    3 TOYOTA DEALERS SAY NO RECALLS GROSSINGER - OAK BROOK / WESTMONT & LIBERTYVILLE...  *TR

1. 2010 TOYOTA COROLLA S WAS PURCHASED FROM A TOYOTA DEALER WITH 8 MILES.  RIGHT AFTER GOING OFF THE LOT, AND ONTO THE FREEWAY, CAR WAS UNSTABLE.  EVEN IF YOU HOLD THE STEERING WHEEL STRAIGHT, THE CAR WANTS TO JUMP LEFT AND RIGHT RANDOMLY.  BASICALLY IT IS UNSTABLE.  2. CAR IS UNSTABLE AND REQUIRES MORE THAN NORMAL CONCENTRATION AND MORE EFFORT TO DRIVE STRAIGHT, AS CAR DOES NOT TRACK STRAIGHT.  3. VEHICLE WAS BROUGHT TO DEALER WITH APPROXIMATELY 185 MILES.  TEST DROVE WITH TECHNICIAN, WHO SAID IT VEERS SLIGHTLY RIGHT.  ALIGNMENT WAS DONE.  THE FRONT WAS OFF BY A BIT AND CORRECTED.  BUT REAR OF CAR WAS OUT OF SPEC WITH REGARDS TO LEFT AND RIGHT TOE.  BASICALLY BOTH REAR WHEELS FACING TOWARDS THE LEFT.  TOYOTA DEALER SAID THEY ARE UNABLE TO REPAIR THIS PROBLEM.  I BRING IN A TOYOTA TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN THAT ADDRESSES ON-CENTER STEERING FEEL.  THE DOCUMENT REQUIRES ALIGNMENT DONE, THEN POWER-STEERING ECU REPLACED.  MY ECU IS THEN REPLACED AT THE DEALERSHIP, BUT ALIGNMENT IN REAR IS NOT ADJUSTED, SINCE THE DEALER SAID IT IS NOT ADJUSTABLE.  THEY GIVE ME BACK THE CAR WITH THE NEW ECU EVEN IF REAR TOE IS OFF ALONG WITH TOTAL REAR CAMBER.  THEY ALSO SAY THAT TOTAL REAR TOE IS CORRECT AT .38 DEG, BUT EVEN IF LEFT AND RIGHT REAR TOE IS OFF, AS LONG AS TOTAL REAR TOE IS GOOD, CAR IS WITHIN TOYOTA SPECIFICATIONS AND TOLERANCES.  I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE STATEMENT.  IF LEFT AND RIGHT TOES ARE OFF, THEN CAR IS NOT ALIGNED.  RIGHT REAR TOE IS OUT OF SPEC BY .15 DEGREES WHILE LEFT REAR TOE IS OFF BY -.09 DEGREES.  I TAKE THE CAR AND DRIVE IT FOR 1 DAY AND A HALF, AND THE CAR VEERS RIGHT ON THE FREEWAY.  IF IT HITS A BUMP ON A TURN, IT USUALLY MAKES THE CAR WANT TO JUMP RIGHT.  BASICALLY PROVING THAT THE REAR TOE IS OUT OF SPECIFICATIONS. *TR
TOYOTA 2010 COROLLA.  SUDDEN ACCELERATOR PROBLEM:  AFTER HAVING THE RECALL UPDATE TO OUR COROLLA, A FEW MONTHS LATER, WE EXPERIENCED A SUDDEN ACCELERATION PROBLEM WITH OUR CAR.  FROM A PARKED POSITION NEXT TO THE CURB, WE PUT OUR FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND THEN PUT  THE CAR IN REVERSE TO BACK AWAY FROM THE CAR IN FRONT OF US, AND THE CAR SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND PROCEEDED TO  JUMP OVER A CURB AND HIT A TREE NEXT TO US ON THE SIDE WALK. AGAIN, THIS WAS WHEN THE CAR WAS IN REVERSE, SO THE ACCELERATION WAS GOING BACKWARDS, WITH OUR FOOT ON THE BRAKE.  AFTER TAKING OUR CAR TO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP FOR CONSULTATION ON SEPT 7TH, THEY INDICATE THAT THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR AND WE WOULD NEED TO CONTACT TOYOTA DIRECTLY ON THIS PROBLEM. IT IS NOW NEARLY A MONTH LATER, AND WE STILL HAVE NOT BEEN "VISITED" BY THE TOYOTA ENGINEERING TEAM.  WE WERE ASSIGNED A CASE NUMBER BY TOYOTA AND TOLD TO WAIT TO HEAR FROM THEM.  WE ARE STILL WITHOUT OUR CAR AND WAITING SOME KIND OF FORMAL INSPECTION FROM THE TOYOTA CORPORATE TEAM.  THE LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER IS TRYING TO HELP AS WELL AND IS ALSO CONTACTING TOYOTA CORPORATE FOR ASSISTANCE.  THIS IS NOT FAIR TO BE WITHOUT OUR CAR AND SOME REASSURANCE FROM TOYOTA THAT THIS WON'T HAPPENED AGAIN TO OUR CAR.  AS OF THIS DATE OCTOBER 1, 2010, NO INSPECTION HAS TAKEN PLACE ON OUR CAR. WE'RE STILL WAITING. *TR

I BOUGHT A 2010 TOYOTA COROLLA S IN JUNE OF 2009.  WHENEVER I WOULD BE DRIVING ON ROUGH AND UNEVEN ROADS AND HAD TO USE MY BRAKES THEY WOULD NOT WORK.  THE CAR WOULD KEEP MOVING FORWARD WITHOUT SLOWING DOWN WHEN I WOULD APPLY MY BRAKES.  THIS HAPPENED ALL OF THE TIME EVEN AFTER I TOOK MY CAR TO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP FOR THEM TO INSPECT AND FIX THE PROBLEM.  I TOLD THEM ABOUT THIS WHEN I WOULD TAKE MY CAR IN FOR AN OIL CHANGE AND ROUTINE MAINTENANCE AND THE MECHANIC ASSURED ME THAT IF THERE WERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH MY BRAKES THAT THEY WOULD FIND IT AND FIX IT BECAUSE THEY DO A COMPLETE CHECK OF MY CAR AND IT FUNCTIONS WHEN THE DO THE ROUTINE MAINTENANCE AND CAR DIAGNOSTIC.  HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM STILL CONTINUED AND I HAD ROUTINE MAINTENANCE ON MY CAR 3 DIFFERENT TIMES. MY CAR WAS ALSO TAKEN TO THE SAME TOYOTA DEALERSHIP FOR THE SAME PROBLEM DURING TIMES IT DID NOT NEED MAINTENANCE AND AFTER TAKING MY ENTIRE BREAK SYSTEM APART AND STILL NOT FINDING ANYTHING, THEY TOLD ME THAT EVERYTHING LOOKED FINE.  HOWEVER, THIS WAS NOT THE CASE BECAUSE THE FIRST UNEVEN ROAD I DROVE ON MY BREAKS DID NOT WORK PROPERLY AND THE VSC SYMBOL IMMEDIATELY CAME ON AND MY CAR STARTED MAKING THIS CONSTANT ANNOYING BEEPING SOUND THAT WOULDN'T GO AWAY.  THEREFORE I CALLED TOYOTA TELLING THEM ABOUT IT AND THEY SAID TO BRING THE CAR BACK, SO I DID.  THEY SAID THEY FOUND A LEAK IN ONE OF MY HOSES.  SOMETHING THAT THEIR CAR DIAGNOSTIC COMPUTER NEVER CAUGHT WHEN I INITIALLY COMPLAINED TO TOYOTA ABOUT THIS PROBLEM WHICH EXISTED SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR.  AFTER GETTING THE CAR BACK THIS TIME THE PROBLEM SEEMED TO IMPROVE A LITTLE BUT WAS STILL MOVING FORWARD WHEN I WOULD BREAK ON UNEVEN AND ROUGH ROADS.....I ALSO TOLD THE TOYOTA PEOPLE THAT THE BREAK PROBLEM THE PRIUS WAS HAVING SEEMED TO BE THE SAME BRAKE PROBLEM MY COROLLA WAS HAVING.  ALTHOUGH I AM AWARE THAT THE BRAKE SYSTEM IN THE PRIUS IS PROBABLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF MY COROLLA, BECAUSE THE PRIUS IS A HYBRID.  PERHAPS THERE IS A CONNECTION. *TR
I HAVE A 2010 TOYOTA COROLLA. I AM SCARED TO DRIVE IT ON THE HIGHWAY.  THE STEERING IS VERY SENSITIVE AND I CANNOT KEEP IT ON THE ROAD IF OVER 65 MPH. IT FEELS LIKE YOUR ARE HYDROPLANING, THE WIND IS BLOWING YOU ALL OVER THE ROAD.  MY BOYFRIEND FOLLOWED ME HOME AND SAID IT LOOK LIKE I WAS DOING DWI ON I-95.   IF THE WIND BLOWS JUST A LITTLE BIT, YOU ARE ALL OVER THE ROAD. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS,  I HAVE TAKEN IT BACK TO THE DEALER 3 TIMES.  THE FIRST TIME THE SALESMAN EXPLAINED IT WAS ELECTRICAL STEERING AND I WILL GET USE TO IT.  THE SECOND TIME WAS WITH THE TECHNICIAN WHO WOULDN'T GO WITH ME ON THE I-95 AND TWICE THE ALIGNMENT.  THE 3RD TIME 2 DAYS LATER AND THAT IS WHEN THEY COULDN'T HELP ME AND SAID THEY LOGGED IT WITH TOYOTA.  I AM VERY MAD AND UPSET.  I FEEL I PURCHASED MY CAR IN GOOD FAITH AND NOW I AM STUCK WITH A CAR COSTING $353 AMONTH FOR THE NEXT 5 YEARS, THAT IS A CHORE TO DRIVE ON THE HIGHWAY. THIS IS MY 3RD TOYOTA IN 20 YEARS.  I AM VERY UPSET BECAUSE I DIDN'T DRIVE ANY OTHER VEHICLE BEFORE PURCHASING THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE I TRUSTED TOYOTA.  I HAVE LOGGED A COMPLAINT WITH OFFICE OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS UNDER THE LEMON LAW AND WITH THE MANUFACTURE. I FEEL I HAVE BEEN BETRAYED BY TOYOTA B/C THEY WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND LIED TO ME THE FIRST 2 TIMES.  MY NAME IS [XXX], I CAN BE CONTACTED AT [XXX] AND MY EMAIL ADDRESS IS [XXX].    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6). *TR
TL*THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 TOYOTA COROLLA. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 5 MPH THROUGH A CAR WASH, THE CONTACT NOTICED THAT WATER WAS LEAKING THROUGH THE SUNROOF AREA. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN AUTHORIZED DEALER WHO COULD NOT DIAGNOSE THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE RECURRED; THEREFORE, THE CONTACT TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALER. THE DEALER RESTATED THAT THERE WERE NO FAILURES BUT INSTRUCTED THE CONTACT TO HAND WASH THE VEHICLE INSTEAD OF TAKING IT THROUGH A CAR WASH; THE DEALER ALSO STATED THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED ON TWELVE 12-15 VEHICLES OUT OF 20. THE FAILURE CONTINUED TO OCCUR. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 2,501. THE CURRENT MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 4,000.
2010 TOYOTA COROLLA LE WHICH SUDDENLY VEERS LEFT OR RIGHT AT HIGH SPEEDS (45MPH OR GREATER).  WHILE HOLDING THE STEERING WHEEL PERFECTLY STRAIGHT, THE CAR WILL WANDER LEFT OR RIGHT CAUSING THE DRIVER TO CORRECT THE STEERING AND PAY EXCESSIVE ATTENTION TO SIMPLY KEEPING THE CAR IN ITS OWN LANE.    THIS OCCURS ALL THE TIME WHEN DRIVING ABOVE 45MPH.  NO ACCIDENT HAS TAKEN PLACE, BUT I FEAR FOR MYSELF AND MY FAMILY MEMBERS WHO DRIVE THE VEHICLE.  AS A RESULT, WE HAVE DRIVEN THE CAR SPARINGLY OR ONLY FOR LOCAL DESTINATIONS WHICH DO NOT REQUIRE TAKING A HIGHWAY.    I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO A DEALERSHIP WHERE THE SERVICE ADVISOR ADMITTED THAT THE STEERING IS "TOO SENSITIVE" CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO "WANDER" AND THAT WHILE THERE IS "NO FIX FOR IT YET [HE] HOPES FOR A FIX SOON."  REGARDLESS OF THESE STATEMENTS, HE WROTE ON MY SERVICE PAPERS THAT THE VEHICLE "ROAD TESTED NORMAL CHARACTERISTIC."  A MONTH LATER, I CALLED THE SERVICE ADVISOR AGAIN TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PROBLEM STILL PERSISTING.  I REQUESTED TO BRING IN THE CAR FOR AN ADDITIONAL REVIEW OF THE PROBLEM.  HE DENIED MY REQUEST BY STATING THAT "THERE'S NO POINT IN BRINGING IN THE CAR UNTIL A FIX IS ISSUED."    I THEN BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP, WHICH WAS NOT HELPFUL AT ALL.  THEY OUTRIGHT DENIED MY CLAIM THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM AND STATED ON MY SERVICE PAPERWORK THAT THE "VEHICLE DRIVES NORMAL" AND THAT THEY "CANNOT DUPLICATE THE CUSTOMER CONCERN."    NO FIX HAS BEEN DONE AND THE VEHICLE SITS IN THE GARAGE VIRTUALLY UNTOUCHED (LESS THAN 800 MILES) WHEN IT WAS BOUGHT OVER 3 MONTHS AGO.  *CN

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 TOYOTA COROLLA. WHILE STOPPED AT A STOP SIGN THE VEHICLE RMP WENT UP TO 3,000 SHE HAD TO PARK THE VEHICLE FOR A WHILE FOR IT TO SLOW DOWN. SHE HAD EXPERIENCED THESE FAILURE SEVERAL TIMES. THE CONTACT STATED THAT A FEW WEEKS AFTER SHE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE SHE NOTICED THE  BRAKES WERE SLOW TO RESPOND WHEN SHE DROVE 35 MPH OVER SPEED BUMPS OR ANY HOLES. SHE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER TWICE. THE DEALER STATED THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN TEST DRIVEN AND THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE FAILURES. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 10,000 AND THE CURRENT MILEAGE WAS 12,000.
I HAVE A 2010 TOYOTA COROLLA THAT FREQUENTLY HAS A STRONG GAS SMELL AND ON 3 DIFFERENT OCCASIONS THE STEERING HAS GIVEN ME A SENSE OF CONTROL LOSS SIMILAR TO THE SENSATION OF HYDROPLANING. *TR
THIS WAS NOT A FAILURE, BUT MORE OF A CONSTANT PROBLEM. MY 2010 TOYOTA COROLLA HAS A SERIOUS TENDENCY TO WANT TO WANDER IN THE LANE. I DRIVE TO WORK EVERYDAY ON THE EXPRESS WAY, ABOUT 25 MILES. IT REQUIRES CONSTANT MONITORING AND ADJUSTMENTS TO KEEP THE VEHICLE TRACKING STRAIGHT. IT ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE THE CAR IS ALWAYS ON A SLIPPERY ROAD, EVEN WHEN THE PAVEMENT IS DRY. AS SPEEDS INCREASE THE PROBLEM INCREASES; IT IS ALWAYS PRESENT. NEVER WORSE AT ONE TIME THAN ANOTHER. I HAVE NOT REPORTED THIS ISSUE TO THE DEALER, BUT I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TODAY AT 12:30 FOR THE GAS PEDAL RECALL, I WILL INFORM THEM OF THE ISSUE AS WELL. *TR
2010 TOYOTA COROLLA -- STEERING PROBLEM.  VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP CAR WITHIN TRAVEL LANE WHEN DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEED. THIS IS NOT RELATED TO WIND GUSTS BUT OCCURS AT ALL THE TIMES.  FEELS LIKE THERE ARE DEAD SPOTS IN THE WHEEL AND THERE IS LITTLE TO NO ROAD FEEL FEEDBACK.  THE CAR DOES NOT TRACK STRAIGHT ON ITS OWN BUT REQUIRES CONSTANT STEERING CORRECTIONS.  I AM 69 YEARS OLD AND HAVE OWNED AND DRIVEN MANY CARS/TRUCKS INCLUDING MY 2002 TOYOTA AVALON AND MY DAUGHTER'S 1993 COROLLA AND HAVE NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED THE TYPE STEERING ISSUE THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR NEW 2010 TOYOTA COROLLA.  I BELIEVE THIS TO BE SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE AND IF A DRIVER IN NOT PAYING 100% ATTENTION AND CONSTANTLY CORRECTING TO KEEP CAR WITHIN THE TRAVEL LANE THE RESULT COULD BE DISASTROUS.  TOYOTA NEEDS TO BE REQUIRED TO FIX THIS STEERING ISSUE WITH ITS NEW COROLLA'S.  [THIS OCCURS ALL THE TIME - BUT YOUR FORM FORCES ME TO ENTER AN INCIDENT DATE SO I AM JUST USING JAN 1, 1901 TO PROCEED WITH THE FORM.  UPDATED 03/19/10.*JB
WHILE DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE IN SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF 75 MILES AN HOUR, MY 2010 COROLLA SHAKES VIOLENTLY IN ALL CONDITIONS. I ALSO HAVE AN ISSUE WHEN SLOWING DOWN WHERE THE GAS PEDAL WILL TAKE LONGER THAN WHAT IS EXPECTED TO RETURN TO AN ACCEPTABLE AREA AND STOP ACCELERATING. THIS SECOND ISSUE HAS NEARLY CAUSED SEVERAL ACCIDENTS. I HAVE BROUGHT THIS UP TO THE DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE SOME THREE MONTHS AGO AND WAS TOLD A SOLUTION IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE AND I WILL BE CONTACTED WHEN ONE IS. BOTH PROBLEMS HAVE CONVINCED ME TO CARPOOL TO WORK UNTIL A SOLUTION IS IDENTIFIED.  *TR
2010 TOYOTA COROLLA - STEERING WHEEL MOVES RIGHT OR LEFT AUTOMATICALLY ABOVE SPEED OF 40 MPH. *TR
FOR CAR BRAKING SYSTEM: AS YOU PRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL, YOU HAVE TO PRESS IT REALLY HARD FOR IT TO START TO STOP THE CAR,IF YOU STOP THE CAR, AND RELEASE THE BREAK PEDAL THE CAR GOES SO FAST THAT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU ARE PRESSING THE GAS PEDAL ( BUT NOBODY IS PRESSING NO PEDAL AT ALL). THE BRAKING ON A SHALLOW ROAD MAKES THE CAR SHAKE ESPECIALLY THE BRAKING PEDALS AND IT MAKES NOISE, AND AT THE SAME TIME IT IS NEEDED TO PUT SOME EXTRA FORCE AND PUSH THE BRAKES REALLY HARD FOR IT TO WORK, THE ROAD DOES NOT NEED TO BE THAT BAD FOR IT TO HAPPEN, AT TIMES IT HAPPENS ON A VERY SMALL DEPRESSION. *TR
WE HAVE A 2010 TOYOTA COROLLA. WE BOUGHT IT FOR OUR DAUGHTER TO COMMUTE TO COLLEGE. IT WAS PURCHASED IN MAY 2009 FROM FREEDOM TOYOTA IN HARRISBURG, PA. AFTER QUESTIONING HER ABOUT ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE GAS PEDAL, SHE SAID THE 'STUCK PEDAL SYNDROME'  HAPPENED TO HER ALSO THIS PAST FALL. IT WAS TAKEN CARE OF BY A DEALER IN ALLENTOWN, PA. SHE THEN ALSO MENTIONED THAT THE STEERING WHEEL 'JERKS OUT OF HER HAND' WHEN DRIVING. THIS HAS HAPPENED TO HER MORE THAN ONCE. THE DEALER IN ALLENTOWN WAS TOLD OF THIS, ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT SHE HAD A PROBLEM WITH HER DRIVER SIDE WINDOW NOT ROLLING DOWN WHEN THE SWITCH WAS ACTIVATED. THIS HAPPENED TO HER ONCE. THIS DEALER COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE 2 ABOVE MENTIONED OTHER PROBLEMS. I TOLD HER SHE IS TO DOCUMENT ANY FUTURE ISSUES WITH THIS CAR. I AM ESTIMATING THE INCIDENT DATES. SHE SAID THEY TOOK PLACE IN THE FALL SEMESTER. I DO NOT HAVE THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS TO WHAT HER SPEED WAS AT THE TIME THE STEERING WHEEL HAD A HABIT OF JERKING OUT OF HER HAND. I DO KNOW THAT THERE IS HIGHWAY COMMUTING INVOLVED ALONG WITH NON HIGHWAY DRIVING INVOLVED. *TR
I BOUGHT A 2010 TOYOTA COROLLA S ON OCT. 22, 2009. AT BITTERROOT MOTORS IN MISSOULA, MONTANA. THE DAY AFTER I BOUGHT THE CAR I DROVE IT TO OVANDO, MONTANA, NORTH OF MISSOULA, ON A TRYOUT ROAD TRIP. I NOTICED THAT IT WAS FLIGHTY ON THE ROAD AND SEEMED TO WAVER WITHOUT REASON (NO WIND, NO SEMI TRUCKS, WIND SHEAR, RAIN, ETC). BEING A NEW CAR TO ME, I PASSED IT OFF AS THE NATURE OF A LIGHTER AND SMALLER VEHICLE THAN WHAT I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DRIVING (MY OTHER VEHICLE IS A 2004 FORD F150). SINCE THAT TIME, I HAVE CONTINUALLY EXPERIENCED THIS WITH NO EXTERNAL EXPLANATION (IE: WEATHER, ROAD CONDITIONS, ETC). THIS PROBLEM SEEMS TO HAPPEN AT SPEEDS OF 50 MPH AND OVER AND IT IS A CONSISTENT ISSUE. I COMMUTE REGULARLY BETWEEN STEVENSVILLE, MT., AND MISSOULA, MT., FOR WORK (28 MILES ONE WAY), AND I OFTEN FIND THAT THE CAR WILL DRIFT LEFT OR RIGHT WHEN I AM AT A STEADY SPEED. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT MY VEHICLE IS ON THE LIST OF RECALLS FOR THE RECENT ACCELERATOR ISSUE. I NEED TO ADD HERE THAT THE SECOND DAY AFTER BUYING THE CAR, I WAS GETTING FUEL AND AS I TURNED FROM THE PUMP TO RE-ENTER THE CAR, "POP!!" AND THE DRIVER SIDE WINDOW TOTALLY SHATTERED. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE DEALER AT BITTERROOT MOTORS AND DROVE IT TO THEIR SERVICE DEPT TO GET IT FIXED. THEY REPLACED THE WINDOW UNDER WARRANTY, AND TOLD ME THEY SUSPECTED IT WAS A PREEXISTING STRESS FRACTURE IN THE GLASS THAT FINALLY GAVE. I BOUGHT THIS CAR BASED ON SAFETY RATINGS, CONSUMER REPORTS RATINGS, AND TO GET BETTER GAS MILEAGE ON MY NECESSARY TRIPS TO AND FROM WORK. IT ISN'T HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE STRESS OF THIS SITUATION, NOT TO MENTION ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. I PAID FOR THE CAR OUTRIGHT ($18,075) AND IT PHYSICALLY SICKENS ME TO THINK THAT SUCH SERIOUS ISSUES EXIST. I HAVEN'T EVEN OWNED IT 5 MONTHS! AT THIS POINT I AM FEARFUL OF EVEN DRIVING THE CAR. IF THE WORLD WORKED IN GOOD WAYS, TOYOTA WOULD REPLACE THIS VEHICLE COMPLETELY, AND PREFERABLY WITH SOMETHING OTHER THAN ANOTHER TOYOTA. *TR

MY 2010 TOYOTA COROLLA HAS BEEN DRIFTING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS SINCE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE. IF I TAKE MY EYES OFF THE ROAD FOR A SECOND TO GLANCE AT MY REAR VIEW MIRROR OR SIDE VIEW MIRRORS, THE COROLLA WILL BEGIN TO DRIFT TO THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT. THE DRIFTING USUALLY BEGINS AROUND THE 40 MPH MARK. I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALERSHIP BUT THEY CLAIM THAT THEY ARE NOT FINDING ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR. *TR
FOR ENTIRE TIME OWNED - THERE IS A GAP OF SECONDS BETWEEN PRESSING GAS PEDAL AND ACTUAL ACCELERATION. WHEN I PRESS GAS PEDAL THERE IS A HESITATION LEADING ME TO PRESS HARDER. THEN OF COURSE THE CAR HAS A SUDDEN SPRINT IN ACCELERATION. THIS IS NOT SAFE. I HAVE HAD THE CAR FOR 5.5 MONTHS SO I AM GETTING BETTER AT WAITING INSTEAD OF PRESSING HARDER. BUT I FEEL THIS IS DEFINITELY A DEFECT. I INQUIRED OVER PHONE WITH SERVICE MANAGER WHERE I PURCHASED - EXPLANATION: I AM NOT USE TO A 4 CYLINDER, WHICH I BELIEVED BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER DRIVEN A 4 CYLINDER. BUT, I AM BEGINNING NOT TO BELIEVE THIS EXCUSE.  *TW
2010 TOYOTA COROLLA S DRIFTS TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT AT SPEEDS ABOVE 40 MPH MAKING CAR REQUIRE CONSTANT ADJUSTMENT TO STAY IN LANE. LONGER TRIPS ARE EXHAUSTING AS THE CAR HAS TO BE ACTIVELY STEERED AT ALL TIMES TO KEEP FROM WANDERING OUT OF THE LANE.

The contact owns a 2011 Toyota Corolla. The contact stated while driving approximately 70 MPH, the air bag warning light illuminated. The contact also stated the air bag warning light was frequently illuminated; however, the warning light no longer was illuminating. The vehicle was previously repaired under an air bag recall. The vehicle had not been diagnosed or repaired since. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 43,600.
WHENEVER I AM DRIVING BETWEEN 15-25 MPH, THE VEHICLE FEELS LIKE IT'S DRAGGING WITH CRUISE CONTROL ON.THE RPM WOULD RANDOMLY SURGE THEN DROP AS THE VEHICLE GOES OVER 25 OR  UNDER 15MPH.

WE WERE TOLD IF THE AIRBAGS MALFUNCTION IT CAN BE DEADLY AND HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT SINCE THE NOTICE WAS SENT IN FEBRUARY 2017. THIS IS A HUGE INCONVENIENCE FOR OUR FAMILY!  WHEN WILL SOMETHING BE DONE ABOUT THIS DELAY?!? THIS PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED IMMEDIATELY!
TAKATA RECALL.  I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR TOYOTA TO REPLACE MY AIRBAG FOR OVER TWO YEARS BUT I DO NOT SEE ANY ACTION FROM TOYOTA.  I DO NOT ALLOW ANYONE TO SIT IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT DUE TO THE FEAR OF SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH IF THE SITUATION ARISE TO THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE AIRBAG.

TAKATA RECALL    IT HAS BEEN OVER 1 YEAR SINCE WE WERE NOTIFIED OF THE TAKATA AIRBAG RECALL. TOYOTA HAS STILL NOT FOUND A SOLUTION AND THERE ONLY REMEDY IS TO NOT HAVE A PASSENGER SIT IN FRONT OF THE CAR. THIS RENDERS THE CAR USELESS TO CARRY 4 PASSENGERS.
TAKATA RECALL  I BELIEVE TOYOTA HAS TAKEN AN UNREASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO RESOLVE THE TAKATA INFLATOR ISSUE. THE INTERIM NOTICE FOR THE RECALL IS DATED MAY 23, 2016 ON TOYOTA'S WEBSITE. I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY DIRECT (MAIL) CORRESPONDENCE UNTIL DECEMBER 2016, IN WHICH THE LETTER SAID TO WAIT UNTIL A REMEDY BECOMES AVAILABLE. SINCE THEN, IT HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCONVENIENCE TO AVOID HAVING PASSENGERS RIDE IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT.

TAKATA RECALL- I RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF A TAKATA AIRBAG RECALL ON MY TOYOTA COROLLA IN JULY 2016. THERE HAS BEEN NO WORD FROM TOYOTA REGARDING WHEN MY AIRBAG WILL BE EXCHANGED. I LIVE IN TEXAS WHICH IS CONSIDERED A "RED" ZONE WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES CYCLING AND HUMIDITY. I WANT THE AIRBAGS IN MY CAR REPLACED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND I AM GETTING NOWHERE WITH THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP OR THE TOYOTA MANUFACTURER.
TAKATA RECALL - I HAVE OWNED A TOYOTA COROLLA 2011 FOR ABOUT 2 YEARS NOW, & WITHIN 6 MONTHS OF BUYING THIS CAR FROM A DEALERSHIP I GET NOTICE FROM TOYOTA THAT MY CAR HAS THE FRONT PASSENGER AIRBAG RECALL. I HAVE CALLED CORPORATE TOYOTA ABOUT 5 TIMES IN 8 MONTHS AND STILL TO THIS DAY, THEY HAVE NO ANSWER FOR WHEN THEY CAN FIX THIS ISSUE, AND ALL OF THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIPS I HAVE GONE TO IN MY AREA (3 OF THEM) CANNOT HELP FIX MY VEHICLE AS WELL. I ASKED IF I COULD TAKE OFF MY PASSENGER AIRBAG UNTIL IT BECOMES FIXED AND THEY SAID "NO". SO NOW I LITERALLY AM DRIVING A DEATH TRAP. I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE ANYONE IN MY FRONT PASSENGER SEAT, BUT I HAVE A FAMILY, HOW THE HECK CAN I NOT HAVE SOMEONE IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT. TBH I DON'T KNOW IF THIS AIRBAG ISSUE FOR TOYOTA WILL EVER BE FIXED. ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS FIXED THE PROBLEM IN A TIMELY MANNER, LIKE A YEAR OR SO. IT'S BEEN ALMOST 2 YEARS AND STILL THEY CAN'T GIVE A FIX DATE. NICE JOB TOYOTA. PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE.  *TR

THIS IS A NEW CAR PURCHASE (W/200 MI).  AT 60-75 MPH (AND NOTICEABLE ALSO AT SLOWER SPEEDS ON OTHER ROADS) ON THE FREEWAY THE CAR'S STEERING WANDERS ALL OVER THE ROAD, IT CANNOT STAY ON A STRAIGHT LINE EVEN IF THE STEERING WHEEL IS NOT MOVED.  TRUCKS PASSING BY DO NOT APPEAR TO GREATLY EFFECT STEERING.  WIND WAS NOT AN ISSUE. THIS, NOT A LOOSENESS BUT RATHER INACCURATE STEERING, CAUSES A WANDERING WHICH IS VERY DANGEROUS AS THE CAR WILL WANDER INTO ANOTHER LANE OR OFF THE ROAD INTO  A POTENTIAL CRASH.  THE DRIVER IS 57, WITH 200-300K MILES DRIVING EXPERIENCE IN MERCEDES TO BMW TO VOLVOS TO GM TO OTHER TOYOTAS  TO FORD CARS - W/O AN ACCIDENT.  THIS IS A REAL AND SERIOUS PROBLEM WHICH MAY CAUSE DEATHS.  THERE APPEARS TO BE LITTLE CONTROL BETWEEN THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE STEERING.  THE TIRES HAVE THE PROPER AIR PRESSURE (GOODYEAR).  I REPEAT, THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS NEW CAR I HAVE DRIVEN SINCE 1968.  THAT'S PROBLEM #1.    PROBLEM #2, A LESSER PROBLEM BUT ALSO RIDICULOUS.. IS THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL.  YOU CANNOT KEEP THE SPEED CONSTANT AT 45-50 MPH.  HOLDING THE ACCELERATOR STEADY THE ENGINE SPEED, AS SHOWN IN THE TACHOMETER ,WILDLY JUMPS UP AND DOWN AT WILL, INTERMITTENTLY, RPM GOING FROM 1600 TO 2200.  IF YOU HOLD STEADY IT DROPS TO 1600, IF YOU THEN DEPRESS THE PEDAL THE SMALLEST POSSINE ABOUT, IT JUMPS TO 2200, THEN BACK TO 1600.  OTHER TIMES THE SAME ACTION WORKS AS YOU WOULD EXPECT A LINEAR PRESS ON THE ACCELERATOR WOULD COMMAND A LINEAR INCREASE IN SPEED.  THE ENGINE/TRANSMISSION SPEED CONTROL IS ALL OVER THE PLACE WITH NO FEEDBACK TO THE DRIVER. LOOK... I HAVE EXAMINED THIS ON EMPTY ROADS.  IT'S THE MOST RIDICULOUS CONTROL SYSTEM I HAVE EVER USED.  IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE AND IT'S POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS.  I CANNOT BELIEVE IT WOULD PASS SAFETY STANDARDS>  PLEASE CORRECT THESE 2 ISSUES BEFORE DEATHS OCCUR.  I WILL SWEAR TO THIS.  *TR
IMMEDIATELY AFTER PURCHASE WE NOTICED A TRANSMITTION PROBLEM WHERE THERE WAS A FLUXUATION OF RPM WHILE DRIVING AT 40 - 65 MPH.  THE COMPUTER IS TELLING THE TRANSMITTION TO SHIFT FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON.  IT CAN NOT FIND A CRUSE GEAR TO REMAIN AT SPEED.   *TT
Airbag needed to be replaced....again.  This vehicle has had many recalls before, but now I am forced to pay for an additional replacement.  Airbags are supposed to last the lifetime of the vehicle.  Toyota not covering this $1000 expense is ridiculous and unsafe.
CORROSION TO THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION OIL COOLER HOSE OCCURRED IN THE METAL PIPE PORTION OF THE COOLER LINE, SPECIFICALLY THE TOP LINE, (NOT SURE IF THAT'S 'IN' OR 'OUT') CAUSING A LEAK IN ATF.  NOT ONLY THAT, BUT CORROSION TO BOTH BOLTS THAT HOLD THIS LINE IN PLACE AND CAUSED THE BOLTS TO SNAP WHEN TRYING TO REPLACE THIS LINE.

TAKATA RECALL - RECALL IS TAKING WAY TOO LONG.  TOYOTA CAN'T EXPECT A FAMILY OF 4 TO HAVE NO ONE SIT IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT FOR NEARLY A YEAR.  PEOPLE PAY GOOD MONEY FOR THEIR VEHICLES AND ITS SAFETY FEATURES.  IT SHOULDN'T TAKE SO LONG FOR A REMEDY TO BE AVAILABLE FOR BUYERS.
TAKATA RECALL. RECALL CAME OUT IN JANUARY AND INFLATOR STILL NOT REPLACED. MY 4 SEAT CALL HAS BEEN CHANGED TO A 3 SEAT CAR. THIS IS NOT WHY I BOUGHT THIS CAR. I WANT THE INFLATOR REPLACED ASAP.
AIR BAG PASSENGER SIDE WAS RECALLED! DEALER DID ISSUE RECALL NOTICE, BUT SO FAR, NO ACTION HAD BEEN TAKEN!

TAKATA AIRBAG RECALL... BOUGHT THIS CAR USED THRU DEALERSHIP & NO ONE TOLD ME THAT IT'S BEEN RECALLED A FEW YEARS AGO & IT'S SAFETY ISSUE FOR MY 3 YEAR OLD  & MYSELF.
TAKATA RECALL ISSUED JANUARY 2017  HAVE HEARD NOTHING 8 MONTHS LATER FROM TOYOTA OR TAKATA.  I FEEL 8 MONTHS A REASONABLE TIME TO BE CONCERNED THAT NOTHING IS BEING DONE FOR SAFETY SAKE OF ME, THE DRIVER OR ANYONE ELAPSE IN MY CAR IF THE AIR BAG DEPLOYS! I LIVE IN FLORIDA WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES AND HUMIDITY WHICH ARE HARD ON THE MECHANISM OF THE AIR BAGS
TAKATA RECALL - I LIVE IN FLORIDA, A HIGH HUMIDITY AREA, AND RECEIVED A NOTICE EARLY 2017 REGARDING THIS RECALL.  I WAS INFORMED THAT IT WOULD BE BEST FOR NO ONE TO RIDE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT OF THE VEHICLE.  SEVERAL MONTHS HAVE PASSED AND I HAVE NOT BEEN NOTIFIED OF WHEN THE REPAIRS COULD BE MADE.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.  IT SEEMS THE MATERIALS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE TO REPAIR THE DEFECTIVE AIRBAG UNTIL DECEMBER OF 2017, IF THEN.  THIS VEHICLE IS OUR MODE OF TRANSPORTATION FOR WORK, VISITING FAMILY AND ATTENDING CHURCH.  WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO USE THE PASSENGER SEAT.  THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT IS TAKING TO MAKE THE NECESSARY REPAIRS IS, IN MY OPINION, EXTREME.  THE BIRTH OF OUR CHILD HAS INCREASE THE CONCERN WE HAVE ABOUT RIDING IN THIS VEHICLE. THIS DEFECT HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR OVER A YEAR AND EFFORTS TO MAKE THE REPAIRS SHOULD HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE WITH THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES AFFECTED.
TAKATA RECALL  WE RECEIVED AN AIRBAG RECALL EARLY SPRING OF 2017 AROUND MARCH AND WE HAVE CONTACTED OUR LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP TO SEE WHEN WE COULD TAKE THE VEHICLE IN FOR REPAIRS AND HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY WOULD CONTACT US WHEN THE NEW INFLATORS WOULD BE IN STOCK TO DO THE REPAIRS. IT IS NOW AUGUST 10 2017 AND WE STILL HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THEM. THIS IS TAKING A VERY LONG TIME AND I AM HAVING TO PUT EXTRA MILES ON OUR OTHER VEHICLE TO GO ON FAMILY TRIPS/OUTINGS BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT ANY PASSENGERS IN THE FRONT SEAT DUE TO THE DEFECT.
RECALL NOTICE RECEIVE BUT NOTHING ELSE EVER RECEIVED FOR ISSUE TO BE REPAIRED. NO INCIDENT AT THIS TIME BUT NEED REPAIRED BEFORE ANYTHING HAPPENS. I PUT IN TODAYS DATE SINCE NO INCIDENT THUS FAR. HOW CAN I GET THIS REPAIRED.

TAKATA RECALL  AS THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN 11 VERIFIED DEATHS, AND TAKATA HAS PLED GUILTY TO DECEIVING THE GENERAL PUBLIC, I HAVE FOUND THAT MY CAR IS UNDER THIS RECALL.  HOWEVER, IT STATES THAT THERE IS NO FIX YET.  I DRIVE MY CAR EVERY DAY TO WORK, WITH MY CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN.  THERE ARE PRECIOUS LIVES AT STAKE.  I NEED THIS ADDRESSED AND FIXED NOW! NOT LATER!
TAKATA RECALL.  I WOULD JUST REALLY LIKE TO KNOW HOW LONG I HAVE TO WAIT TO HAVE THIS FIXED.  IT'S TOTALLY UNREASONABLE TO DRIVE WITH NO PASSENGERS FOR A SUPER LONG TIME.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 TOYOTA COROLLA. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 60 MPH, THE STEERING WHEEL BECAME DIFFICULT TO MANEUVER WITHOUT WARNING.

THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 30,000.
WHILE WAITING FOR THE TRAFFIC LIGHT TO CHANGE AND MY FOOT ON THE BRAKES, THE CAR SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND DESPITE SHIFTING TO PARK AND PULLING ON THE EMERGENCY BRAKE THE CAR CONTINUED TO REV VERY HIGH FOR SEVERAL MINUTES. JUST PRIOR TO ACCELERATION, THE CAR'S BRAKES BECAME VERY SOFT AND SUNK ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR OF THE CAR AS IF SOMEONE HAD DEPRESSED THE POWER IN THE BRAKE LINE. I TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AND WAITED FOR ABOUT 2 MINUTES AND RESTARTED THE CAR. THE ENGINE RACED AGAIN AT VERY HIGH SPEEDS WITH THE EMERGENCY BRAKE ON AND THE CAR SET AT "PARK." I TURNED THE CAR OFF AGAIN AND WAITED FIVE MINUTES. THE CAR STARTED NORMALLY AND I THEN CALLED MY WIFE TO PICK ME UP. SHE DROVE THE CAR BACK HOME AND NOTICED THE BRAKES WERE VERY MUSHY AND SHE FELT A SLIGHT ACCELERATION. WE TOOK IT TO OUR TOYOTA DEALERSHIP SINCE IT WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY AND THEY FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR AND ASSERTED THAT I DEPRESSED BOTH THE BRAKE AND THE GAS PEDAL AT THE SAME TIME, WHICH IS UTTERLY RIDICULOUS.  WE HAVE OWNED THE CAR FOR 18 MONTHS AND NOTHING LIKE THIS HAS EVER HAPPENED. THERE WERE MORE THAN FIVE WITNESSES TO THIS AS I HAD BLOCKED TRAFFIC AT THE LIGHT'S INTERSECTION WHILE OTHER CARS WENT AROUND ME WHILE THE CAR WAS RACING. I HAVE FILED AN INCIDENT REPORT WITH TOYOTA BUT IT DOES NOT LOOK AS IF ANYTHING WILL BE DONE WITH THE UNINTENDED ACCELERATION ISSUE. I AM A FORMER LAWYER AND I TAKE MY COMPLAINTS VERY SERIOUSLY. PLEASE HELP.   *TR

I BOUGHT MY VEHICLE UNDER WARRANTY AT AROUND 7000 MILES. BEFORE 36000 MILES I HAD TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER 3 TIMES WITH COMPLAINTS OF BAD FRONT WHEEL BEARING. THEY GAVE ME THE RUN AND AROUND AND I ENDED UP REPLACING THE DEFECTIVE BEARING NOW 3 TIMES. NOW I AGAIN HAVE TO REPLACE THE BEARING ON THE BACK WHICH COMES NOW COMPLETE WITHOUT HAVING TO BE PRESSED IN. I HAVE HEARD FROM OTHERS THAT THIS CAR IS ANONYMOUS FOR THIS PART BEING DEFECTIVE WHICH I THINK IT'S UNFAIR FOR THE CONSUMER. THIS PART IS CLOSE TO OVER 200$. I WAS ALSO TOLD BY THE DEALER ON FIRST OCCURRENCE THAT IT WAS MY TIRES CAUSE THE VEHICLE WORE THEM UNEVENLY. THE CONSUMER IS NOT BEING INFORMED, PROTECTED AND SOLD BAD QUALITY PARTS ON VEHICLES AND THE PRODUCER IS NOT BEING HELD RESPONSIBLE.

*STEERING*  I WENT TO VISIT MY DAD & RUN SOME ERRANDS IN LA COUNTY ON JULY 6TH 2013. I RESIDE IN ORANGE COUNTY SO I HAD TO GET ON THE FREEWAY. THE SPEED LIMIT ON CALIFORNIA FREEWAYS IS 65 MILES PER HOUR.

NOW I'M NOT SO SURE.   *TR
The AC compressor is failing as it’s blowing hot air at idle or when the vehicle is running at 20-40mph. During Texas hot summers, baby & toddlers are at risk for extreme heat as the AC blows hot/warm air. The problem has been reproduce at an automotive AC shop where they have inspected the AC for leaks, vacuumed refrigerant and replaced refrigerant. Still same issues without any leaks. Police or insurance has not been involved. There are no dash lights when this happens and the issue happens daily which started 3 years ago. The vehicle is driven less because of the issue. There is a TSB T-SB-0086-14 that says this is covered within 36k mile warranty or 3 years. I bought the vehicle with 48K miles and about 2 years later the AC blows hot air at idle.
That’s completely great with good conditions

HELLO,  I DRIVE 100 MILE EVERY DAY FROM PITTSBURGH, CA TO HAYWARD, CA FOR SCHOOL. I RECENTLY PURCHASED A 2014 COROLLA LE, BECAUSE I WANTED A RELIABLE CAR FOR MY DAILY COMMUTE. I HAVE NOTICED AT SPEEDS OVER 60 MPH, MY CAR SEEMS TO BE BLOWN AROUND BY WIND AND THERE IS NO WIND GUST STRONG ENOUGH TO DO THAT. I HAVE VISITED THE DEALERSHIP (DUBLIN TOYOTA) TWICE IN OTHER TO FIND OUT THE PROBLEM, THEY SAID EVERYTHING IS UP TO SPEC. THEY HAVE DONE ALIGNMENT AND EVEN ADJUSTED THE TIRE PRESSURE, YET THERE IS NO IMPROVEMENT ON THE STEERING OR HANDLING OF THE CAR. THE CAR WAVES ON THE FREEWAY AND IT IS A STRUGGLE TO KEEP IT IN ONE LANE. I REALLY FEEL UNSAFE IN THE CAR AND I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING INCLUDING LOADING UP MY CAR WITH WEIGHT IN ORDER TO MAKE HEAVIER. I KNOW SOMETHING IS EITHER WRONG WITH THE REAR SUSPENSION AND AXLE OR THE POWER STEERING IS SIMPLY BAD. PLEASE FIND OUT WHY THIS IS THIS WAY FROM TOYOTA, BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING THE CAR ON THE FREEWAY. I NOTICED THIS PROBLEM STARTING THE DAY I BROUGHT THE CAR.  *TR
My car paint had a recall. It was denied.
I had a NIKA Supercharger tire on drivers front inside tread/ sidewall separation I checked the front passenger and rear passenger tires, and they are also separating the same way and in the same place. The tires are barely two years old and were not worn out. Something is wrong with these tires. I was lucky I had not got on the interstate yet when the tire failed. Tire size 215/45/R17-91W XL These tires are not Toyota supplied tires and were on the car at time of purchase. They are the proper size for the car however.

12/09/2019,  The ECU did not have adequate protection against certain electrical noise that occurred during the collision. Airbags did not deploy in the event of under ride collision, a freak accident involving wildlife crossing the street. Seat belt pretensioners did not engage. I called Allstate insurance that same day. Had I not worn my seat belt, I might have gone through the windshield. Safety was in danger, and not protected. Meineke informed me the oil housing component, fused onto the component that allows for an oil change because it was made with a plastic material, that is an incorrect material, Oxygen sensor lit up after that finding. Vehicle is not available for inspection upon request. Tyler Law Enforcement might have inspected the vehicle in general.

I WAS DRIVING MY NORMAL COMMUTE TO WORK YESTERDAY (JUNE 6, 2019), HEADING WEST ON BROWARD BLVD AT ABOUT 45 MPH. I WAS APPROACHING A RED LIGHT, SO I PRESSED THE BRAKE PEDAL AS USUAL...EXCEPT NOTHING HAPPENED!! I'M NOT SURE IF IT EVEN SLOWED AT ALL BECAUSE I WAS PANICKING SINCE THERE WAS NOWHERE TO GO. I PRESSED DOWN HARDER, AND STILL NOTHING! SO, I KNEW I WAS GOING TO IMPACT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME, AND I DID. I WAS SO CONFUSED. IT WAS THE SCARIEST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE! NOT ONLY THAT. NOW, MY RIGHT LEG IS SORE FROM BRAKING SO HARD, AND MY AIRBAGS DEPLOYED. SO, MY INSURANCE COMPANY MAY DECLARE MY CAR A TOTAL LOSS. I'M SO FRUSTRATED AND UPSET. I'M JUST HAPPY THAT THE PERSON I HIT WAS OKAY WITH NO INJURIES. I'M ALSO HAPPY TO BE ALIVE, BUT THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING BECAUSE I'VE ALREADY SPENT SO MUCH ON THAT CAR AND CAN'T IMAGINE INCURRING ANOTHER FINANCIAL BURDEN TO PURCHASE A NEW ONE.

MY HUSBAND AND I WERE DRIVING HOME FROM A CONCERT AT 10:30 PM ON THE 110 FREEWAY IN SAN PEDRO, CA WHEN WE HEARD A LOUD CRASH ON THE ROOF OF THE CAR.  WE HADN'T JUST DRIVEN UNDER AN OVERPASS.  THERE WAS NO DEBRIS BEHIND US.  NO ONE WAS SWERVING OUT OF THE WAY TO AVOID ANYTHING.  NO ONE WHO DROVE PASSED US REACTED AT ALL.  WE COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT HAD HIT US AND KEPT HEARING GLASS MOVING AROUND.  AT ONE POINT MY HUSBAND OPENED THE SUNROOF SLIGHTLY AND SAW A GAPING HOLE IN THE GLASS ALONG WITH GLASS SHARDS THAT STARTED FALLING INTO THE CAR.  WHEN WE GOT HOME I LOOKED UP "EXPLODING SUN ROOFS" AND FOUND THAT SPONTANEOUS EXPLOSION WAS NOT UNCOMMON AND THERE IS A CLASS ACTION SUIT FORMING AND PEOPLE REPORTED THEIR EXPERIENCES TO YOU.

REFERENCE: NHTSA ID NUMBER: 10865853. ADDITIONAL INFO - SNAPSHOT ATTACHED. UNABLE TO UPLOAD AUDIO FILE (AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST)  THIS IS ABOUT "SQUEAKING/CREAKING" NOISE THAT EMANATES FROM BOTH FRONT SEAT BELTS SINCE PURCHASE OCT 2015. THE EVENT OCCURS WHEN DRIVER ACCELERATES, DECELERATES, GOES OVER SPEED BUMPS OR UNEVEN ROADS. THE ISSUE DID NOT GO AWAY AFTER DRIVER SEAT WAS MOVED BACK AND FORTH TO ENSURE PROPER ENGAGEMENT IN SEAT TRACK.(NOTE - THIS VEHICLE TRIM HAS MANUAL SEAT ADJUSTMENT).  THE CREAKING SOUNDS IS AS IF A BOLTED JOINT HAS COME LOOSE. OTHER DRIVERS HAVE REPORTED THAT THIS ISSUE WAS DUE TO THE SEAT BELT BOLT STRIPPING LOOSE.  THE ISSUE IS MORE PRONOUNCED IN COLD WEATHER.   THE "SQUEAKING" GOES AWAY WHEN THE SEAT BELT IS UNBUCKLED.     THE "SQUEAKING/CREAKING" RESUMES WHEN THE BELT IS BRACED TIGHT AGAINST DRIVER AND VEHICLE ACCELERATES OR DECELERATES, OR GOES OVER UNEVEN ROAD OR BUMPS.   THESE DB LEVELS ON THESE SQUEAKS HAVE INCREASED WHERE EVERYONE SEATED IN THE CAR CAN NOW HEAR IT. THE INCIDENTS ARE STILL SPORADIC.
To whom it may concern, I would like to report that my vehicle's paint has been peeling off since June 2018. The vehicle was purchased on 8/11/17, and I have continuously reported the paint problem to no avail from the dealership or manufacturer. As a matter of fact, in February 2019, the vehicle was serviced to due bubbles developing around the windshield, and I again reported the paint issues and received no resolution to my problem. Hence, I would like to know whether my case is an isolated one or just like the white paint settlement, Toyota has deceived some of its customers that chose blue paint in this model (Corolla).
The contact owned a 2017 Toyota Corolla. The contact stated while driving at 40-45 MPH, she saw an object on the road. The contact stated that as she was trying to swerve to the right to avoid the sharp object, the vehicle drove over the sharp object. The sharp object pierced the tires and the subframe. The vehicle hit the curb and bounced back into the road.  The was an unknown fluid leaking. The air bags did not deploy. The contact sustained back injuries. The contact did not seek medical assistance. The vehicle was towed to a tow lot where it was totaled. There was no further information provided. The dealer and the manufacturer were not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 20,300.
I HAD A CAR ACCIDENT ON JANUARY 15, 2021. MY CAR WAS TOTALED AND NONE OF MY AIR BAGS DEPLOYED. MY EMERGENCY BRAKE SENSOR DIDN'T GO OFF AS WELL WHICH USUALLY ALWAYS GOES OF FOR ANY MINIMAL CLOSE OBJECT. BECAUSE OF MY AIR BAG NOT DEPLOYING I CUT MY LIP OUTSIDE AND INSIDE GOING TO THE HOSPITAL AND GETTING A STITCH IN THE INSIDE OF MY LIP. I HAD A HOLE THE WIDTH OF A DIME FROM HITTING THE STEERING WHEEL AND BLED NON STOP FROM MY NOSE AND LIP/MOUTH. THE HOSPITAL HAS IN MY CHART THE PICTURE OF THE HOLE.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2017 TOYOTA COROLLA. THE CONTACT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 20V024000(AIR BAGS) HOWEVER, THE PART TO DO THE RECALL REPAIR WAS NOT YET AVAILABLE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE MANUFACTURER HAD EXCEEDED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THE RECALL REPAIR. TOYOTA WALNUT CREEK LOCATED AT (2100 N BROADWAY, WALNUT CREEK, CA 94596) WAS CONTACTED AND IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THE PARTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE ISSUE.

SHIFTING OF TRANSMISSION IN VEHICLE HESITATES AND/OR IS INCONSISTENT UPON SUDDEN ACCELERATION OR DECELERATION, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR THE DRIVER TO DETERMINE THE ACCELERATION OF THE VEHICLE VERSUS OTHER CARS ON A BUSY STREET. THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS INSTANCES IN WHICH THE CAR IS NOT SHIFTING APPROPRIATELY AND I AM UNABLE TO ACCURATELY JUDGE ENTERING TRAFFIC FROM A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD ONTO A BUSY INTERSECTION AS THE CAR WILL SOMETIMES SHIFT/REACT TO THE DRIVER AND OTHER TIMES NOT. AT TIMES THE TRANSMISSION REACHES AND REMAINS AT 7, 000 RPM (IN RED) WITHOUT SHIFTING AND/OR IS SLOW IN RESPONSE TO ACCELERATION. A CAMPAIGN RECALL WAS ISSUED BY TOYOTA FOR WHICH THE TRANSMISSION SOFTWARE WAS REPROGRAMMED ON THE VEHICLE; HOWEVER, THESE ISSUES STILL REMAIN. MY ULTIMATE CONCERN IS THE SAFETY OF MY CHILDREN AND MYSELF WHEN DRIVING THIS CAR AS I AM NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO PREDICT HOW IT WILL DRIVE UPON SUDDEN NEEDS TO ACCELERATE OR DECELERATE. IT IS MOST NOTABLE IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC, STOPS ON A HILL, OR NEED FOR INCREASED ACCELERATION GETTING ON THE HIGHWAY. WEATHER TEMPERATURE, HIGH WINDS, PASSENGER LOAD ALL SEEM TO BE VARIABLES IN HOW THE CAR SHIFTS. THE CAR DRIVES/SHIFTS INCONSISTENTLY FROM DAY TO DAY. WHEN NOT SHIFTING, IT RAISES MAJOR CONCERNS I WILL MAKE THE WRONG DETERMINATION WHEN JUDGING TRAFFIC THAT MAY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. I HAVE CONSISTENTLY RAISED THESE CONCERNS WITH THE DEALERSHIP FROM THE TIME OF FIRST OIL CHANGE (PURCHASED NEW) TO CURRENT (31,000 MILES). TOYOTA HAS ALSO REVIEWED; HOWEVER, I AM CONCERNED THERE IS BIAS IN THE TRUE OPERATION OF THE VEHICLE AS THERE COMMENT WAS "DRIVING AS DESIGNED'. IT WAS STATED BY TOYOTA THAT IT COSTS SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS TO UPDATE THE SOFTWARE AND THAT IT WOULD NOT BE UPDATED UNTIL ENOUGH OF THESE CASES WERE KNOWN. I AM SUBMITTING THIS REQUEST FOR AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF THE TRANSMISSION ISSUES IN THIS MODEL YEAR.
DISAPPOINTED WITH TOYOTA ON THIS, LAST ONE I WILL PURCHASE IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE A FIX! WHILE IN MOTION ON EVERY OCCASION THE CRUISE CONTROL IS ENGAGED AND THE VEHICLE IS ON A DECLINE THE CRUISE CONTROL DOES NOT MAINTAIN THE SET SPEED. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME OF 4 OTHER COROLLA'S I HAVE OWNED THAT RESPONDED LIKE THIS.  DEPENDING ON THE SEVERITY OF THE DECLINE THE SPEED WILL INCREASE FROM 5 TO 15 MPH AND THE ENGINE REVS TO 4,000 RPMS IN AN ATTEMPT TO MAINTAIN SPEED.  ADAM'S TOYOTA DEALERSHIP HAS STATED THAT THIS IS A NORMAL OCCURRENCE FOR ALL 2017 COROLLA'S CVT'S AND I MAINTAIN IT'S NOT AND CRUISE IS USELESS THEREFORE I SHOULD BE REIMBURSED.  THE CRUISE CONTROL IN ALL OTHER VEHICLES (PRIOR COROLLA'S AND OTHER MAKES) I HAVE OWNED HAS MAINTAINED A CONSISTENT SPEED NO MATTER THE ROAD BEING TRAVELED. SINCE I HAVE OWNED THIS VEHICLE THIS ISSUE HAS OCCURRED EVERY TIME I HAVE ENGAGED THE CRUISE CONTROL.  OTHERS ONLINE HAVE COMPLAINTS ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL. TOYOTA PLEASE PROVIDE FIX
I PURCHASED BRAND NEW COROLLA 2017 LAST YEAR AND IT IS OFFCOURSE UNDER WARRANTY AND I HAVE REGULAR SERVICE AS ASKED BY DEALER. THIS EVENING I PLAN WITH MY FAMILY TO GO OUT AND ONCE I GET NEAR TO MY CAR I SAW MY REAR SCREEN IS SHATTERED AND I WONDERED WHAT CAUSE THIS AND FOUND NO IMPACT BY ANYTHING EXTERNAL. I TOOK SOME PICS AND LOOK MORE IN DETAIL AND FOUND THAT IT WAS SHATTERED ITSELF DESPITE IT WAS NOT VERY HOT OR COLD WEATHER. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT IT AS WHAT IT HAVE HAPPENED HAVING MY LITTLE KID IN CAR OR MY WIFE. PAYING REASONABLE COST OF VEHICLE AND GETTING POOR SAFETY MAKE ME THINK OF LOGGING THIS COMPLAINT AND I AM SURE SOMEONE WILL LOOK IN TO IT AND WILL RAISE THIS CONCERN WITH AUTHORITIES AND PUBLIC SAFETY NOTICE TOO WITH COROLLA OWNERS/DRIVERS. ONE MORE THING IT WAS PARKED AS USUAL AND IT WAS PARKED IN PRIVATE AREA.
ON INTERSTATE IN WESTERN MARYLAND AND WEST VIRGINIA, ROAD CURVES TO LEFT, GOING UPHILL (STEEP) AT 70 MPH AND 4000+ RPM IN DRIVE, 3 LANES, TRUCK IN "SLOW" RIGHT LANE (40MPH), COROLLA IN MIDDLE LANE, LEFT LANE EMPTY.  SAFET SENSE "SEES" TRUCK AND HITS BRAKES.  NO ONE BEHIND, THANKS.   POSSIBLE REAR END COLLUSION.  SERIOUS SAFETY FAULT.  DIFFICULT FOR COROLLA TO REGAIN SPEED.  DOES NOT HAPPEN ON RIGHT CURVE AS THOSE VEHICLES IN LEFT LANE ARE MOVING FASTER THAN COROLLA.
WHILE USING CRUISE CONTROL ON FAIRLY LEVEL ROADWAY, (RURAL ROAD) AT A SPEED OF 45 MPH, THE RPM WERE ABOUT 1500, BUT INCREASED SUDDENLY TO ABOUT 4500 RPM.  AFTER AWHILE THE RPM WOULD DROP BACK DOWN TO NORMAL FOR THE SPEED SITUATION.  THIS OCCURS ALSO AT HIGHWAY SPEED OF 60 MPH IN OUR AREA.  THIS OCCURRENCE HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES.  HAVE RETURNED TO DEALER TWICE NOW.  PROBLEM WAS OBSERVED BY SERVICE MANAGER AND LOCAL TOYOTA REP WHO WAS IN TOWN FOR LOCAL AUTO SHOW.   CAR WAS ANALYZED AND DATA SEND TO ENGINEER IN CALIFORNIA WHO LATER SAID CAR IS BEHAVING NORMAL.   I FOUND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE AS BOTH LOANER CARS (2017 COROLLA) DID NOT BEHAVE IN THIS DANGEROUS FASHION.   I FEEL THIS QUICK BRUSH OFF BY THE ENGINEER (TANAKA) WHO IS ONLY OBSERVING DATA AND NOT HAVING TO DRIVE THIS CAR IS WRONG.   I FEEL THE COMPUTER SHOULD BE ADJUSTED FOR THE CVT TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.   WIFE DOES NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE.  WE HAVE TAKEN 3 VIDEOS TO DOCUMENT THIS EVENT.
Hello, dear sir and madam I haven't seen any incidents so far because I drive according to Virginia law.
While driving at 55 mph, cruise control engaged, the vehicle suddenly lost power, the cruise control disengaged, the engine light came on and the traction control disengaged warning was displayed. The vehicle continued operating. After engine fault code stated there was a Mass Airflow Sensor fault. Owner replaced the sensor. Two weeks later, the situation repeated, this time the fault read as an oxygen sensor error. After a day or two, the fault would clear, only to repeat a week or two later. Then, on Dec. 31, the vehicle completely stalled at highway speeds. It would restart, but if the rpms exceeded 2,500 it would stall again. Trying to get an appointment with the dealership, but will have to wait until after the New Year for them to open again.
THE SUBJECT VEHICLES ARE EQUIPPED WITH A LOW-PRESSURE FUEL PUMP WHICH MAY STOP OPERATING. IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR, WARNING LIGHTS AND MESSAGES MAY BE DISPLAYED ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL, AND THE ENGINE MAY RUN ROUGH. THIS MAY RESULT IN A VEHICLE STALL, AND THE VEHICLE MAY BE UNABLE TO BE RESTARTED. IF A VEHICLE STALL OCCURS WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHER SPEEDS, THIS COULD INCREASE THE RISK OF A CRASH.
TL* TAKATA RECALL. THE CONTACT OWNS A 2018 TOYOTA COROLLA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE FUEL WARNING LIGHT DISPLAYED ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS.

TAKATA RECALL- I WAS INVOLVED IN A SERIOUS FIVE CAR  ACCIDENT WHICH MY 2018 TOYOTA COROLLA'S AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY.
I got an “engine maintenance requested” notification on my car. I took it to a mechanic and they said the coolant bypass valve is defected
At around 36,500 miles, my Toyota Corolla began experiencing issues with the coolant bypass valve, leading to engine overheating. This malfunction has significantly impacted my ability to drive safely, as the vehicle displays a notification every five seconds, obstructing my view of the digital speedometer and making it difficult to accurately monitor my speed. The issue was not indicated by a check engine light but a persistent "Engine Maintenance Required" message.   This defect poses a serious safety risk, and there's a potential class-action lawsuit in progress regarding this very issue, suggesting Toyota might have known about the defect but failed to disclose it. The faulty component is not available for inspection upon request. As more people began to experience similar circumstances, it could lead to fatalities. Other participants to the forums says the issues start when their covered warranty expires. Within these forums there's a inconstancy of service centers honoring fixes, with no cost, knowing that there is an issue.  I took the car to both a third-party mechanic and an authorized dealership, and both confirmed the problem. I was quoted $732.85 for the parts and labor within my area. I also called Toyota Global which I was told "a low mileage car shouldn't be having this issue", however, there are countless of forums saying otherwise.  **Toyota Models Affected** 2019 Toyota RAV4 2020 Toyota RAV4 2021 Toyota RAV4 2022 Toyota RAV4 2023 Toyota RAV4 2019 Toyota Corolla 2020 Toyota Corolla 2021 Toyota Corolla 2022 Toyota Corolla 2023 Toyota Corolla  [XXX]  [XXX]  [XXX]  [XXX]  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
On February 17, 2024 I was involved in a hit and run.  I was T-boned on the passenger side and the front passenger door wouldn't open and no airbags deployed.   Later on in February I received a Toyota Airbag Contol Unit Settlement. I haven't ever received an recall information on any recalls for my vehicle.
Motor mounts failed on a 2019 Toyota Corolla.  Replaced for an exorbitant amount of money.  Never had this happen on any of my cars.  Engine was rocking back and forth when acceleration and when I stopped.   This could have damaged other components in the car resulting in my safety.
Purchased a 2019 toyota corolla from carvana that was delivered 2/26/22. When delivered, driver pointed out front end date that apparently happened "during transport". Vehicle had bad brakes & rotors that I replaced. Vehicle has one door that does not match the rest of the car. The history was disclosed as clean, no accidents. Carvana is refusing to switch the car out and has no record of me asking for it to be switched with an undamaged car. Payments are being made to bridgecrest and are on time despite me telling them I would return the car if they didn't cancel the loan for this defective car.
THERE IS A SEVERE SAFETY ISSUE WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL. IN READING COROLLA ON-LINE FORUMS, IT APPEARS THAT IT HAS BEEN A TOYOTA PROBLEM FOR QUITE SOME TIME ' NOT SOMETHING SPECIFIC TO MY VEHICLE ALONE.   THE FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES I HAD TO TAKE IT OFF CRUISE - AS IT WASN'T SAFE IN ANY WAY. THE LAST TIME I SET IT WELL BELOW THE DESIRED SPEED WITH NO OTHER VEHICLES IN VIEW SO THAT I COULD TRY TO ALLOW IT TO RUN ITS COMPLETE CYCLE. I WANTED TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF ALLOWED TO RUN ITS COURSE.  WHEN I SET THE CRUISE CONTROL, IT SETS FINE. THEN, WHEN I GO DOWN A VERY SLIGHT DOWNHILL, THE ENGINE REVS WILDLY UP TO 4000 RPM, HANGS THERE FOR A LONG WHILE AND PULLS THE CAR UP WELL OVER THE SET SPEED. THEN IT DROPS, INEXPLICABLY, TO APPROX. 3000 RPM, HANGS FOR A BIT, AND THEN DROPS DOWN TO WHERE IT SHOULD BE - APPROXIMATELY 1000 -1500 RPM AND THE SPEED GOES BACK TO NORMAL.  WHAT GOOD IS A CRUISE CONTROL IF YOU NEED TO BABYSIT IT? YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF BECAUSE IT'S ACCELERATING RAPIDLY OUT OF CONTROL!   I READ SOMEONE'S ACCOUNT OF THEIR CAR ACCELERATING UNTIL THEY CAME UP BEHIND SOMEONE ELSE, THE CAR BRAKES CAME ON, AND THEY WERE NEARLY REAR-ENDED BY THE PERSON BEHIND THEM BECAUSE OF THE SUDDEN BRAKING. IT SOUNDS LIKE A TICKING TIME BOMB!
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2019 TOYOTA COROLLA. THE CONTACT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBERS: 20V012000 (FUEL SYSTEM, GASOLINE) AND 20V024000 (AIR BAGS) HOWEVER, THE PARTS TO DO THE RECALL REPAIRS WERE NOT YET AVAILABLE.

VIN TOOL CONFIRMS PARTS NOT AVAILABLE.*BF*JB
WHEN CRUISE CONTROL IS ENGAGED AND THE VEHICLE IS TRAVELING DOWN AN INCLINE IT WILL ACCELERATE 5-10 MPH OVER WHAT THE CRUISE CONTROL IS SET AT. FOR EXAMPLE IF I HAVE IT SET AT 65 MPH IT WILL ACCELERATE TO 75-80 MPH ON IT'S OWN. I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN FOR THIS TWICE NOW AND TOYOTA CAN NOT FIGURE OUT WHY IT IS HAPPENING. THE RPM'S WILL GET UP TO 4000 AND ONCE THE VEHICLE IS LEVELED OUT AGAIN ON A FLAT ROUTE IT HARD BREAKS TO SLOW THE VEHICLE DOWN.
I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM TOYOTA STATING THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE CVT AND THAT IT COULD FAIL. UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS IT COULD CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO LOSE POWER, ESPECIALLY AT HIGHER SPEEDS. I HAVE CONTACTED THEM AND THERE IS NO RESOLUTION AS YET. I FEEL EXTREMELY UNSAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE, I WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE ADDRESSED WHEN I TOOK THE CAR IN FOR THE 5000 MILE SERVICE BUT I WAS GIVEN ERRONEOUS INFORMATION. I DON'T THINK I SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN IN ORDER TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. IF A REMEDY IS NOT AVAILABLE THEN I SHOULD BE AFFORDED A LONER UNTIL SUCH TIME WHEN TOYOTA COMES UP WITH A FIX.

The anti-lock brake system (ABS) malfunctioned when the vehicle was still very new, with only 25,000 miles. Diagnostics from two independent service centers confirmed that the ABS electronic control unit is failing due to an external failure. Both specialists stated that such a failure is highly uncommon and is a clear quality issue related to the electronic components. A critical system like ABS should not fail this early, raising serious concerns about the durability and reliability of the vehicle’s braking system.
I have a 2020 Toyota Corolla. "Engine Maintenance Required; Visit Your Dealer" came on the display after I brought my car to the dealership. I returned to the dealership and was told it was $250 to diagnose the problem. I waited a month later and brought my car back for an 80,000 inspection at the Longo Toyota in Prosper Texas. They diagnosed the problem this time and said they would have to replace the Coolant Bypass Valve and Hose for ~$800 plus labor costs. The risk of not repairing these parts is possible engine failure or fire. I've seen many other discussion forums where people are experiencing the same problem with Rav4, Corolla, and Camry models 2020-2023. These parts are not covered under warranty and would have to pay out of pocket for the repairs. Toyota should issue a recall since many people are reporting these same issues, creating out-of-pocket costs for the repairs for >$800.
Engine coolant Bypass Valve issue
The engine coolant bypass valve is coming up as a code. Around 44k miles. Others have had this problem.
Check engine light is giving a false positive. There is something wrong with the coolant bypass valve. I checked online and this is not an isolated event.
Dashboard stated engine maintenance required- visit your dealer and it turned out to be a bypass coolant valve malfunction per Toyota mechanic specialists.
The system belt sensor kept beeping even though I have on seat belt
Coolant bypass valve problem. Engine maintenance required light has come on. This part affects several other components of the vehicle. Toyota dealership wants to charge $800 to fix it. It is a very common issue faced by many customers of 2020+ Corollas and 2019+ Rav4s. All dealerships with service departments are aware of this issue.
Battery and alternator died causing power steering to fail and wheels to lock up. Should not happen on a car this new, brought to dealer and charged me $740 to fix it.
The contact owns a 2020 Toyota Corolla. The contact stated while driving 60 MPH, the steering wheel became difficult to turn. The contact stated that the check engine warning light was illuminated. The vehicle was towed to a local dealer where it was diagnosed with needing a steering shaft replaced however, the vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was informed of the failure but provided no assistance. The failure mileage was approximately 12,000.
EVERY TIME IT RAINS THE DOORS GETS FILLED UP WITH WATER FROM THE RAINFALL
IN AN EMPTY PARKING LOT AROUND NOONTIME ON A SUNNY DAY, I WAS TRYING TO PARK MY CAR.  THE CAR WAS IN DRIVE FORWARD MODE. I FULLY STOPPED FOR PARKING THE CAR; I HAD TO BACKUP A LITTLE BIT. AFTER FULL STOP (TO PROTECT MY TRANSMISSION), I MOVED THE GEAR STICK FROM DRIVE TO REVERSE AND DRIVE STICK WAS SHOWING ME, I AM IN REVERSE, BUT THE CAR INSTEAD OF GOING BACK, STARTED MOVING FORWARD. FORTUNATELY, THE PARKING LOT WAS EMPTY AND NOBODY GOT HURT, OTHERWISE THIS WOULD HAVE SERIOUSLY INJURED SOMEBODY IN FRONT OF THE CAR. HOWEVER, WHEN I MOVED THE DRIVE STICK FROM DRIVE TO PARK AND THEN COME BACK TO REVERSE THIS DID NOT HAPPEN.  I STARTED SEARCHING IN INTERNET WHETHER ANYBODY ELSE HAS EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM. I FOUND OUT THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM AND FOR FIXING THE PROBLEM WHAT THEY HAD TO DO HAD TO UPDATE THE CAR'S COMPUTER SOFTWARE, OTHERWISE IF ONE AFTER FULL STOP GOES FROM DRIVE DIRECTLY TO REVERSE, THE CAR MIGHT START GOING FORWARD. THIS PROBLEM, WITHOUT SOFTWARE UPDATE CAN HAPPEN ONLY IN CERTAIN BATCH OF THE CARS. SO MAKE SURE YOU TEST YOUR CAR AND IF YOU HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM, DO NOT DRIVE THE CAR AND TAKE IT BACK TO THE DEALER FOR SOFTWARE UPDATE.  *BF  CONSUMER STATED IT RECURRED SEVERAL TIMES.*JB
I turned on the vehicle and an Engine Maintenance Required light and warning went off on my car. I noticed the warning would only come up once I turned on the A/C so I presumed it was an issue with the Coolant Bypass Valve
Coolant bypass valve has failed. AutoNation  Toyota in Cerritos has verified issue. This issue has caused potential engine overheating, engine maintenance required warning light has popped up in my vehicle, was told by AutoNation that my vehicle is not covered for this repair and I will have to pay out of pocket.
After buying the car I got an email from car fax that my car has a recall on it.  The recall says: PASSENGER AIRBAG MAY NOT DEPLOY The date of the recall is: 12/20/23 I bought the car on 08/10/24  NHTSA: #23V865  I called my local Toyota dealership multiple times and they say the recall is not available yet.
Engine coolant bypass valve malfunctioned at 34xxx miles, causing “engine maintenance required” this could cause the engine to get too hot or not hot enough and affect the internal components of the engine. After speaking to others with the same model and even other models, it seems to be a ongoing issue for many people.
After x amount of miles a random service light will come on that states “engine maintenance required, visit your dealer “. It’s nerve racking for your every day drivers.
I was rear-ended by a large truck F250 estimated speed 20 25 miles an hour no airbags deployed at all was enough to injure my neck and back
The contact owns a 2021 Toyota Corolla. The contact stated while driving 30 MPH, the parking brake warning light illuminated. The contact was able to continue driving. The contact stated that the failure had been reoccurring while driving. Additionally, the brake warning light was illuminated. The dealer was notified of the failure and advised the contact to take the vehicle for diagnostic testing. The vehicle was taken to the dealer. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 10,800.
WHEN I PARKED MY CAR THE MORNING ON MARCH 22, THE TEMPERATURE WAS AROUND 50F.  THERE WAS NO WINDSHIELD CRACK AT THIS TIME.   WHEN I WENT TO GET MY CAR IN THE AFTERNOON ON MARCH 22, A FOOT LONG CRACK HAD FORMED ON MY WINDSHIELD.    THE TEMPERATURE AT THIS TIME WAS AROUND 70F.      HAD THIS HAPPENED WHILE I DROVE, IT WOULD HAD BEEN A SAFETY HAZARD.    A WINDSHIELD SHOULD NOT CRACK THIS FAST. A FOOT LONG ON THE FIRST DAY?  THE CAR WASN'T EVEN MOVING WHEN THIS HAPPENED.  IMAGINE HOW FAST THE CRACK WOULD CRACK IF THE CAR WAS MOVING.    THE CAR HAD LESS THAN 500 MILES AND WAS LESS THAN A MONTH OLD WHEN THIS OCCURRED.
Collant bypass valve premature failure at 35K
Rear USB port was not working properly. Very first time an apple USB cable connected,  it overheats and smokes and cable melts.  Tried a second apple cable its also burnt.  At the dealership tech  reported high power output at the USB port.  Dealer replaced USB port under warranty.
Vehicle's cruise control got stuck and would not turn off by the brake, the cruise control off button. The only way it would shut off is by swtitching the car into “B-(Low Gear/Engine Braking). Was cruising at 70 mph, and then the cruise control kept speeding the vehicle up to 100 mph, until I switched it into the “B”-(Low Gear/Engine Braking). Now if I wasn’t familiar with this type of car this could have been a tragedy that could have taken place on August 01, 2022.
The contact owns a 2010 Honda Civic. The contact stated that the front driver's side seat belt failed to be unlatch. After several attempts, the contact was able to unlatch the seat belt. The contact stated that the front driver's side seat belt had previously been replaced twice; however, the failure recurred. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 65,200.

TAKATA RECALL  A ACCIDENT BUT AIRBAG DIDN'T USE, AND THEN I REPAIRED THE CAR, REPLACED THE DOOR. YESTERDAY I WENT TO DEALER TO SELL MY CAR, THEY TOLD ME THIS PROBLEM, BUT IT IS NOT MINE, THE VEHICLE SHOULD BE RECALLED, AND MY ELECTRONIC CONTROL SYSTEM, VEHICULAR AUDIO SYSTEM CABLE DOESN'T WORK TOO. MY FRIEND WAS INJURED AND WENT TO EMERGENCY ROOM, IT COSTED THOUSAND OF DOLLARS.

THE PAINT HAS BEEN PEELING OFF THE HOOD,TRUNK AND ROOF OF CAR  PROGRESSIVELY FOR PAST FEW YEARS. I HAVE SEEN MANY OTHER HONDA CIVICS WITH SIMILAR ISSUE AND VERY SURPRISED THERE IS NOT A RECALL ON THIS.
I WONDER WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO RECALL MY CAR BECAUSE OF THE TAKATA RECALL.  I AM SCARED EVERY TIME I DRIVE THAT SOMEONE MIGHT HIT ME AND THE AIR BAG EXPLODE.  WHEN I CALL THEM, THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT RECALLING MY YEAR.  WHY NOT?  IF IT IS DEFECTIVE, IT SHOULD BE RECALLED.
TL* TAKATA RECALL. THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 HONDA CIVIC. THE CONTACT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 16V346000 (AIR BAGS); HOWEVER, THE PART TO DO THE REPAIR WAS NOT YET AVAILABLE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE MANUFACTURER EXCEEDED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THE RECALL REPAIR. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE ISSUE. THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE. VIN TOOL CONFIRMS PARTS NOT AVAILABLE.
I RECEIVED A RECALL LATTER ON FRIDAY JULY 22, 2016. I CALLED AMERICA HONDA FOR REPAIR, BUT I WAS TOLD NO PARTS AVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT AND TO CALL HONDA DEALER FOR SERVICE, ON MONDAY JULY 24, 2016 I CALLED HONDA DEALER FOR SERVICE ON THE RECALL AIRBAG, BUT THEY TOLD ME NO PARTS AVAILABLE AT THIS MOMENT. ALSO THEY TOLD ME NOT HAVE A PASSENGER IN THE CAR. BECAUSE IF IN AN INCIDENT AND THE AIRBAG DEPLOY THEY'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGED OR INJURIES.  I HAVE NOT USED MY 2010 HONDA CIVIC SINCE JULY 24, 2010 DUE TO UNSAFE REASON AND DANGER FOR MY FAMILY. I STILL OWE FOR MY 2010 HONDA CIVIC AND DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY AMERICA HONDA DOESN'T HURRY UP AND REPAIR THE DEFECTED AIRBAGS (TAKATA RECALL). I USE MY 2010 HONDA CIVIC TO TAKE MY FAMILY TO SCHOOL, PARK, STORE, DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS, DENTAL APPOINTMENTS, AND VISIT FAMILIES, AND NOT TO MENTION MY WORK. THIS REPAIR DELAY CAUSING ME STRESS, PROBLEM GETTING TO WORK AND PLACES'. MY WIFE AND I STOP ATTENDING CERRITOS COLLEGE DUE TO TAKATA RECALL, BECAUSE IT'S UNSAFE AND DANGEROUS FOR MY FAMILY TO USE THE PASSENGER SEAT.  MY FAMILY SHOULD NOT PAY THE PRICE FOR ANY DEFECTED PARTS OR MALFUNCTION SAFETY EQUIPMENT. ON TOP OF THAT, WHY SHOULD I PAY MY 2010 HONDA CIVIC MONTHLY PAYMENT IF I'M NOT USING THE VEHICLE, DUE TO HONDA UNSAFE AND DANGEROUS SAFETY EQUIPMENT ( TAKATA RECALL).
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 HONDA CIVIC. WHILE DRIVING VARIOUS SPEEDS, THE SUN VISOR WOULD NOT REMAIN IN PLACE AND FELL CONTINUOUSLY. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE INNER PART WAS FRACTURED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS  NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 65,000.  UPDATED 09/30/16*LJ    *CN
WE HAVE REPLACED THE SUN VISOR IN THE SECOND YEAR THAT WE HAD THE CAR. OUR CAR IS NOW SIX YEARS OLD AND IT HAS TO BE REPLACED AGAIN! MY SON HAS A 2002 HONDA AND HAS NEVER HAD TO REPLACE THEM. IT MAKES ME FEEL THE CAR IS MADE VERY CHEAPLY!
WHEN I START THE CAR IT RUMBLES AND THE RPMS REV UP. I KNOW IT IS THE WIRES THAT GO FROM THE IGNITION COILS TO THE ENGINE THAT IS CAUSING THE PROBLEMS BUT.. YOU CANT BUY THAT PART AT AN AUTO PART STORE BC THE WIRE HARNESS IS NOT PATENTED.. TO GO TO HONDA ITS $793. SINCE IVE ONLY HAD THE CAR I HAVE ONLY PUT 50K MLES ON IT. THIS IS RIDICULOUS THAT IM HAVING THIS MAJOR OF AN ISSUE THIS SOON.
DRIVER SIDE SUN VISOR BROKE BY SIMPLY PULLING DOWN THE VISOR TO SHIELD MY EYES AT 55MPH. IT NOW JUST HANGS HALFWAY DOWN AND WILL NOT STAY UP AGAINST THE ROOF AREA. I HAVE READ THAT HONDA HAS HAD ISSUES IN THE PAST WITH THEIR VISORS BUT ONLY FIXING UP TO 2009 AND MINE IS A 2010. THIS IS A BIT DANGEROUS. *TR
RIDES ROUGH SHAKES FEELS THAT IT'S GOING TO STALL.  VERY OBVIOUS WHEN STOPPING FOR RED LIGHTS.  VIBRATION OCCURS  IF I PUT THE TRANSMISSION IN NEUTRAL.  SOMETIMES IT STOPS IT BUT IT DOES REOCCUR.  ALSO THE A/C MAKES THE CAR  VIBRATE EVEN MORE.  WAS SERVICED HOWEVER HAD TO BRING IT BACK, PAYING $160. , IN AUGUST 2012 FOR THE SAME  PROBLEM.  THEY TOOK IT FOR A RIDE FELT SOMETHING IN THE STEERING WHEEL AND PROCEEDED TO REALIGN FRONT WHEELS.  RODE WITH A MEMBER OF THE SERVICE DEPT FOR A GOOD 20 MINUTES AND NOTHING HAPPENED TO THE CAR.  WHEN I  DROVE THE CAR HOME IT HAPPENED AGAIN AND, TO DATE, IT IS STILL HAPPENING.    A MEMBER OF THE SERVICE DEPT TOLD ME IN CONFIDENCE THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ENGINE AND THE A/C  BUT THEY HAVEN'T FOUND HOW TO FIX IT.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF OTHER CIVICS COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.   *JS
THE DRIVERS SIDE SUN VISOR WAS NOT STAYING IN PLACE FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS. YESTERDAY, WHEN I TRIED TO ADJUST IT, THE WHOLE THING CAME RIGHT OFF. THE VISOR SPLIT OPEN AND A BUNCH OF LITTLE PLASTIC PIECES INSIDE WERE BROKEN. I TOOK IT TO THE MECHANIC AND THE PART COSTS $45 AND LUCKILY I'M NOT BEING CHARGED A SERVICE FEE. I WANTED TO REPORT THIS BECAUSE I HAVE READ A LOT ABOUT IT ONLINE AND IT'S NOT FAIR THAT THE MANUFACTURER USES SUCH CHEAP PARTS THAT WILL MELT OR BREAK.  *TR
THERE HAVE BEEN THREE (3) FRONT END COLLISIONS ON THIS VEHICLE.  2 WERE DEER RELATED. THE FIRST ACCIDENT WAS A DEER HIT, AT 60 MPH., BODY SHOP SAID BECAUSE THE DEER HIT DIRECTLY IN THE CENTER OF THE FRONT OF THE CAR, AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.  THE SECOND ACCIDENT IN NOVEMBER OF 2012, DAUGHTER WAS TRAVELING 69 MPH ON THE INTERSTATE AND SWERVED TO AVOID HITTING A DEER.  SHE TRAVELED APPROXIMATELY 300 FEET DOWN A DITCH AND BACK UP THE OTHER SIDE, STRIKING AN EMBANKMENT, COMING TO REST 2 FEET FROM ONCOMING TRAFFIC ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE INTERSTATE.  THE VIRGINIA STATE POLICE OFFICER SAID AT THE TIME, HE COULDN'T BELIEVE THE AIRBAG DIDN'T DEPLOY. THE FRONT END OF THE CAR WAS TOTALLY DISENGAGED FROM THE CAR. THE LAST ACCIDENT, JUNE 2013, YOUNGER DAUGHTER WAS INVOLVED IN A 3 CAR ACCIDENT.  SHE REAR ENDED THE CAR AHEAD OF HER WHO HAD REAR ENDED THE CAR AHEAD OF IT.  WET ROADS WERE A FACTOR, HOWEVER, THIS WAS AGAIN A FRONT END COLLISION, WITH A SPEED OF 40+ MPH. WHILE WE ARE VERY THANKFUL THAT NO ONE WAS INJURED IN ANY OF THESE ACCIDENTS, IT'S CERTAIN THE AIRBAG IN THIS VEHICLE DOES NOT WORK. *TR
I HAVE A 2010 HONDA CIVIC THAT I LEASED IN MAY OF 2010. IT IS NOW JANUARY 3, 2013 AND I HAVE CHANGED THE BRAKES 3 TIMES ALREADY. THERE IS DEFINITELY A PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES WEARING TOO IMMATURELY.  *TR
PURCHASED CAR NEW FROM HONDA DEALERSHIP.  FRONT BRAKE PADS REPLACED THE FIRST TIME AT APPROXIMATELY 15000 ALONG WITH A FAULTY CALIPER, THEY WERE REPLACED AGAIN IN APPROXIMATELY 30000 MILES (6 MONTHS LATER).  NOW THE WHEEL ALIGNMENT IS COMPLETELY OFF AT JUST AROUND JUST OVER 34000 MILES.  THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS RELATED TO THE BRAKE PROBLEM WITH THIS YEAR VEHICLE AS WELL AS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OUT OF CALIFORNIA.  DOING SOME RESEARCH, I FOUND OUT THAT THERE VERY WELL COULD BE A LINK BETWEEN THE ALIGNMENT PROBLEM AND THE BRAKES.    *JS
I HAVE A 2010 HONDA CIVIC THAT I PURCHASE IN OCT OF 2009 THAT IS GOING THROUGH BRAKES PREMATURELY.  THERE MUST BE SOME SORT OF DEFECT WITH THE CIVIC'S BRAKING SYSTEM.      ON NOVEMBER 30TH ON 2010, I BROUGHT MY CAR INTO SCOTT ROBINSON HONDA IN TORRANCE, CA BECAUSE MY BREAKS WERE SQUEAKING.  I WAS CERTAIN THAT AFTER ONLY 13 MONTHS AND 12,457 MILES THERE MUST BE SOME SORT OF DEFECT AND THAT MY WARRANTY WOULD COVER THE COST OF ANY REPAIRS.  WRONG.  I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE REP THAT I NEEDED TO REPLACE MY BRAKE PADS AND THAT THE WARRANTY WOULD NOT COVER THE COST BECAUSE THE PADS WERE WORN EVENLY AND IT APPEARED TO BE "NORMAL" WEAR AND TEAR.  I TOLD HIM THAT I HAVE HAD HONDA'S FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS AND HAVE NEVER HAD TO REPLACE BREAK PADS BEFORE 25,000-30,000 MILES.  HE SIMPLY SHOOK HIS HEAD AND GENTLY INSINUATED THAT IT MAY BE DUE TO MY DRIVING HABITS OR THE FACT THAT I LIVE ON A HILL.  I PAID THEM $196.59 TO REPLACE THE BRAKE PADS.    ON OCTOBER 31ST 2011, I BROUGHT MY CAR INTO SCOTT ROBINSON HONDA AGAIN FOR A PROBLEM I HAD BEEN HAVING WITH THE POWER DOOR LOCKS (LUCKILY, THIS PROBLEM WAS COVERED UNDER WARRANTY).  WHEN THE REP CAME OUT TO UPDATE ME ON THE STATUS, HE INFORMED ME THAT I HAD VERY LITTLE LEFT TO MY BRAKE PADS.  I WAS SHOCKED AND OF COURSE LOOKED AT THE MAN LIKE HE HAD FOUR HEADS.  I TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS ONLY A YEAR AND LESS THAN 11,000 MILES (10,993 MILES TO BE EXACT) SINCE I LAST HAD THE PADS REPLACED.  ONCE AGAIN, I WAS MET WITH THE SYMPATHY OF A REP SHAKING HIS HEAD AND A "SOMETIMES THAT HAPPENS" COMMENT.    I HAVE ALWAYS SWORN BY HONDA VEHICLES, BUT IF I HAVE TO LAY OUT 200 BUCKS FOR NEW BRAKE PADS EVERY 11,000 MILES, I WILL NOT PURCHASE ANOTHER ONE IN THE FUTURE.  I FEEL THAT THIS PROBLEM REALLY NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER AND THAT HONDA SHOULD RECALL AND MAKE THE NECESSARY REPAIRS.  *TR
WITH LESS THAN 12,000 MILES ON MY CAR, MY BRAKE PADS NEED TO BE REPLACED. I WOULD HAVE NEVER EXPECTED MY CAR TO NEED NEW BRAKES THIS EARLY, SO I ALMOST DIDN'T TAKE MY CAR IN WHEN IT WAS MAKING A NOISE. I INSPECTED MY CAR TO SEE IF SOMETHING AS STUCK IN THE TIRES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND AM SHOCKED TO FIND OUT MY BRAKES ARE ALREADY WORN. AFTER MUCH RESEARCH ONLINE, I SEE THAT THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE FOR HONDAS. *TR
TL*THE CONTACT OWNS A 2007 HONDA CIVIC. WHILE DRIVING AT APPROXIMATELY 70 MPH, THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY STALLED. THE CONTACT PULLED OVER AND REMOVED THE OIL CAP. SMOKE BEGAN TO COME OUT OF THE OIL COMPARTMENT AND THE DIP STICK WAS MELTED. THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT RESTART AND WAS TOWED TO AN AUTHORIZED DEALERSHIP WHERE THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED THAT THE MOTOR BLOCK WAS CRACKED. THE VEHICLE HAD NOT BEEN REPAIRED AT THE TIME OF THE COMPLAINT. THE CURRENT AND FAILURE MILEAGES WERE APPROXIMATELY 88,000.
HI I AM [XXX] AND I WAS THE PASSENGER IN A CAR ACCIDENT ON APRIL 3RD, 2020. THE DRIVER WAS [XXX] AND WE WE'RE HEADED HOME DOWN 184/CONERROSS CREEK ROAD AND WE CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP AT A FOUR WAY STOP SIGN. [XXX] LOOKED LEFT AND SEEN A VEHICLE APPROACHING THE FOUR WAY AND [XXX] THEN LOOKED RIGHT AN HE LOOKED STRAIGHT AND THEN BEGAN TO LET OFF THE BREAK PEDAL AND THEN WE GOT HIT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE NEAR THE HEADLIGHT AREA. IT IS TOTALED. WHEN WE GOT HIT THE PASSENGER AIR BAGS WE HAD REPLACED FOR A RECALL ABOUT A YEAR AGO. MY HEAD CRACKED THE WINDSHIELD, MY CHEST HIT THE DASH WHICH CAUSED A BROKEN STERNUM AND TWO DISPLACED DISC. THE PASSENGER AIR BAG CAME OUT LATE, THE TWO PASSENGER SIDE CURTAIN AIRBAGS ALSO DIDN'T DEPLOY. I HAVE ALL THE DOCUMENTATION.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR
WHILE DRIVING I REACHED UP TO PULL THE DRIVER SIDE VISOR DOWN TO BLOCK THE SUN GLARE. AS THE VISOR CAME DOWN IT MADE A CRACKING  SOUND. AFTER STOPPING AND PLACING VISOR BACK    UP AN IN PLACE. I LEARNED IT HAD BROKE ON THE FIRST USE. NOW THE VISOR WILL NOT STAY IN PLACE AND SOMETIMES SWINGS AND RESTRAINS MY VIEW AS A DRIVER. THIS IS A ODD OCCURENCE, OR A DETECTED PRODUCT.
TAKATA RECALL - MY RECALL LOOKUP SAYS REMEDY IS NOT YET AVAILABLE, BUT THE INITIAL ESTIMATES SAY I SHOULD EXPECT A RECALL IN LATE SUMMER/FALL OF 2016. IF A REMEDY IS NOT AVAILABLE IN A TIMELY MANNER, THE LOOKUP SAYS TO FILE A COMPLAINT.
TAKATA RECALL:  I AM TRYING TO DETERMINE WHETHER I NEED TO TAKE MY 2011 HONDA CIVIC SEDAN IN TO CHECK THE AIR BAGS AND POSSIBLY REPLACE THEM. I THOUGHT THE MOST RECENT RECALL NOTICES CITED THE HONDA CIVIC 2011 PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG AS A POTENTIAL PROBLEM. I HAVE NOT HAD ANY ACCIDENTS OR MALFUNCTIONS SO FAR, BUT I AM VERY CONCERNED.
DRIVER'S SEATBELT DOES NOT RETRACT CORRECTLY WHEN I TAKE IT OFF. HANGS EXTREMELY LOOSE INTO DOOR WELL AND HAS TO BE SLOWLY AND MANUALLY RETRACTED INTO UPPER RETRACTION UNIT. I AM NOT VERY COMFORTABLE OR SURE IT IS OPERATING CORRECTLY IN THE CASE OF AN ACCIDENT.     DEALER (KUHN HONDA IN TAMPA, FL) SAYS THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. BUT IF THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT, WHY DOES IT NOT RETRACT AND HANG SO LOOSELY IN THE DOORWAY? NO OTHER CAR I HAVE EVER DRIVEN, HAS HAD A SEATBELT SO VERY LOOSE.     I HAVE SPOKEN TO AMERICAN HONDA, AND THEY DO NOT WANT TO ADMIT THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR, AND TO MAKE THINGS WORSE, THE CAR IS UNDER WARRANTY.  *TR
THE FRONT BRAKES ON MY HONDA CIVIC HAD TO BE REPLACED THE FIRST TIME AT 17,000 MILES. IT HAD FAILED RIGHT AT THE END OF THE HONDA 1 YEAR WARRANTY (THE FIRST DATE IS ESTIMATED BUT I CAN DIG IT OUT FROM THE HONDA DEALER IF THIS BECOMES AN ISSUE)  I HAVE ONLY THE ESTIMATED FIRST DATE. I THOUGHT THIS WAS A FLUKE AND HONDA COVERED IT UNDER WARRANTY SO I DIDN'T THINK MUCH ABOUT IT. HOWEVER, MY NEXT SET OF BRAKES FAILED AT 15,000 MILES. THE ACTUAL DATE WAS 7/8/2013 ON THIS FAILURE. AGAIN THEY HAVE WARANTIED THE BRAKES.  I AM ON MY 3RD SET OF BRAKES AND THE CAR HAS NOT EVEN HIT 40-50,000 MILES. THAT IS IF MY BRAKES WERE BEING RIDDEN HARD. AT SOME POINT I AM CONCERNED THAT HONDA WILL NOT FIX THE PROBLEM THAT APPEARS TO BE WELL KNOWN. THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR BRAKING SYSTEM ON THE HONDA CIVICS. IT APPEARS THEY ARE NOT RECALLING THIS AND ARE LEAVING PEOPLE TWISTING IN THE WIND. I DON'T KNOW OF A MORE CRITICAL COMPONENT TO A VEHICLES SAFETY THAN THE BRAKING SYSTEM. IT CAN HARM BOTH DRIVER, PEDESTRIAN OR OTHER MOTORISTS AND CAUSE A FINANCIAL CALAMITY TO BOTH DRIVER AND OTHER PARTIES. PLEASE MAKE HONDA FIGURE OUT THIS PROBLEM AND PROVIDE A SOLUTION SO THAT WE CAN DRIVE A SAFE CAR. THERE IS A LAWSUIT FOR THIS KNOWN PROBLEM WITH HONDA, I PREFER NOT TO GET INVOLVED INTO THIS BUT RATHER HAVE THEM FIX THIS PROBLEM. OTHER THAN THAT IT HAS BEEN A GOOD VEHICLE. I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A FINANCIAL REWARD I JUST WANT MY CAR FIXED AND PROPERLY ENGINEERED SO THAT THE BRAKES WON'T FAIL PREMATURELY. IT CAN BE COSTLY IF I HAVE TO REPLACE MY BRAKES ONCE A YEAR.  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HONDA CIVIC. THE CONTACT WAS DRIVING 10 MPH AND ATTEMPTING A TURN WHEN THE VEHICLE STALLED AND SLIPPED OUT OF GEAR. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE GEAR ENGAGED BACK INTO THE CORRECT POSITION INDEPENDENTLY. THE CONTACT TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER FOR A DIAGNOSTIC TEST WHERE THE DEALER ADVISED THAT THE TRANSMISSION SLIPPING WAS A COMMON FAILURE, BUT ADVISED THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS OPERATING NORMALLY. THE DEALER STATED THAT THE SLIPPING WOULD OCCUR BECAUSE THE TRANSMISSION ASSUMED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS STOPPING. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 8,500.
2011 HONDA CIVIC WITH 4000 MILES. TOOK IT TO DEALERSHIP FOR AN OIL CHANGE AND COMPLAINED ABOUT A BURNED SMELL WHEN BRAKING WHILE DRIVING UPHILL AFTER THE CAR STOPS. NO HEAVY BRAKING THOUGH. DEALERSHIP INSPECTED THE BRAKES AND SAID EVERYTHING WAS FINE. AT 7300 MILES AND A TOTAL OF 7 MONTHS OF USE THE CAR STARTED TO MAKE A GRINDING NOISE WHEN BRAKING OR NOT. TOOK TO DEALER AND THEY SAID MY BRAKE PADS HAD ZERO % LEFT, METAL TO METAL. THEY BLAMED THE WAY THE CAR WAS BEING DRIVEN AND TREATED ME LIKE I WAS SOME JERK THAT WAS DRAG RACING EVERY DAY AND TOASTED THE BRAKES. I PREVIOUSLY HAD A 2007 TOYOTA CAMRY THAT I DROVE THE SAME WAY (AS A NORMAL PERSON BY THE WAY, CITY AND FREEWAY) AND DID NOT HAVE TO REPLACE BRAKES UNTIL OVER 33000 MILES! THIS IS RIDICULOUS, EVEN A VERY BAD DRIVER THAT KEEPS HITTING HIS BRAKES SHOULD NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM WITH 7300 MILES IN A COMPACT CAR. HONDA DECLINED ANY SERVICING AND DECLINED TO FIX OR EVEN LOOK DEEPER FOR A POSSIBLE PROBLEM. WANTED TO CHARGE ME OVER $100 FOR A 5 MINUTE BRAKE PAD INSPECTION... A JOKE!  *TT
This is a serious matter that needs to be evaluated as it is a potentially fatal safety issue for human drivers of 2012 Honda Civic. This email needs to be sent please to the Department of Transportation and the National Transportation Safety Board for evaluation of extension of recall: meaning other 2012 Honda Civic vehicles that have the same type or similar area of issues as the two above stated recalls and from the same manufacturer as the 2012 Honda Civic vehicles but whose VIN were not included in the group of VIN numbers in the original recalls) a. 2019 - control arm bushings cracked - cause: leaking - front lower arm compliance bushings, both replaced by Honda( documention available upon request) b. 2019- right front tire shred and upon inspection by Goodyear no nail or issue could be found for the one right front tire shredding. (documentation and images available upon request) c. 2022- right front tire shreds while driving and upon inspection by Goodyear no nail or issue could be found for the right front tire behavior. (documentation and images available upon request) d. 2024-right front control arm mount and right control arm failure while driving causing the vehicle to be a total loss including from collateral damage. It happened at a low speed but if it happened at a higher speed it would have been potentially fatal. Corporate American Honda made aware and Corporate American Honda made aware this is to be reported to the Department of Transportation and Corporate American Honda response was that they were taking no action to the situation of the request for evaluation of extension of recall, besides just collecting the information I was reporting to them due per Corporate American Honda to it potentially costing Corporate Honda money and that they American Corporate Honda were willing to wait the couple of months that it could potentially take for the Department of Transportation to evaluate. Police report was taken, but I do not have a copy.
While driving at about 40 mph the car suddenly started to pull toward the left. I pressed on the brake pedal as I steered to the right to try to bring the car back to my lane but I noticed the brake pedal was already very hard. In a second the car skidded out of control toward the right side of the road and it slammed its left side against some big rocks. The driver's door window broke and the side airbags deployed. The big rocks kept us from going into the water of a lake that the road runs next to. The passengers in the car were myself and my wife and were not injured but it was a very terrifying incident and the consequences could have been a lot worse. The vehicle has been released to Progressive, the Insurance Company.

HE SAID THEY WERE INCAPABLE OF FIXING IT.  THIS ISSUE BECAME PROGRESSIVELY WORSE OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD.
ON OCT. 24 AND 25, 2018, A MESSAGE "AIRBAG SYSTEM" SUDDENLY APPEARED ON MY DASHBOARD. ON OCT. 25, 2018, I TOOK THE CAR TO ROBERTSON HONDA WERE THEY DETERMINED THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE AIRBAG SYSTEM. I WAS ASKED IF MY CAR WAS EVER INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT AND I SAID NO. HE INFORMED ME THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR FIXING THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE WARRANTY HAD ALREADY EXPIRED. WHEN I PROTESTED, HE SAID HE WOULD CHECK WITH HIS SUPERVISOR AND WHEN HE CAME BACK HE SAID THEY WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM BUT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY $90.00. I DIDN'T TAMPER WITH THE AIRBAG SYSTEM SO HONDA SHOULD ABSORB THE COSTS,. I CALLED HONDA CORPORATE OFFICE AND WAS TOLD THAT  BECAUSE MY CAR WAS NOT ON THE LIST OF RECALL, AND THE WARRANTY HAD ALREADY EXPIRED, I WOULD HAVE TO PAY THE SAID AMOUNT. ARE THEY RIGHT?

WAS DRIVING AROUND 50 MPH WHEN THE LIGHT CHANGED  TO YELLOW, WHEN I TRIED TO PUT ON BRAKES THEY WERE GONE AND THE STEERING WAS GONE ALSO, I DID SEE A ERROR MESSAGE THAT STATED TO CHECK POWER STEERING I WAS ABLE TO TURN THE CAR INTO A PARKING LOT INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH THE LIGHT.  I CUT OFF THE CAR AND RE-STARTED THE CAR AND THE MESSAGE AND THE CHECK STEERING LIGHT WERE GONE.  IT WAS AS IF THE CAR LOST POWER.  I PUT MY VIN IN HONDA'S WEB SITE TO CHECK FOR A RECALL AND THERE WERE NOT ANY.  THIS COULD CAUSE FATAL ACCIDENTS.  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 HONDA CIVIC. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE AT A STOP, ANOTHER VEHICLE CRASHED INTO THE DRIVER SIDE OF THE CONTACT'S VEHICLE. THE CONTACT SUSTAINED A LACERATION TO THE RIGHT LEG AND MULTIPLE FRACTURES TO THE PELVIS WHICH REQUIRED MEDICAL ATTENTION.

PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS AS I DID A WEB SEARCH AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS, NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS FOR THE SAME ISSUE. MY CONCERN IS MY WIFE DRIVES ALONE AND SHE HAS HAD TO BE JUMP STARTED BY STRANGERS SEVERAL TIMES.  HERE IS THE ISSUE, WHICH AGAIN IS ALL OVER THE INTERNET.   THE CAR BATTERY WILL DIE FOR NO APPARENT REASON. THE ANSWER HAS BEEN TO GET A NEW BATTERY.  HOWEVER, IT ONLY SOLVES THE PROBLEM FOR A SHORT WHILE.   *TR
MOST OF TIMES THE PASSENGER IN THE FRONT SEAT MOVES A LITTLE BIT, THE AIR BAG IS TURNED OFF. AND I GET A BIG NOTICE SAYING THE PASSENGER AIR BAG IS TURNED OFF. THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM AND IS VERY SCARY IN MOST SITUATIONS OF FAILURE OF SAFETY . I CALLED SEVERAL TIMES  &  TALK TO SERVICE WRITER THEY JUST TOLD ME THAT MY AIR BAG SYSTEM IS NORMAL NOTHING WRONG WITH IT . BUT 1 THING THAT I KNOW IF I GOT IN AUTO ACCIDENT AND AIR BAG SYSTEM IS NOT WORKED SOME ONE WILL HAVE  PROBLEMS . I NEED HELP TO LET HONDA MANUFACTURER TO AWARE   THIS PASSENGER SIDE AIR BAG GO OFF EVEN SOME 1 IS SITTING ON THE PASSENGER SIDE .  *TR
WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN  AT A BUSY AND DANGEROUS INTERSECTION I LOST POWER FOR SEVERAL SECONDS. I MANAGED TO PULL ONTO THE SHOULDER UNTIL THE CAR ACCELERATED AGAIN. I HAD CALLED THE DEALERSHIP PREVIOUSLY ABOUT THIS RECURRING PROBLEM. I TOOK THE CAR INTO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF THE DEALERSHIP PRIOR TO THE DATE OF THIS INCIDENT AND THE PROBLEM COULD NOT BE REPLICATED. BECAUSE OF SAFETY CONCERNS I TRADED THE CAR IN WITH MILEAGE AT LESS 2000.  *TR
2012 HONDA CIVIC. CONSUMER STATES PROBLEMS WITH VEHICLE AFTER RECALL REPAIRS *TGW  THE CONSUMER STATED AFTER THE RECALL WORK WAS COMPLETED, THE BRAKES STARTED MAKING A LOUD NOISE AND THE SPEEDOMETER INDICATED EIGHT MILES, WHEN IT WAS ACTUALLY AT A STOP. THE CONSUMER STATED SHE DID NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE, UNTIL SHE TOOK IT TO THE DEALER. *JB
I GOT INTO A ACCIDENT LAST MONDAY, FEB. 13, 2012, LIKE AROUND 8 OR 9 IN THE MORNING. I WAS MAKING A RIGHT TURN WHEN MY CAR WENT OUT OF CONTROL EVEN THOUGH I WAS ALREADY STEPPING ON THE BRAKES AND I WAS TRYING TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL TO THE LEFT BUT  THE CAR JUST KEPT GOING TO THE RIGHT UNTIL I HIT THE POLE SIGN THAT SAYS "NO PARKING AT ALL TIMES" (SOMETHING LIKE THAT). THE METAL POLE THAT I HIT BROKE AND ALMOST 1/4 OF THAT METAL POLE THAT WAS STUCK TO THE GROUND SCRAPED THE BOTTOM OF PART OF MY CAR AND THE BOTTOM COVERING FELL OFF AND IT COST $4,000.00 TO REPAIR AND NOW I HAVE TO PAY $500.00 FOR MY DEDUCTIBLE WHICH IS NOT EVEN MY FAULT WHY MY CAR DID THAT. IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME MY CAR DID THAT. IT DID SOMETHING WEIRD TWICE LAST YEAR BEFORE I GOT INTO THIS ACCIDENT LAST WEEK. FIRST WAS LAST YEAR, A MONTH OR TWO AFTER I GOT MY CAR WHEN I WAS DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY WHEN I TRIED STEPPING ON THE BREAKS AND INSTEAD OF MY CAR SLOWING DOWN, IT SUDDENLY ACCELERATED. THANK GOODNESS THERE'S NO CAR IN FRONT OF ME. THEN THE SECOND TIME WAS I THINK AROUND NOVEMBER OR DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR WHEN MY FRIEND WAS TEST DRIVING THE CAR TO SEE IF SHE WANTS TO BUY THE SAME THING. WE WERE TOGETHER IN THE CAR AND SHE WAS DRIVING WHEN SHE STOPPED STEPPING ON THE GAS AND BRAKES AND THE CAR JUST ACCELERATED BY ITSELF. SHE WAS SURPRISED THAT IT THAT BUT WE BOTH FIGURED THAT ANY CAR IS JUST LIKE THAT AND SINCE WE BOTH DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CARS WE THOUGHT IT WAS NORMAL FOR MY CAR TO ACCELERATE ON ITS OWN UNTIL I GOT INTO THIS ACCIDENT, THE POLICE TOLD ME THAT IT IS NOT NORMAL FOR MY CAR TO DO THAT SPECIALLY WHEN I'M ALREADY STEPPING ON THE BRAKES. :(  *TR
The ABS module is defective. I was told by the auto repair shop that he has been getting a lot of Honda vehicles that have defective ABS modules and that it should have a recall on this vehicle. This is dangerous for my vehicle to be on the road. The auto place is having a hard time finding a replacement part for my car. If this is happening to many other cars this should be a recall.
Car sitting on level ground, driven previous day with no problem. Upon unsuccessfully trying to start car, I smelled strong gasoline odor. I turned off ignition and opened hood and observed nothing unusual. I backed car up enough to get out to check for gas puddle. There was a puddle about 24 inches across of gasoline where car had been parked. I have arranged to have vehicle towed to independent auto repair. Note: gas was leaking from above rear driver's side wheel.
Electric Power Steering assist occasionally does not work when car is driving under a low speed, making the turning very diffcult.
My 2013 Honda Civic has just 80000 miles. 4 lights came on recently: ABS, Brakes, Power Steering and VSA lights. I took it to the honda dealership to get it diagnosed. They said it's the VSA modulator that has gone bad and needs replacing. The part is $1500 not including labor. This part is a known problem for civic and accord models and other honda models. My car still drive normal but those lights indicate a huge risk. I would like to get it repaired but the dealer said they don't have that part, it's on back order with no ETA. This means that it is a common problem where everyone is looking for it and supply ran out. Also I was told that Thailand did a recall on this part and honda agreed to the recall. This is a safety issue and many cars out there have same issues at even lower mileage than mine. And my car 80k miles is still very new. Would you please open an investigation and hopefully have honda do a recall on this part asap. Thanks, jeremy
THE VSA STAY ON AND MY POWER STEER TURN ON AND OFF SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO TURN I HARD TO PULL OVER THE FREEWAY  TO SHUT THE CAR OFF AND THEN ON IN ORDER TO RETAIN MY POWER STEERING, MY TRACTION CONTROL DOESN'T WORK WICH AM GUESSING IT'S RELATED WITH THE VSA AND MY AIRBAG LIGHT TURNS ON MY DASH THEN TURNS OFF AM A LITTLE TERRIFIED I MIGHT LOOSE COMPLETE CONTROL OFF MY CAR AND MY AIRBAG WILL GO OFF OR NOT EVEN POP OFF INCASE OF AN ACCIDENT OR I MIGHT CAUSE AN ACCIDENT IF I KEEP LOOSENING MY POWER STEERING (ELECTRONICAL POWER STEERING)
MY ABS, VSA AND POWER STEERING LIGHTS ALL CAME ON AT THE SAME TIME.  HONDA DEALER TOLD ME IT COSTS $1,600 TO 'REPLACE' ABS CONTROL MODULE WHICH IS OBSCENE AS THIS IS CLEARLY A SAFETY ISSUE, AND HE DIDN'T EVEN MENTION A FIX FOR VSA OR POWER STEERING. I TESTED A HARD BRAKE AND ABS FAILED.  WHAT IF MY POWER STEERING FAILS DURING A TURN AND I HIT SOMEONE?  HONDA SERVICE TECH SAID SCANS COULD NOT INDICATE A FIX.  GOOGLE / YOU TUBE SEARCH SHOWS THIS IS A CHRONIC PROBLEM WITH HONDA CIVIC AND ACORDS.  A SIMPLE FUSE MAY NEED TO BE REPLACED.  I BELIEVE HONDA NEEDS TO RECALL THIS DEFECTIVE FUSE AND REPLACE THEM FOR VEHICLE OWNERS FREE OF CHARGE BEFORE SOMEONE HAS AN ACCIDENT.
THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH MY VEHICLE.  I WANT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE LED LIGHTS ON MULTIPLE OTHER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD.  THEY ARE BLINDING, VERY DISTRACTING, AND SHOULD BE ILLEGAL.  SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE.  THE DATE ENTERED BELOW IS THE MOST RECENT OCCURRENCE, BUT IT HAPPENS REGULARLY - ALMOST DAILY.
WHEN THE CAR IS TURNED ON, A SIGN OF "CHECK AIRBAG" SHOWS UP.
IT WAS FINE WHEN I PARKED IT IN THE GARAGE THE NIGHT BEFORE BUT THE NEXT MORNING NONE OF THE FOLLOWING WERE WORKING AND THE DEALER HAS NO IDEA WHAT'S WRONG (THEY WANT TO TRY REPLACING WHOLE CONSOLE FOR $700 AND IF/WHEN THAT DOESN'T WORK TRY REPLACING SOMETHING ELSE FOR $$$):    - DASH (AND GEAR SHIFT, ETC.) DOESN'T LIGHT UP WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT  - WINDSHIELD DEFOGGERS  - SPEEDOMETER (READS "0" WHETHER IN MOTION OR STOPPED)  - ODOMETER  - WARNING INDICATORS (OVERHEAT, TIRE PRESSURE, ETC. EXCEPT "BRAKE" WHICH STILL WORKS, AND THE LITTLE GAS ICON ON THE LEFT CONTINUOUSLY BLINKS WHETHER FULL TANK OR NOT)  - GAS GAUGE  - GAS MILEAGE  - TACHOMETER (A PHYSICAL METER)  - AIR CONDITIONER  - OIL LIFE LEFT  - CRUISE CONTROL  - "ECON" MODE BUTTON DOESN'T WORK    - NOT SURE IF AIR BAGS WORK - I MAY FIND OUT SOMEDAY  - RADIO WORKS/DISPLAYS FINE    I AM NOT SURE OF THE EXACT DATE WHEN THIS HAPPENED, BUT IT WAS SOMETIME IN AUGUST 2017.
I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN SEPTEMBER 2015.  ABOUT A MONTH AFTER I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE THE SERVICE AIR BAG WARNING LIGHT CAME ON.  THE LIGHT WOULD GENERALLY GO OFF AFTER I TURNED IT OFF AND TURNED BACK ON.  I BROUGHT THE PROBLEM TO HONDA'S ATTENTION AND THEY SAID THAT IT WAS THROWING THE CODE DUE TO LOW VOLTAGE????  FAST FORWARD TO 12 MONTHS LATER AND THE LIGHT GOES ON AND OFF ABOUT 10+ TIMES PER DAY.  SEEMS TO ME THAT IF THE AIRBAG SYSTEM IS MALFUNCTIONING THAT THERE SHOULD CERTAINLY BE A RECALL.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 HONDA CIVIC. WHILE DRIVING 35 MPH, THE VEHICLE HYDROPLANED AND CRASHED HEAD ON INTO ANOTHER VEHICLE. THE AIR BAGS PARTIALLY DEPLOYED. THE CONTACT SUSTAINED AN UNKNOWN INJURY THAT REQUIRED MEDICAL ATTENTION. A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO AN IMPOUND LOT BY AN INDEPENDENT TOWING COMPANY. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 60,000.
STARTED VEHICLE AND NO RADIO STATION APPEAR ON LED COULD NOT CHANGE CHANNELS OR VOLUME.  AFTER ABOUT 20 MINUTES CHANNEL APPEARED AND I COULD CHANGE STATION AND VOLUME NOW. THIS HAS OCCURRED 3 TIMES WITHIN THE LAST YEAR.  ALSO THE VOLUME CONTROL KNOB FLICKERS MOST OF THE TIME
FIRESTONE AFFINITY TIRE FAILED DO TO MALFUNCTION IN TIRE SIDEWALL. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS CONDITION OR RESULT OF ROAD HAZARD. CRACK OR DAMAGE IN TIRE SIDEWALL RESULTED IN COMPLETE DEFLATION IN MATTER OF SECONDS. CONCERNED THAT THESE TIRES ARE UNSAFE.  *TR
WINDSHIELD FOGS UP RAPIDLY IN WINTER WITHIN FIRST FEW MINUTES OF DRIVING. FASTER THAN AIR CONDITIONING CAN DRY CAR INTERIOR. AS A RESULT, VISIBILITY IS REDUCED TO ZERO AND I ALWAYS HAVE TO PULL OVER TO WAIT 10 MINUTES FOR IT TO DRY. THIS HAPPENS ON COLD DAYS BELOW 30 F, BUT IT HAS NOT HAPPENED TO ME IN ANY OTHER CAR I DRIVE OR HAVE DRIVEN.  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 HONDA CIVIC. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHEN THE SUN WOULD SHINE ON THE DASHBOARD, IT CAUSED AN ABNORMAL GLARE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT INSPECTED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE ISSUE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 3000.
In a Honda CVT when the filter becomes clogged, pressure will build and the fill cap will come off the transmission on its own to relieve the pressure. There is no warning indication system to tell you when it happens but it seems to be a persistent issue in their CVTs. after the cap blows off fluid will start leaking on the casing and dirt and other contaminates will make their way into the transmission. This poses a massive safety issue as it can cause the transmission to lock up. When going to use professional service websites such as pro-demand and all data Honda gives no information about this issue or even how to fix it.
The plug for the transmission fill continually pops off. This is apparently is a common problem with this model.
This vehicle's VSA modulator is faulty. Lots of people have issues with this system. HONDA instead of helping, they have monopoly on parts and no other mechanic will fix it because honda is not allowing them so they can charge 2000$ to fix faulty VSA modulator. It's absurd that consumers doesn't have choice to fix their car from a faulty part that can only be fixed at Honda dealership. Please investigate this, I think they're doing this intentionally because it's making them money and they have no one to compete. Other similar Hondas have same faulty vsa modulator as well. Thank you
The fill cap for the transmission keeps coming out of my transmission on my 2014 honda civic LX ans there is transmission fluid everywhere.
I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK ON THE FREEWAY AND WHEN I GOT OFF THE FREEWAY I STOPPED AT THE STOP LIGHT WHEN IT TURNED GREEN I STARTED TO PUSH THE GAS PEDAL AND THE CAR STARTED JERKING BACK AND FORTH LIKE IT WANTED TO STALL I PUSHED ON THE GAS A LITTLE MORE AND IT CONTINUED TO JERK AT EACH STOP LIGHT WHEN I ACCELERATED. NO WARNING LIGHT CAME ON NO CODES AND IT JUST HAPPENED SUDDENLY WITH OUT WARNING . I PARKED IT AND TOOK IT TO THE SHOP THE FOLLOWING MORNING
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 HONDA CIVIC. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING AT VARIOUS AT SPEEDS, THE TPMS WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED WITH CHECK TIRE PRESSURE MESSAGE DISPLAYED ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL. THE TIRE PRESSURES WERE CHECKED AND VERIFIED THAT THE CORRECT PRESSURE FOR EACH TIRE WAS CORRECT HOWEVER, THE WARNING MESSAGE REMAINED ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT TAKEN TO THE DEALER TO BE DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 221,000.
I HAVE A 2014 HONDA CIVIC WITH 136000 ON THE CAR THAT HAS A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM STARTING. SOME 2014 HONDA CIVIC WERE RECALLED FOR A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM YET MY VEHICLE, 2014 CIVIC MODEL MISS THE RECALL. ALL CIVICS HAVE A PRETTY SIMILAR SETUP AS FAR AS THE ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION. AS FAR AS HONDA GOES THEY ARE KNOWN FOR THERE ENGINES LASTING A WHILE AND HAVING NO ISSUES YET I HAVE A TRANSMISSION ISSUE THAT IS YET UNKNOWN AND WILL COST AT LEAST 5K TO FIX.  OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS THE CARS ABILITY TO ACCELERATE AND DOWNSHIFT HAS GOTTEN WORSE. THIS CAR HAS A AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION YET WHEN YOU SLOW DOWN THEN GO TO ACCELERATE THE CAR JUMPS GEARS, YOU GET THE FEELING AS IF YOU ARE ON A MOTORCYCLE AND IT STALLS AND JUMPS FORWARD. ALONG WITH THAT THERE'S A SLIGHT NOICE THAT IS WORKING OVERTIME. (INCIDENT OCCURS AROUND 2MPH-65)
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,   I WOULD LIKE TO REPORT A SAFETY ISSUE WITH A VEHICLE. I AM NOT THE OWNER OF THE VEHICLE THAT I AM REPORTING, BUT I WAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY A FIRE THAT THE VEHICLE CAUSED. MY VEHICLE WAS PARKED IN A PUBLIC PARKING GARAGE ON THE 1ST FLOOR. SEVERAL HOURS AFTER PARKING MY CAR, A BMW X5 PARKED NEXT TO MY VEHICLE. THE OWNER OF THE BMW LEFT THEIR VEHICLE AND TURNED THE CAR OFF. HOWEVER, WHILE THE OWNER WAS AWAY FROM THE CAR, THE VEHICLE CAUGHT FIRE. THE FIRE SPREAD TO 4 OTHER VEHICLES INCLUDING MY VEHICLE ' THE TWO VEHICLES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CAR AND TWO VEHICLES ON THE 2ND FLOOR OF THE PARKING GARAGE. MY VEHICLE WAS DESTROYED AS A RESULT OF THIS FIRE. THE FIRE ENGULFED THE PASSENGER SIDE OF MY VEHICLE AND COMPLETELY DAMAGED THE INTERIOR. WITH ALL THE DAMAGES THAT MY CAR SUSTAINED, IT IS NOT DRIVEABLE NOR IS IT REPAIRABLE. MY INSURANCE HAS A BETTER RECORD OF THE COMPLETE DAMAGE TO MY VEHICLE. UPON, EXPLORING THIS ISSUE, I FOUND THAT THIS SPECIFIC BMW WAS LISTED AS AN AFFECTED VEHICLE FOR RECALL. NHTSA ISSUED SEVERAL RECALLS FOR PARTS OF THE VEHICLE THAT COULD CATCH FIRE EVEN WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS NOT IN OPERATION. FOR EXAMPLE:   REPORT RECEIPT DATE: 10-30-2017  NHTSA CAMPAIGN: 17V683000  MANUFACTURER: BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, LLC  CONSEQUENCE: AN ELECTRICAL SHORT CAN CAUSE THE PARTS WITHIN THE PCV VALVE TO MELT, INCREASING THE RISK OF A FIRE, EVEN WHEN THE VEHICLE IS NOT IN USE.     THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE AND BMW SHOULD BE MORE ATTENTIVE AND RESPONSIBLE ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AS A RESULT OF THIS, I HAVE LOST MY CAR AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RECOUP THE RETAIL VALUE OF THE VEHICLE. THIS INCREDIBLY UNFAIR AND BMW SHOULD BE DOING MORE TO REMEDY THIS ISSUE AND HELP THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.   THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER.
I WAS DRIVING,MY SON HAS BIPOLAR DISORDER AND HE WAS ON THE PASSENGER SEAT;HE GOT UPSET AND SHIFTED GEAR FROM DRIVING TO NEUTRAL WHILE I WAS DRIVING AT ABOUT 60 MILES PER HR.  ISN'T SUPPOSE TO LOCK GEAT WHILE THE CAR IS MOVING?
WHILE DRIVING, I HEARD A LOUD, GUNSHOT LIKE SOUND AND GLASS STARTED FALLING ON ME. MY SUNROOF HAD JUST APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN HIT WITH SOMETHING OUT OF NOWHERE. I SAFELY PULLED OVER AND BEGAN LOOKING FOR ANYTHING THAT MIGHT APPEAR TO HAVE HIT IT BUT ONLY FOUND THE GLASS APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN HIT FROM THE INSIDE. THE SUNROOF WAS COMPLETELY SHATTERED BUT LUCKILY DIDN'T FALL COMPLETELY APART.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 HONDA CIVIC. WHILE DRIVING VARIOUS LOW SPEEDS, THE TRANSMISSION EXHIBITED A SEVERE VIBRATION WITH A COMPLETE LOSS OF ACCELERATION. THERE WAS NO PRIOR WARNING OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS COASTED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND TOWED TO THE DEALER. THE MECHANIC DISCOVERED METAL SHAVINGS IN THE DARKENED TRANSMISSION FLUID AND STATED THAT THE TRANSMISSION WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED. THE VIN WAS NOT INCLUDED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 15V574000 (POWER TRAIN). THE CONTACT MENTIONED THAT IF THE VEHICLE WERE SERVICED UNDER THE RECALL, IT MAY POSSIBLY HAVE PREVENTED THE TRANSMISSION INTERNAL DAMAGES. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 103,000.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 HONDA CIVIC. WHILE ACCELERATING FROM A STOP, THE VEHICLE HESITATED TO SHIFT INTO GEAR. THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS FAILED TO ILLUMINATE THE ROADWAY ADEQUATELY AT NIGHT.

THIS IS THE SEVENTH  (7) COMPLAINT I HAVE FILED IN REGARD TO A NEW HONDA CIVIC I PURCHASED FROM FRANK FLETCHER HONDA IN BENTONVILLE, AR. THE CAR HAS ALSO BEEN TAKEN TO THE DEALERSHIP SEVEN TIMES WITH NO RESOLUTION. I AM STILL BEING FORCED TO DRIVE A VEHICLE WHICH IS NOT SAFE. AT APPROXIMATELY 1:45 P.M. MY HUSBAND PICKED ME UP FROM WORK FOR LUNCH. AS WE WERE DRIVING DOWN THE RODE, WE FELT A "SLIPPING" MOVEMENT AND THE CAR BEGAN TO STALL OUT. FOLLOWING THIS WAS A SERIES OF SMALL JERKING MOVEMENTS AS WE CONTINUED TO DRIVE. A WEEK AGO MY ATTORNEY FILED LEGAL DOCUMENTS UNDER THE ARKANSAS AUTO LEMON LAW AGAINST HONDA AMERICA. THE VEHICLE HAS MET ALL REQUIREMENTS UNDER THIS LAW. I AM HOPING NHTSA WILL TAKE MY COMPLAINTS SERIOUSLY AND MONITOR HONDA AMERICA'S ACTIONS TOWARDS CONSUMERS AND THE VEHICLES THAT ARE BEING SOLD WHICH HAVE SAFETY ISSUES.  *TR
THE TIRE PRESSURE WARNING LIGHT CAME ON JULY 10, 2014. ALL TIRES MEASURED 33 PSI. ON JULY 16, SIX DAYS LATER AFTER THE DEALER RESET THE SYSTEM THE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN. ALL TIRES MEASURED 33 PSI AND AGAIN THE DEALER RESET THE SYSTEM. HONDA AMERICA WAS CONTACTED AND INDICATED THEY WOULD HAVE A SOFTWARE FIX BY THE END OF JULY. ON OCTOBER 13, 2014 THE TP LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN AND THE TIRES MEASURED 33 PSI. THE DEALER WILL HAVE ANOTHER GO AT RESETTING THE SYSTEM ON 10/14/2014 FOR THE THIRD TIME. THE CAR NOW HAS 2596 MILES ON IT. WHAT IS HONDAS PROBLEM?  *TR
Airbag light came on intermittently.  Had module and something else replaced by McCarthy Honda in Overland Park, KS.
Driving down the road heard a noise sounded like driving over a rumble strip, within 10 miles I could no longer drive forward from a stop.
Transmission: Pullingout  of parking and merging on to highway car feels like driving on Rumble road and losses traction.. My Daughters use this vehicle they no longer feel safe driving it. it's happened to me a.few times.as well. After doing some research it seems like lots of people are experiencing the same problem.. Who has that kind of cash to throw into a repair..
The transmission went out and requires full replacement after being inspected by my local Honda dealership. It is available for further inspection upon request.  My car stopped accelerating while on the interstate and required a tow on the shoulder of a 65-MPH highway.   The vehicle and component issues were confirmed by my local Honda dealership.  No.  There were two warning messages that populated immediately as the car died. By that time it was to late and the vehicle was inoperable. No other warning messages or lamps prior to the incident.  My VIN is associated with a previous safety recall (15V-574) that was issued for the same year, make, and model of vehicle. My VIN is identical to the range provided down to the production number. I believe that it is not a coincidence that it was manufactured in the same place and time down to the week of vehicles identified in that recall down to the production number, that is only barely out of range.
Pressure caused transmission plug to pop out unknowingly. Vehicle now jerks at low speeds or when accelerating from a full stop position. Likely that missing plug is allowing dirt and debris into transmission fluid. Transmission likely negatively impacted. This vehicle has less than 75,000 miles. Seems this vehicle should have been included with the NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID: 15V574000
The transmission failed; however, no code or warning appeared to indicate there was a problem. The only indication that there was an issue, we’re problems with acceleration. This was meant to be our newer reliable family vehicle for which we drive our two year old son in. Had the car broken down the wrong place and wrong time it could put our son and others in danger. Some sort of code should have appeared to indicate there was an issue before the transmission failed prematurely. The car had just a little over 100,000 miles when the transmission failed. The car was evaluated at a Honda service shop in Annapolis MD (west street). They determine the transmission failed and needed to be replaced. I suspect that 2015 Honda civics have transmission problems and defects. Although our VIN number is not associated with the 2014-2015 Honda Civic recalls, those recalls were transmission related issues. I don’t know that it is a coincidence, I suspect this year, make and model produced defective transmissions. The most concerning part is that no code nor check engine light appeared to warn us of the transmission issue. The car is currently in an transmission auto shop (glen Burnie, MD) waiting for a used transmission to be installed. It may take two to three weeks for the repairs.
I was driving in stop and go city traffic and came to a stop at a red light and noticed smoke or steam coming from the hood. Upon pulling away from the light once it turned green, I noticed I had reduced acceleration and pulled over quickly. I have yet to get it in to the Honda dealership but will shortly. Upon roadside inspection from a mechanic, it is confirmed the the cvt transmission plug has come off and the transmission has lost fluid. Additionally, when turning left, the car will jar around and rumble if you turn the steering wheel too much.
When I cold start my car it’s making this horrible metal cutting blade kind of sound sometimes, That goes away 5 seconds after cold starting   the problem is the vtc actuator, many dealers took a look to not only mine but also my friends 2014 civic si, they said it was the vtc actuator and that they nor anyone else will fix the issue. This has also happened to handfuls of others.
WHEN TAKING OFF FAST OR SLOW HAS A LITTLE JERKING ACTION WHEN TAKES OFF , STALLS FOR A SEC .
WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AT 70MPH, THE ENGINE RPM RAPIDLY INCREASED WITH NO ACCELERATION.  THE DRIVER WAS ABLE TO CROSS 4 LANES AND GET TO THE SHOULDER SAFELY.  MULTIPLE WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON TO INCLUDE: CHECK ENGINE, CHECK TRANSMISSION, POWER STEERING, HILL START, AND TPMS.  THE CAR WOULD NOT SHIFT GEARS OTHER THAN PARK OR NEUTRAL.  THE ENGINE WOULD RESPOND NORMALLY WHEN THE PEDAL WAS PRESSED BUT WAS NOT ENGAGED BY THE DRIVE TRAIN.  THE CAR WAS TOWED TO A HONDA DEALER THAT FOUND THE TRANSMISSION DRIVE PULLEY HAD BROKEN REQUIRING A TOTALLY NEW TRANSMISSION.  NHTSA RECALL NUMBER 15V574000 WAS REFERENCED BUT HONDA WOULD NOT ACCEPT IT FOR COVERAGE OR AS A CAUSAL ISSUE.   SERVICE DEPARTMENT MEMBERS AT THE DEALER ADMITTED THAT THAT RECALLED ISSUE WAS AT FAULT FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO THE VEHICLE.  HONDA RECALL STILL REFUSED THAT THE CAR WAS NOT AFFECTED BY THE ISSUE LISTED IN 15V574000 AS IT WAS NOT TIED TO THE VIN IN THE HONDA DATABASE.  CAR INDICATIONS AND MAINTENANCE REPORTS LIST THE SAME INDICATIONS AND PROBLEMS LISTED IN THE RECALL.
DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND LOST ACCELERATION IN DRIVE POSITION.
IT WAS RAINING, I WENT TO SLOW DOWN AND IT WAS AS IF THE FRONT WHEELS LOCKED UP, TCS BLINKING ON AND OFF, AND THE TIRES REMAINED PULLING AS IF POWER WAS STILL BEING SENT TO THE FRONT TWO, LOCKED UP, TIRES AND I HAD NO CONTROL AS THE CAR PULLED ME STRAIGHT FORWARD INTO THE SIDE OF ANOTHER VEHICLE RESULTING IN A COLLISION THAT HAD ME HIT A STOPPED CAR SO HARD IT SPUN THE OTHER CAR AROUND AND TOTALED MY CAR. THIS ALL HAPPENED WITHIN 500 FEET OF WHERE I INITIALLY PULLED OUT ONTO THE ROAD I WAS TRAVELING ON WHEN THE CAR STARTED TO MALFUNCTION TO THE ROAD WHERE I ATTEMPTED TO TURN ONTO TO AVOID THE CRASH AND COULD NOT MANEUVER THE VEHICLE AT ALL.
TRANSMISSIONS LIGHT DID NOT GO ON TO ALERT NOW IS NOT MOVING
I THINK THE TRANSMISSION IS NOT MAKING THE CHANGES CORRECTLY
DRIVING NORMALLY WHEN A SUDDEN & VERY LOUD BANG/CRACK WAS HEARD AND I IMMEDIATELY FELT SMALL GLASS BITS FALLING ON ME. IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER AND SAW THAT THE SUNROOF HAD EXPLODED UPWARDS TOWARDS THE SKY WITH A LARGE HOLE IN THE CENTER AND A MUCH SMALLER HOLE ON THE DRIVERS SIDE. INCIDENT OCCURRED WHILE DRIVING WESTBOUND ON E NORTHWEST HWY BETWEEN TOWN NORTH DR & ABRAMS RD (DALLAS, TX 75231). NO OBJECTS FOUND IN THE CAR THAT WOULD IMPLY A FOREIGN OBJECT HITTING THE VEHICLE. NO BRIDGES WERE DRIVEN UNDER WHEN INCIDENT OCCURRED.
I JUST BOUGHT A CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED HONDA CIVIC (2015) AND THE VERY NEXT DAY, THE "CHECK AIRBAG SYSTEM" LIGHT CAME ON WHILE DRIVING. IT GOES OFF EACH TIME I START THE CAR, BUT COMES BACK ON AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF DRIVING.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 HONDA CIVIC. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS ON, IN NEUTRAL OR WHILE DRIVING, THERE WAS AN EXTREMELY STRONG VIBRATION.

The contact owns a 2016 Honda Civic. The contact stated that while driving at 55 MPH, there was an abnormally loud pop coming from the sunroof. There was no warning light. Illuminated. Upon inspection, the contact became aware of a large hole in the sunroof glass. The local dealer was contacted; however, the vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The contact was informed that the VIN was not under recall. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 166,655.
The steering sticks when driving straight  and needs additional force to correct causing an over correction. Vehicle can be difficult to keep in its lane.
I would like to request a SAFETY INVESTIGATION on my 2016 Honda Civic - My steering wheel is sticking as I drive. I thought it needed an alignment and have taken it to get an alignment twice (7/29/2021 and 3/4/2025). However, it is still sticking to the point I am scared to drive it as it seems I may lose control of the steering wheel trying to keep it in the road. This is a serious safety issue / hazard for me and other people on the highways. I called the Honda dealership to tell them of my issue, they said it was a SAFETY RECALL and to take it to the nearest Dealership, however upon googling the SAFETY RECALL it stated that there were recalls on this very same issue for the 2021 - 2024 models, it is occurring on models year much earlier than that, as my vehicle is a 2016. I only have 121,608 miles on my vehicle; this vehicle has never been in an accident. It is available for inspection upon request; the sticking of the steering wheel is a safety hazard for me and others on the highways that I travel. No, this problem has not been confirmed or inspected by a dealership or service center. There were/are no warning lights to assist me in figuring out the problem.
When driving down the highway the steering sometimes sticks or locks slightly. This is mainly when driving straight and doing a slight turn or correction. Alignment and balance are fine on the car. There are no warning lights. This is an intermittent problem and only occurs occasionally. I cant always duplicate. It has not been diagnosed by a mechanic yet as it is intermittent and it only occurs occasionally. Initially started around May of 2022 and has continued off and on since, most recently occurring on March 27th, 2025.
There is an active recall on the fuel pump for Honda Civics. My car fits within the range of time of manufacture, but my VIN does not appear with any recalls. The vehicle shakes when starting and will stall most of the time. I can turn it off and turn it back on and the car will start okay, but if I accelerate too quickly or drive too fast or for too long the engine will stall. I have been driving on the highway before and the engine stalls and I have to pull over. The car can be turned off and started again okay, but it’s a safety concern when it happens randomly on the highway with plenty of other cars around.
These vehicles have major paint issues. I experienced the paint flaking off the side back panel near the window and had to go through a somewhat annoying process to have the dealer look into it. After I had this issue I looked online to see if anyone has this same problem and it came to my attention that it is a nationwide issue that is not being addressed. Here is a link of other people who have experienced this issue, [XXX]  . The paint is too thin and loses it's clear coat easily then the color breaks and flakes off. I honestly believe this is a manufacture defect as so many cars are affected with the exact same issue. Now my car paint is peeling near the top of the window and I would like an investigation done. I have taken very good car of the vehicle, hand washes and it only has 15k miles. I paid over 28k for this car and didn't expect the paint to be so thin or poor. Please help myself and the many others that are having this issue by formally opening an investigation. I appreciate your time and your assistance. Take care!

Steering sticks at a certain point of turning which makes it difficult to maintain a straight path and has almost caused a collision due to the fact that you end up over correcting your current path so you may vere into the other lane. The problem occurs at different times and seems to be at it's peak when it's hot outside and gives no warning lights or any other visible signs as to when it will occur. I bought the car used and it had around 20,000 miles on it, I noticed the issue soon after that. I have not had the problem looked at yet because it has been manageable but I fear that it may get worse and I know I'm not the only one with this issue. My vehicle may be inspected up on request.
- HONDA CVT TRANSMISSION: 4356 - Went out.  Is available for inspection within the week. - My daughter was driving on the freeway in the fast lane when vehicle started making loud hum noise then, came to a stop.  She had to coast to the side of the road, where she was almost hit by multiple vehicles. - Yes Vehicle has been inspected by a independent service center - towed by USAA insurance. - Has been inspected by other: Davis Auto Clinic, Davis, CA 95616 - No warning lights came on, or symptoms of the problem.  Only hum noise which began 5 minutes before car stalled in middle of freeway.  First appeared at time of stall, no warning at all.
Driving down the road while at higher speeds the steering wheel sticks in one spot for minor adjustments. This can cause over corrections on the drivers part and may cause a wreck involving other vehicles. It has been documented on many forums online, about others having problems with the steering with the 2016 Honda civics. This is no exception.

I have a 2016 Honda civic around 48,000-50,000.00 miles I have noticed that the steering in my vehicle gets sticky/stuck while driving. This usually occurs on the highway while I’m driving at higher speeds and when I’ve been on the road for about 30 minutes. While driving on the highway the steering wheel gets “stuck” towards the left and I have to pull it to correct this position. It has made me fearful while driving especially at high speeds and I feel like the entire drive I have to white knuckle the wheel. If I do not continue to make the correction then the car would veer off into another lane. This is extremely dangerous and unsafe. It has also happened while I’ve slowed down to a traffic light and when I pulled the steering wheel back out of the sticky position I heard an adamant click. I started researching and saw there are hundred if not thousands of these reports. I did send Honda a message to open a case which they sent a standard message back just saying to bring it to the dealer and closed the case. This needs to be fixed or rectified by Honda. I saw that there were some lawsuits but that they didn’t include 2016. It seems that the problem with all of these is the EPS Rack Assembly which is a fault with the manufacturer.
Steering has become sticky, especially when driving straight on a highway or at higher speeds. Extra force is needed to maintain position in lane and move the wheel. The pressure required to turn the wheel past the stuck position causes the driver to over correct excessively making it difficult to stay in the lane.
The vehicle steering is sticky. When the vehicle is started, the steering is fine. However, after about 15 minutes of driving, the problem is most noticeable when trying to keep the car straight at around 40 mph and higher. When making fine adjustments to keep the car straight on the freeway, the steering gets stuck then suddenly releases when making fine adjustments. This causes the vehicle to jerk from side to side when trying to keep my vehicle in my lane...I have taken my vehicle in to 2 independent service centers but the problem seems to temporarily go away if the vehicle is turned off for a little while. Only to return when I leave the service center around 15 minutes later...There are no codes or warning lights that appear...My Civic is a 2016 but only has 12,400 miles. The steering problem started at around 9,000 miles.
The contact owns a 2016 Honda Civic. The contact stated that while driving at an undisclosed speed, the passenger's side air bag inadvertently deployed, shattering the windshield. No injury was sustained. There was no impact to the vehicle that could have caused the passenger's side air bag to deploy. The vehicle was taken to the dealer; however, no failure was found. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was 59,000.
When car is driven above 40 mph the steering wheel sticks.  Extra effort is required to maintain midline steering.  Extra effort is required to break the persistent sticking pattern, which can cause loss of control.
Paint is chipping around the back windshield and is starting to cause paint chipping towards the top of the vehicle. Have never been in a collision.
When traveling at highway speeds the steering wheel “catches” at center and feels almost stuck in position. This causes for over correction and an unsafe driving experience
Steering wheel sticks when driving at highway speeds and requires some force to correct in lane. This causes over-correction and vehicle moves in a jerky motion. No lights are on and this is extremely dangerous
I’ve had this car for about 1 year now. On the 4th month of having the vehicle I got the battery replaced by the dealer for free.  Now here we are a year later and my car is having the same issue. When I go to crank it, it stutters as if it doesn’t want to turn on than turns on. I went to autozone and they said battery needs to be changed again. Which makes no sense because never in my life have I had to change a battery 2x in year & it’s practically still a new vehicle. I started to investigate and when I go in my trunk That I barely use. I have a little bucket with things I keep in it. The bucket was filled with water as if it was leaking from the tail light area. So my trunk is soaked.  I’ve noticed before a little moisture back there but I thought nothing of it. I wonder if others are having the same issue or they may not have noticed yet. The vehicle getting wet in the inside can become a very big electrical & rust issue. Which is very unsafe, can lead to things like a fire or even mildew which can get you sick breathing in it. I feel this matter should be addressed and investigated immediately! For not only the safety of my self but the other civic drivers !
The contact owns a 2016 Honda Civic. The contact stated while driving 45 MPH while remaining in a straight line, the contact noticed that the steering had seized, caused the contact to manually put more pressure to steer the vehicle in a straight line to avoid the vehicle going into the other lane. The contact took the vehicle to the local dealer who inspected the vehicle and diagnosed the failure as a steering rack failure that needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 33,532.
2016 Civic air conditioner continues to blow hot air. Problem started in spring of 2018. Honda claimed they fixed in in summer of 2020 but it hasn’t worked at all in 2021. Seems to repeat pattern every spring.
VEHICLE IS LIGHTLY DRIVEN FOR 5 YEARS WITH ONLY 40K MILES. ALL RECOMMENDED SERVICES WERE PERFORMED ON SCHEDULE. SUDDENLY, THE A/C STARTED TO BLOW ONLY HOT AIR AND DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE ANY COOLING CAPACITY. THE SYSTEM IS LIKELY LEAKING REFRIGERANT AS HONDA HAS OFFICIALLY ACCEPTED THAT SOME A/C PARTS ARE IMPROPERLY MANUFACTURED FOR 16' HONDA CIVICS. A RECALL SHOULD BE CREATED FOR ALL 16' HONDA CIVIC A/C SYSTEMS.
I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING MULTIPLE ELECTRICAL ISSUES SINCE ABOUT 6 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE WITH BRAKE LIGHT BULBS REPEATEDLY BURNING OUT ALONG WITH EVERY SYSTEM ICON ON THE DASH FLASHING OFF AND ON WHILE DRIVING THE CAR IT WILL NOT START ALWAYS AND AT TIMES IT WILL NOT OPEN WITH THE KEY OR THE REMOTE FOB ALL BEING TAKEN IN TO SHOPS FOR REPAIRS AND WITHIN WEEKS I CAN BE BACK TO THE SHOP WITH YET ANOTHER SO CALLED FIX THIS RECURRING PROBLEM IS A BIG SAFETY ISSUE
AIRBAG SYSTEM (SRS) PROBLEM INDICATOR LIGHT CAME ON AT 101,597 MILES.  GOT INTO CAR AND STARTED IT, THEN LIGHT CAME ON.
2016 CIVIC WITH 23500 MILES ON THE ODOMETER. THE A/C COMPRESSOR HAS FAILED AND BLEW SMOKE INTO THE CABIN OF THE CAR. THERE IS AN EXTENDED REPLACEMENT WARRANTY FOR THE CONDENSER DUE TO KNOWN DEFECTS IN THE PART, BUT THE COMPRESSOR IS NOT COVERED THOUGH IT TOO IS FAILING AT AN ABNORMAL RATE FOR MANY OWNERS. HONDA DEALER IS CHARGING ME $1800 FOR THE REPAIR AND NOT REPLACING THE CONDENSER. MANY OWNERS ARE REPORTING RECURRING FAILURES OF THE CONDENSER, COMPRESSOR, AND/OR EVAPORATOR UNITS. THE A/C SYSTEM IN THESE VEHICLES HAS A DESIGN DEFECT AND SHOULD BE RECALLED.
THE AIR CONDITION IS NOT PROPERLY WORKING. EVEN IF YOU PUT ON HIGH IT TAKES 30-35 MINUTES TO COOL THE CAR....AND IT IS NOT THAT COLD.
I BOUGHT THE CAR USED WITH ONLY  20,000 MILES  AFTER DRIVING THE CAR ON THE HIGHWAY FOR AT LEAST 15 MINUTES SUDDENLY THE CAR BEGINS TO DRIFT EVER SO SLIGHTLY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. WHEN I GO TO CORRECT, THE STEERING WHEEL RESISTS. IT DOESN'T FREEZE BUT IT SORT OF "STICKS" UNTIL I APPLY A BIT MORE PRESSURE, AFTER WHICH IT SUDDENLY RELEASES, CORRECTS, AND ACTS COMPLETELY NORMAL. MOMENTS LATER HOWEVER, IT DRIFTS THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, AND I AM FORCED TO REPEAT THE SAME PROCESS ALL OVER AGAIN. END RESULT IS I BEGIN DRIFTING SLIGHTLY BACK AND FORTH DOWN THE HIGHWAY REPEATEDLY, ALL THE WHILE FIGHTING WITH A STEERING WHEEL THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO WANT TO LET GO. I HAVE BEEN READING MANY COMPLAINTS OF THIS BEING A RECALL ON THE CAR IN THE 2017 / 2018 MODEL YEAR. WHY NOT IN 2016?
AIR CONDITIONER IN 2016 CIVIC FAILED IN NOVEMBER OF 2019. HONDA COVERED THE CONDENSER BUT CHARGE FULL RACK TO REPLACE A CONNECTING HOSE, $450. NOW JUNE OF 2020 SAME ISSUE WHERE A/C IS BLOWING HOT AIR. HONDA DEALER TELLS ME THAT THE CONDENSER AND COMPRESSOR NEED TO REPLACED. CONDENSER IS UNDER EXTENDED WARRANTY. COMPRESSOR WAS REPLACED AT A COST OF $1600. THESE PARTS ARE ALL FAULTY NEED TO BE COVERED. CAR WAS PURCHASED IN 2018 AS A CPO FROM HONDA DEALER. CAR HAS UNDER 63K MILES.  *TR
MY 2016 HONDA HAS BEGAN TO BLOWN HOT AIR THROUGH MY AIR CONDITIONING UNIT WHILE I'M DRIVING MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT TO BREATH.THIS BEGUN ON 4/2020 WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY.  I TOOK MY CAR TO NORM REEVES HONDA IN THE CITY OF CERRITOS, CA AND THEY SAID THAT THE CONDENSOR IS LEAKING AS WELL AS THE EVAPORATOR. THE CONDENSORS THAT HONDA HAS BEEN USING ON THERE 2016 - 2018 HONDA CIVICS HAVE A HISTORY OF FAILING AND THAT IS WHY HONDA IS NOW EXTENDING THERE WARRANT OF THEM FOR AN EXTRA TWO YEARS HOWEVER HONDA ALSO KNOW THAT THE EVAPORATORS ARE DEFECTED ALSO. I HAVE SPOKE WITH AMERICAN HONDA AND THEY ARE AWARE OF MY PROBLEM AND REFUSE TO HELP. HONDA ALSO KNOWS THAT YOU CAN'T REPLACE THE CONDENSOR WITHOUT SERVICING THE EVAPORATOR AND THAT IS THE WAY THAT THEY AVOID HAVING TO REPAIR THE DEFECTED PART ON YOUR VEHICLE. TO REPLACE THE LEAKING EVAPORATOR, HONDA SAID THEY WOULD CHARGE ME $1,609 AND EVEN THOUGH THIS DEFECTIVE PART WAS CAUSING ME BREATHING TROUBLE, THAT THE EVAPORATOR IS NOT COVERED IN THE NEW EXTENDED WARRANTY AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO COME UP WITH THE MONEY. IF HONDA HAD MADE ME AWARE OF THIS DEFECT AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE, I WOULD HAVE NEVER PURCHASED THIS CAR. I BELIEVE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THAT THE CAR IS PUMPING HOT AIR INTO THE VEHICLE EVEN WHILE TURNED OFF CAUSING BREATHING TROUBLE AS WELL A VISION TROUBLE FOR ANY DRIVER IN THE CAR.

MY STATIONARY CAR  WAS PARKED ON A FLAT SURFACE IN THE GARAGE. I WENT INSIDE WHEN MY NEIGHBOR INFORMED ME THAT THE CAR HAD BACKED OUT OF MY GARAGE AND ROLLED DOWN THE HILL INTO MY NEIGHBORS DRIVEWAY, HITTING THEIR CAR. NO ONE WAS IN THE CAR.
STEERING AT 40 PLUS MPH GETS STIFF MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO STAY IN LANE
STICKY STEERING WHEEL. SUBTLE MOVEMENTS CAUSE RESISTANCE AND FORCE ME TO JERK THE STEERING WHEEL IN A SPECIFIC DIRECTION. THIS ONLY HAPPENS AFTER YOU'VE BEEN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY FOR 30-40 MINUTES. CAR WAS BOUGHT NEW IN 2016.
A/C COMPRESSOR FAILURE.
STEERING WHEEL IS NOTCHY, WHEN I DRIVE THE STEERING WHEEL STICKS AND THERE DOESN'T WANT TO TURN MAKING THE CAR WEAVE. ALSO WHEN IT'S IN PARK AND YOU TRY TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL SLOWLY IT SHAKES AND JITTERS. CAR FEELS VERY UNSAFE WHILE DRIVING
TAKARA RECALL  I BOUGHT THE CAR MARCH 2016. SUMMERS GET PRETTY HOT IN OHIO SO OF COURSE I HAVE TO USE THE AC. WORKED PERFECTLY THAT YEAR. WELL THE FOLLOWING YEAR WHEN I WENT TO USE IT IT NEVER WORKED AT ALL. BLEW OUT WARM AIR AND NEVER COOLED DOWN. SO WHEN I CONTACTED THE DEALER THEY SAID " MAYBE YOU HAVE A PIN HOLE IN A LINE, MAYBE COMPRESSOR, LOW FREON OR SOMETHING ELSE." I WAS PRETTY UPSET THAT IT WASN'T UNDER WARRANTY ANYMORE BUT HOW COULD SOMETHING GO WRONG AFTER ONE SUMMER. I HAVE KIDS AND I'M UNABLE TO TAKE THEM ANYWHERE IN MY CAR BECAUSE IT'S SO HOT. I HAVE A BUDDY WHO HAS THE SAME YEAR AND TYPE VEHICLE AND HE HAS ACTUALLY THE SAME PROBLEM. I HAVE READ PLENTY OF OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS AND WONDER WHY THE AC SYSTEM HASN'T HAD A RECALL YET. TOLD IT COULD COST UP TO $1000.00 TO FIX. DEALERSHIP HAS HAD COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS AND CANT DO ANYTHING UNTIL A RECALL IS IN PLACE BUT SAID THEY WILL REIMBURSE ME WHEN THERE IS ONE SO HOLD ON TO RECEIPT. SEEMS TO BE A COMMON ISSUE. I REALLY HOPE HONDA LOOKS INTO THIS MATTER. BECAUSE IT IS REALLY UPSETTING THAT THIS HAPPENED ONLY AFTER ONE YEAR OF DRIVING IT.
HAD BRAKES DONE CAR RAN PERFECTLY FINE UNTIL I DROVE ABOUT 71 MILES OUT PARKED CAR AND GOT BACK INTO CAR TURNED IT ON AGAIN TO HEAD BACK HOME WHEN ANTI BRAKE SYSTEM WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON THIS IS ELECTRIC PARKING BRAKE PROBLEM, BRAKE SYSTEM PROBLEM, BRAKE HOLD SYSTEM PROBLEM. THE BRAKE SYSTEM LIGHT STAYS ON AND WHEN ACCELERATING THE RED BRAKE LIGHT FLASHES UNTIL THE CAR IS EITHER PLACED ON CRUISE CONTROL OR COMES TO A COMPLETE STOP ON ON DRIVE REVERSE IT DOES NOT FLASH.
IN THE SUMMER OF 2018, WITH THE AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM ON, IT WAS BLOWING WARM AIR ON THE DRIVER SIDE WHILE THE PASSENGER SIDE DISCHARGING COLD AIR.  TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER FOR INSPECTION.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT INFORMED US THERE WAS A LEAK.  A DYE WAS ADDED TO THE RECHARGED REFRIGERANT.  EARLY THIS MONTH, APRIL, THE AC WASN'T PROVIDED ANY COOLING.  TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND WAS INFORMED THAT THE AC COMPRESSOR ALONG WITH REFRIGERANT PIPING WAS LEAKING AND NEED TO BE REPLACED.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2016 HONDA CIVIC. WHILE DRIVING 55 MPH, THE SUN ROOF EXPLODED WITHOUT IMPACT. THERE WERE NO INJURIES. THE DEALER (HOLLER HONDA, 2211 N SEMORAN BLVD, ORLANDO, FL 32807, (877) 872-9906) WAS CONTACTED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 25,000.
STATIONARY CAR COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN, WOULD NOT START, BATTERY CHECK OK, COULD NOT TAKE OUT OF PARK, HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED TO SHOP AND HAVE TCM REPLACED AND SOFTWARE UPDATED- IN MOTION -STEERING WHEEL SLIPS AND SHAKES AS WELL -  VERY DISAPPOINTED IN HONDA.
I NOTICED THAT THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD START BEING STICKY AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. . THE POWER STEERING WORKED FINE BUT FOR SUBTLE MOVEMENTS, IT WOULD CAUSE RESISTANCE.   THIS WAS MOST FREQUENT WHEN DRIVING OVER AN HOUR AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.INTERMITTENTLY WILL NOTICE THAT THE WHEEL TENDS TO STICK AFTER IT'S BEEN STRAIGHT FOR A COUPLE SECONDS AND I NEED TO APPLY MORE FORCE TO MAKE A SMALL ADJUSTMENT ON THE HIGHWAY. I DO NOT HAVE THE LKAS. IT SEEMS TO BE AN ISSUE WITH THE ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING.
TRUNK AND WINDOWS OPEN ON THEIR OWN. THE VEHICLE IS STATIONARY, ENGINE OFF, PARKED. BRAKE HOLD COMES ON AUTOMATICALLY WHILE DRIVING AT LOW SPEEDS IN CITY. REMOTE LOCK/UNLOCK ON KEY HAS INTERMITTENTLY NOT WORKED. WHILE DRIVING AT HIGH SPEEDS ON HIGHWAY, DOORS KEPT LOCKING AND UNLOCKING ON THEIR OWN. VERY FEARFUL ABOUT THE ELECTRONICS SYSTEM. THIS HAS HAPPENED OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS.
ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL DOES NOT BREAK CAR WHEN CAR AHEAD SLOWS.   SYSTEM THROWS 'COLLISION BRAKING MITIGATION SYSTEM', 'LANE KEEPING ASSIST', AND 'ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL' WARNINGS.   DEALER HAS ATTEMPTED TO REPAIR WITHOUT SUCCESS.
ON MAY 09, 2017 I WAS REAR ENDED WHILE SITTING STILL BY A CAR TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 45 MPH AND PUSHED INTO THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. I WAS WEARING MY SEATBELT AND MY FACE WAS PROJECTED INTO THE STEERING WHEEL.  DURING THE IMPACT MY SEATBELT DIDN'T SEEM TO ACTIVATE AND NOT ONE AIRBAG DEPLOYED.  MY VEHICLE HAS NOT BEEN INSPECTED YET BUT I WOULD GUESS IT TO BE TOTALED DUE TO THE FRONT AND REAR IMPACT DAMAGE.  EVERYONE I'VE SPOKE TO INCLUDING THE POLICE OFFICER AND WRECKER SERVICE WAS VERY SURPRISED THAT THE AIRBAGS DIDN'T DEPLOY.  I FEEL VERY LUCKY BUT DO NOT TRUST THIS VEHICLE AND IT'S SAFETY FEATURES.
TAKATA RECALL    I RECEIVED POSTAL MAIL ABOUT A RECALL PENDING ON MY VEHICLE THAT WAS TO BE COMPLETED IN FALL 2016.  IT IS NOW JANUARY/WINTER 2017 AND THERE HAS BEEN NO UPDATE.

THE THIRD BRAKE LIGHT COVER (INSIDE TOP CENTER OF REAR WINDOW) ON MY 2016 HONDA CIVIC COUPE IS LOOSE/DROOPING/FALLING OFF ON THE BACK PASSENGER SIDE WITH RIGHT-REAR OF COVER SEPARATED BY ABOUT 1/4" GAP FROM INSIDE OF REAR WINDOW. THIS CONDITION HAS EXISTED SINCE I PURCHASED THE CAR ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2016. THIS ALLOWS DISTRACTING LIGHT LEAK WHILE DRIVING AT NIGHT AND IMPAIRS VISIBILITY THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW. BASED UPON INFORMATION ONLINE HONDA DOES NOT YET HAVE A FIX FOR THIS EVEN THOUGH IT HAS BEEN WIDELY REPORTED OCCURRING ON THE 2016 CIVIC COUPES SINCE JUNE 2016..
DRIVING THE CAR HOME AT 7 PM AND HEARD A LOUD POP NOISE LIKE A GUNSHOT.  NO OTHER VEHICLES IN SITE AND ON A ROAD WHERE THERE ARE NO HOMES JUST OPEN FIELDS.  PULLED OVER TO FIND THE SUNROOF HAD A HUGE HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND THE REST OF THE GLASS THAT WAS STILL TACT WAS IN TINY PIECES LIKE AND LOOKED LIKE A SPIDER WEB.   THE GLASS WAS PROTRUDING UPWARD LIKE IT HAD PRESSURE FROM THE INSIDE.  HAD THE THE VISOR FOR THE SUNROOF BEEN OPEN IN THE CAR WHILE IT WAS BEING DRIVEN THIS GLASS WOULD HAVE FALLEN DIRECTLY INTO OUR EYES POSSIBLY CAUSING VISION PROBLEMS.  I CALLED HONDA CARE AND THEY WOULD NOT COVER THE REPAIR BECAUSE THEY SAID BY THE TIME THE CAR GOT TO THE DEALER SHIP TO BE REPAIRED IT HAD VERY LITTLE GLASS LEFT IN IT.  THIS CAR HAS UNDER 2500 MILES ON IT AND I HAVE NOT EVEN PAID THE FIRST NOTE.
3RD REAR BRAKE LIGHT COVER ON 2016 CIVIC COUPE CAME LOOSE AND WHEN BRAKES ARE USED 3RD BRAKE LIGHT REFLECTS ON REAR WIDOW CAUSING VISIBILITY PROBLEM AT NIGHT. ALSO COVER FLAPS AGAINST WINDOW WHEN WINDOWS OF CAR ARE OPEN.DEALER TRIED TO GLUE COVER IT LASTED 15 MINUTES. THEY SAID THE CURRENTLY HAVE NO FIX. HONDA NEEDS TO FIX THIS DESIGN FLAW PROBLEM ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE.
DAILY MAYBE A FEW TIMES A DAY WHEN I ATTEMPT TO ACCELERATE FROM A STOP THE CAR HESITATES FOR 1-3 SECONDS BEFORE THE THROTTLE RESPONDS. THIS IS POSSIBLY DANGEROUS BECAUSE IF PULLING AWAY WHEN THERE IS A LIMITED OPENING TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE INTERSECTION IT COULD CAUSE ACCIDENTS. I'M WONDERING IF IT HAS TO DO WITH THE CVT TRANSMISSION AS MY 2015 HONDA CIVIC WITH CVT ALSO HAD THIS ISSUE FROM TIME TO TIME.    THIS ISSUE HAPPENS DAILY AND USUALLY IN THE MORNING ON A LEFT TURN ABOUT 3/4 MILE FROM MY HOME. USUALLY AT THE SAME CORNER DAILY IN THE MORNING BUT IT DOES HAPPEN AT OTHER TIMES THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND I THINK IT MAY BE MORE COMMON NOT LONG AFTER STARTING TO DRIVE AFTER HAVING BEEN SITTING FOR A BIT.    I LOVE HONDA'S AND HAVE HAD MANY OF THEM BUT THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND RESOLVED!
WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE AND USING THE CRUZE CONTROL IN OUR TOURING MODEL THE SYSTEMS WOULD FAIL AND THE DISPLAY MULTIPLE ERRORS LIKE STABILITY CONTROL AND COLLISION MITIGATION HAVE FAILED. TO RESET THESE WE HAD TO PULL OFF THE ROAD STOP THE ENGINE AND RESTART. WE HAVE VIDEOS OF THE DISPLAYS. IT HAPPENED AT ANY SPEED.  THE PROBLEMS STARTED SHORTLY AFTER WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE. WE TOOK IT TO THE DEALER 7 TIMES AND WAS ONLY FIXED AFTER WE THREATENED TO PROCEED WE THE TEXAS LIMON LAW.
PISTON CLIP RING RECALL FROM HONDA WITH NO FIX UNTIL MID-MARCH AS TOLD BY HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE.  RECALL NOT PUBLICLY RELEASED BY HONDA AT THIS TIME. THE RESULT OF THIS PART FAILURE IS ENGINE FAILURE, AND/OR STALLING.  IT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE WITH SUCH LOOMING AND UNRESOLVED ISSUES.
The steering wheel of the vehicle often feels like it gets stuck around the 12 o’clock position frequently. Extra force is needed to correct steering. Then you have to correct the correction. The symptoms occur more often than not. This condition was discovered shortly after purchasing the used car. Honda dealer said steering rack would need replaced. The vehicle does not display any codes or service warnings. Since there are no recalls on this VIN#, I assume this will NEVER cause an accident to the occupants or others on the road.
The issue I am having on my 2017 Honda Civic is steering issues. Especially when it is warmer, the steering sticks and is jerky when trying to keep it in a straight line. It feels very unsafe and unstable driving especially on a highway at a higher speed limit. When needing to make a slight merge, with the steering sticking, you feel it jerk when you have to merge. This has happened constantly since last summer.
The air conditioning stopped working for the second time.  So far the compressor bearing has been replaced as well as the condenser.
I heard there is a recall on newer Honda Civics and I have noticed with my car a "sticky" feeling with the steering wheel. I thought it was just me and when I read the recall this morning I thought oh my gosh that's what my car does!   My car would be available for inspection. My car has not been inspected for this issue. I have not had any warning lamps due to this issue.
This car has an air conditioning issue. Last year the air conditioning stopped working. took it to the honda dealership and they found an issue with the condenser and seals. they fixed it free of charge due to the extended warranty honda put out. not even a full year later the air conditioning stopped working again. took it back to the honda dealership and turns out it's the evaporator. it's not covered by the extended warranty. they quoted me $3,000 to repair it. honda knows the a/c parts are bad. they dont want to cover it.
Vehicle steering wheel will feel stiff and jerky when travellings at cruise speeds. Tendency to overcompensate corrections. Serious safety threat.
The power steering “sticks” and “requires slight, but manual force” to free it while driving causing the car to unexpectedly lose maneuverability.   It has not been inspected yet, but it is easy to confirm as it happens almost all the time.
My fuel injectors have failed for the second time today. The first time they failed at 54k miles and the second time they failed at 94k miles. Both times I was on the expressway driving at least 55mph when suddenly the car does not accelerate and I am forced to pull over as my car slows down. This is dangerous when I am on the expressway and suddenly I cannot maintain a safe rate of speed for this kind of road. Honda refused to replace the injectors the first time because I was past my general 36k mile warranty although I was still within my 60k powertrain warranty. Although the manufacturer of the injectors Keihin considers the injectors a powertrain component, Honda does not by definition in their warranty. I am now left with a repair bill of over $500 for the second time for fuel injectors and a fuel rail. Honda needs to be held responsible and ordered to issue a recall for this widespread issue.
BCM Failed causing an electrical start problem and the car will not completely turn off.  With BCM failed doors will not unlock with the remote and the car fails to start or starts and fails to turn off.   This is a known problem with these cars that honda will not address and a safety concern for my family as the car has turned itself off while in motion.
My 2017 Honda civic has been having steering issues for a while. It’s very hard to keep straight on a highway and it feels like my steering is sticking when trying to correct myself in a lane on highway. No warning lights on the dash or anything like that.The problem started off minor and not noticeable but now it’s really bad to where I’m swerving left and right on the highway trying to keep straight but it’s almost impossible. It makes me feel unsafe and uncomfortable when driving. It almost feels like I’m going to get pulled over for looking like a drunk driver. I took the car to my local car Honda  dealership and explained my problem to them and also told them my opinion saying it might be a steering rack issue since I see multiple problems that people post online with the same generation Civic. So they take my car in and run some test and say my car is all good and that they couldn’t replicate the problem. I think the most they did was align my car again which wasn’t really off. I take my car back and started driving for another week until I took the car back to Honda to see if they could take a look again because it just didn’t feel right. The second time I took it, same thing. Told me they couldn’t recreate the problem. I’m not sure if they checked the steering rack or not because I wasn’t told that they did and I’m assuming they didn’t because they would have to drop the whole front subframe. At that point I honestly didn’t know what to do. I tried taking it to a different shop (pep boys) to see if they could find anything and they couldn’t.
The contact owns a 2017 Honda Civic. The contact stated that the rear door locks were making squeaking sounds and the alarm would inadvertently be engaged at night. The contact stated that the vehicle would fail turn off and would go into ACC mode. The contact was unable to lock the doors. There was no warning light illuminated. The vehicle was taken to the dealer, where it was diagnosed that the BCM had failed and needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and informed the contact that the vehicle could not be repaired under NHTSA Campaign Number: 20V771000 (Electrical System, Back Over Prevention, Visibility/Wiper, Visibility, Exterior Lighting) because the VIN was not included. The failure mileage was approximately 39,500.
I purchased a 2017 Honda Civic LX from a local Honda. 10 minutes after leaving the dealership, the TPMS lights came on. Please note it was cold outside. Took the car to Autozone to have codes read. Code c0077-78 was detected. Once I got home, I checked the tire air pressure and the tire air pressure was low. I added air to tire afterward. I reset the TPMS and the TPMS light went away. The next day, the light came on for a few seconds after I started the car, but the light disappeared again. I didn't check the air pressure. I took it to Autozone to see if any codes were detected, but no codes were detected and all systems were functional.
The gear shift is loose. Not stable. With switch into a different mode with the slightest tap without having to have my foot on the brake or pushing the release button to move to a different gear.
Driving at 60MPH, heard a loud bang followed by an increase in wind noise. After pulling over, saw that the sunroof had a large hole in it with most of the broken glass falling into the sunroof soft cover. The remaining glass had a spider-web like pattern all the way to the border. There was no evidence of any foreign object in the sunroof area or any impact/collision. The car was not being driven under trees or other overhangs. There was rain in the vicinity, but no hail. Temperature was 45-50 degrees Fahrenheit.
The AC in my '17 Honda Civic Hatchback went out and I took it to the local dealership (where purchased) to have it diagnosed.  Upon review, they informed me the AC's evaporator unit is leaking and it will cost $2K to replace.  I'm aware there is a recall (TSB 19-091) on the condenser from 2016-2018 Civics.  Honda came out with a TSB regarding this issue, all 2016-2018 civics have 10yr/unlimited mile warranties now on condensers. TSB 19-091, dated Dec 11th 2019.  Per the bulletin: " American Honda is extending the warranty on the A/C condenser to 10 years from the original date of purchase with unlimited miles. This warranty only covers vehicles that have a defective A/C condenser from the factory. The A/C condenser was not manufactured to specification. As a result, tiny holes may develop in the condenser tube walls that allows the refrigerant to leak out. "  However, there seems to be an equally large number of complaints online about compressors and evaporators failing in those years of Civic as well.  As such, it turns out failure across ALL the components of the AC system (compressors/condensers/evaporators) is relatively common after only a handful of years.  I believe an amended bulletin should be provided to cover ALL repairs across the AC system.    As a Father, with two kids under the age of 2, it's not suitable for them to ride in a vehicle without AC.  Especially with the 100+ temps we get in the middle of Kansas in Summer.  Additionally, the lack of a function AC debilitates the function of the Defrost making it extremely dangerous to drive in foggy, rainy, and/or humid conditions.  There are multiple articles explaining these exact malfunctions as well:  https://www.civicx.com/forum/threads/2016-2019-evaporator-failures-leaks.52319/  https://www.reddit.com/r/Honda/comments/lyne6q/2017_honda_civic_ac_evaporator_leaking/?utm_source=BD&utm_medium=Search&utm_name=Bing&utm_content=PSR1  There were no warnings prior to my AC going out.
I WAS ON AN ERRAND TRIP FROM ALHAMBRA TO SANTA ANA. AIR CONDITIONER IS WORKING FINE UNTIL I STOPPED TO DROP OFF DOCUMENTS IN ALHAMBRA. THE AIR CONDITIONER STOPPED WORKING WHEN I RETURN AND STARTUP MY CAR.  MY VEHICLE WAS AT 66700 MILES. NO ACCIDENT HISTORY. NORM REEVES HONDA AT WEST COVINA DIAGNOSED BOTH A/C COMPRESSOR AND CONDENSER ARE LEAKING. REQUEST GOODWILL REPAIR FROM AMERICA HONDA BUT WAS ULTIMATELY DENIED.
DURING DRIVING OF THE VEHICLE AND AT VARIOUS SPEEDS ALL ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS WILL FAIL AND ALL WARNING LIGHTS COME ON. THIS INCLUDES ABS, TRACTION CONTROL, POWER STEERING, BRAKE ASSIST AND MORE. WHEN THIS OCCURS THE VEHICLE BECOMES ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO STEER AND HAS NEARLY RESULTED IN AN ACCIDENT BEFORE.  WHILE THE PREVIOUS OCCURRENCE HAPPENED AT APPROXIMATELY 35MPH IF THIS OCCURRED ON THE INTERSTATE IT WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY RESULT IN A MAJOR CRASH AND INJURY.
6 WEEKS AGO THE AIR CONDITIONER/WINDSHIELD DEFOGGER STOPPED WORKING IN MY 2017 HONDA CIVIC THAT I PURCHASED NEW WITH A 7 YEAR/120000 MILE WARRANTY. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP WHO DIAGNOSED CONDENSER FAILURE BUT CLAIMS THEY ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN PARTS TO PERFORM REPAIR. EVERY TIME I CALL I GET THE SAME "IN A FEW DAYS" EXCUSE.
MY VEHICLE'S AIR CONDITIONING STOPPED WORKING. WENT TO HONDA DEALERSHIP AND HAD TO PAY $206 TO FLUSH THE AC AND REPLACE THE FREON WITH DYE. APPROXIMATELY 5 MONTHS LATER THE A/C STOPPED WORKING AGAIN. WENT BACK TO HONDA DEALERSHIP. THE LEAK THEY STATE IS DUE TO THE A/C COMPRESSOR LEAKING. HONDA PROVIDED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE CONDENSER BECAUSE THEY ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH DEFECTIVE CONDENSERS. THE DEALERSHIP STATED THEY WILL NOT COVER BECAUSE IT IS THE COMPRESSOR, NOT THE CONDENSER. IT APPEARS HONDA HAS BEEN HAVING ISSUES WITH ALL COMPONENTS OF THE A/C OF THESE CARS. THEY WON'T COVER THIS AS I ONLY HAVE 46K MILES ON VEHICLE AND WANT TO CHARGE $2,049.00 TO REPLACE. IN MY OPINION, THE A/C SYSTEM IS DEFECTIVE AND ALL PARTS SHOULD BE COVERED.  *TR

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2017 HONDA CIVIC. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT START. THE CONTACT ATTEMPTED TO START THE ENGINE FIVE TIMES, BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. SEVERAL UNKNOWN WARNING INDICATORS WERE ILLUMINATED, INCLUDING FIVE "ELECTRIC PARKING BRAKE PROBLEM", "VEHICLE STABILITY ASSIST PROBLEM", AND "ELECTRIC POWER STEERING PROBLEM" MESSAGES THAT APPEARED. THE DEALER AND MANUFACTURER WERE NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 60,000.

I WAS LEAVING A PARKING LOT, APPROACHING A GATE WITH AN INDUCTIVE-LOOP TRAFFIC DETECTOR, WHICH CAN DETECT VEHICLES PASSING OR ARRIVING AT A CERTAIN POINT, ONCE A VEHICLE IS DETECTED THE GATE WOULD OPEN.  I WAS APPROACHING, MAYBE 50 FEET FROM THE GATE, AT APPROXIMATELY 5 MPH, WHEN THE ENGINE OF MY 2017 HONDA CIVIC REVVED UP AND ACCELERATED FORWARD TOWARDS THE GATE.  MY FOOT WAS NOT ON THE ACCELERATOR, AS I WAS APPROACHING THE GATE WHICH WAS STILL CLOSED.  THERE WAS NO DEBRIS ON THE FLOOR BOARD OR ANYTHING OBSTRUCTING THE PEDALS THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED IT TO DEPRESS THE ACCELERATOR.  I HAD TO ABRUPTLY DEPRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL TO AVOID STRIKING THE GATE.  MY HONDA IS EQUIPPED WITH HONDA SENSING AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS COULD HAVE OCCURRED, MAY BE AN ELECTRICAL ISSUE WITH THE THROTTLE SENSOR BECAUSE THE "BRAKE" WARNING WAS ON, IT OBSERVED THE GATE.
MY HONDA CIVIC 2017 CAR WAS IN MY DRIVEWAY  NOT MOVING WHEN I TURNED THE CAR ON AND ALL MY WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON AND I HAD NO POWER STEERING. I HAD MY CAR TOWED TO HONDA AND THEY SAW THAT MY SUB WIRING HARNESS WAS CHEWED WHICH CAUSED THE PROBLEM. HONDA SAYS THIS WIRING IS MADE FROM SOY BASED MATERIAL WHICH ATTRACTS RODENTS. THEY REPLACED THE WIRING AND IT COST ME 268.00 DOLLARS. THE PART ITSELF WAS ONLY 28.00 DOLLARS. THIS THEN HAPPENED TO ME AGAIN EXACTLY 2 WEEKS LATER WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED AGAIN. THIS TIME I FOUND OUT THERE IS A FIX FOR THIS. A SPICY TAPE THAT HONDA MAKES THAT CAN BE WRAPPED AROUND THE WIRING TO RESIST RODENTS I DON'T KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE THIS IS.THEY SAID THEY DON'T HAVE THE TAPE.. I AM CURRENTLY WAITING TO SEE WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO SINCE THEY KNOW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND MY CAR IS IN THE SHOP AGAIN GOING ON THE 2ND DAY. THER IS A CLASS ACTION SUITE THAT WAS FILED FOR THIS VERY SAME REASON. THIS DATES ALL THE WAY BACK TO 2010 I WAS TOLD.

I LEASED MY HONDA CIVIC FROM HERB CHAMBERS HONDA OF BOSTON IN NOV. 2016. IN MARCH 2017 MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. WHEN I TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICING, THEY TOLD ME THAT RODENTS HAD CHEWED ON THE WIRES UNDER MY VEHICLE. AFTER I DID SOME RESEARCH ON MY OWN, I FOUND OUT THAT MANY OTHER PEOPLE WERE HAVING THIS SAME ISSUE AND MY CAR RECEIVED DAMAGE TO THE WIRING (UNDER MY CAR) DUE TO THE SOYBEAN COATING THAT HONDA IS USING ON THE WIRE COVERS. I WAS TOLD THAT THIS IS NOT COVERED BY THE DEALERSHIP OR WARRANTY. REMIND YOU "THIS IS A LEASE." MY  BRAND- NEW LEASED CAR WAS COMPLETED DEAD AND WOULDN'T EVEN TURN ON. I AM LUCKY IT DIDN'T DIE ON ME WHILE I WAS DRIVING IT. I HAVE READ ONLINE COMPLAINTS THAT THIS HAS HAD TO OTHER PEOPLE WITH THIS DAMAGE TO THEIR VEHICLES.    I WAS QUOTED $2,600 IN REPAIRS. I ENDED UP PAYING A $500 DEDUCTIBLE TO MY INSURANCE COMPANY. THERE ARE CLASS ACTION LAW SUITS IN PLACE IN CA AND OTHER STATES REGARDING THE "SOY-BASED WIRE COVERING." THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND A RECALL NEEDS TO BE MADE BY HONDA.
We purchased the vehicle in Jan 2025. As the weather or the car warmed the steering gets stiff and hard to maneuver, making it difficult to stay in the center of the lane. There are times when it gets so bad I think a cop could pull me over for swerving. As I researched the symptoms I found that recall SB18-102 matched the symptoms and was for the same year, make, and model; however, my car’s VIN wasn’t included. I took the vehicle to a local Honda dealership on 6/16/25 who confirmed it was a power steering box failure and gave an estimate of $3,990.46 to fix it. That same day I called Honda customer care and submitted a case to try to get the costs covered due to their being a recall out on the same year, make, and model and issue as mine. They advised me to go back to the dealership and request my car be submitted for Honda’s Goodfaith assistance. I requested this on 7/9/25 and was told on 7/10/25 it was denied with no reasoning. The car has no warning signals however the issue persists. My fear is that it will lock up or not straighten up and I or my son (whom the car was purchased for) will run off the road or cause an accident. This is obviously a known issue but Honda is not taking ownership and declined to help with the cost, which is almost a third of the cost of the vehicle we paid.
Driving at moderate speeds causes steering wheel to become sticky, notchy and stiff. Gets stuck to the left or right when turning. Causes car to go out of lanes and overall hard to adjust the wheel
1.Component or System Failure: •What component or system failed or malfunctioned, and is it available for inspection upon request? •The air conditioning (AC) system in my 2018 Honda Civic has malfunctioned. Initially, the AC compressor failed and was replaced under warranty in 2018. However, the AC never functioned properly afterward. Recently, the AC failed completely, and the dealership diagnosed a leaking evaporator. The vehicle is available for inspection upon request. 2.Safety Risk: •How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk? •The malfunctioning AC system poses a significant safety risk, especially considering the high temperatures in the Central Valley of California. Driving without a functional AC in extreme heat can lead to driver fatigue, reduced concentration, and potential heat-related illnesses, increasing the risk of accidents. 3.Problem Reproduction: •Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? •Yes, the problem has been confirmed by an authorized Honda dealership. They diagnosed the issue as a leaking evaporator and provided a repair estimate of $2,520.16. 4.Inspection by Others: •Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives, or others? •The vehicle has been inspected by an authorized Honda dealership, which diagnosed the issue. There have been no inspections by police or insurance representatives. 5.Warning Indicators: •Were there any warning lamps, messages, or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear? •There were no warning lamps or messages prior to the AC failure. The only symptom was the AC’s inability to cool the cabin effectively, which persisted since the initial compressor replacement in 2018 and culminated in complete failure recently.

The contact owns a 2018 Honda Civic. The contact stated while driving at an undisclosed speed, the steering wheel failed to function as intended. The contact stated that the steering wheel pulled slightly in the opposite direction and made a clicking sound. The vehicle was taken to the dealer several times for the failure; however, the failure could not be duplicated. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired by an independent mechanic or the dealer. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure but provided no assistance. The contact was informed that the repair was not covered under NHTSA Campaign Number: 18V663000 (Steering); however, the VIN was not associated with the recall. The failure mileage was approximately 45,000.
The steering wheel sticks & resists movement when traveling at highway speeds. It is resistant to minor steering corrections away from or toward center. This results in a jerky ride and movement when keeping within my lane.
At higher speeds, the steering wheel sticks when trying to maintain in a lane. You have to apply a little extra pressure to get the steering wheel to unstick and this causes the vehicle to swerve.
Steering feels rough. When traveling down highway, resistance is felt when trying to make steering adjustments right or left. The pressure required to make adjustments causes the car to weave, as each adjustment right or left requires pressure to overcome resistance.  I also have had steering bump against my input going around a corner.  This is a dangerous defect and is well documented. Honda should recall these defective electronic steering units.
I was first informed that there was a recall on my 2018 Honda Civic for a fuel system problem back in December 2023. When no information came from Honda USA as to when the dangerous problem would be repaired, I was told by the dealership that the repair would be completed at the latest by April. It is now the end of May and there still no word on when the Honda dealer will have the parts to repair the defect. The contact stated Honda finally fixed the 2018 Civic's faulty fuel pump.

Steering becomes sticky after the vehicle is warmed up. Traveling at highway speed ( 60 mph and above ) becomes challenging trying to correct for lane adjustments. The steering wheel feels or has a tighten spot from center both right or left directions. This causes an over correction while driving. Also there is a clicking sound when going though the sticky spot moving the wheel right or left.       This vehicle has 30k plus.  My Honda dealer denies knowing of any problems with the electronic steering in their vehicles.
The steering is sticky. It feels like play in the steering wheel. Gets worse when driving over 45 or 50. You have to over compensate when coming around curves and it pulls left. The car has been aligned in March and I attributed it to bad alignment. Took it back to dealer in June when it was getting worse. Diagnosed with faulty EPS.
The contact owns a 2018 Honda Civic. The contact stated while turning the steering wheel in either direction, the steering wheel would hold and pull in the opposite direction without warning. Additionally, an abnormal, clicking sound would emit from the steering wheel after driving for an extended period. The vehicle was taken to two separate independent mechanics where one found no issue with the vehicle and the other stated that there was an issue with the axle. The contact had a repair performed on the axle; however, the failure returned. Upon investigation, the contact discovered NHTSA Campaign Number: 18V663000 (Steering) which he linked to his failure. The manufacturer was notified of the failure but offered no assistance. The vehicle had yet to be repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 80,000.
Around 30-40k miles, the steering in my car started becoming notchy while driving and even at a stop. This is especially noticeable when driving on the highway when I'm trying to make small corrections to stay centered in the lane. On the highway, if I need to bring the car slightly to the right in a lane, rather than being able to smoothly turn the wheel to the right, it doesn't turn until a certain amount of force is applied and then it will move past that "Notch" and sometimes turn more than intended due to the excess force that I had to apply to get over the notchiness in the steering wheel. This has led to me almost hitting cars in the lane to my right.   I have not brought this issue to the dealership because my car is currently out of warranty. No indicators, messages, lights are showing on the dash. Based on the many other people who have this similar problem, it appears it may be due to a steering rack, as that is what the dealership has been replacing for other people who faced this problem.
The car had damage because in the carfax they gave me on the left side of the car the shock absorbers fail and I always had that problem also The moldings the first time I cleaned it also fell apart at the time to revere and turn to the right when it is going back it has such an annoying noise
Passenger front air bag not working. The air bag warning light has been coming on and off, over the last year.
2018 Honda Civic 2.0L Sedan bought in July 2018, starts to blow warm air from A/C from on October 2021, with only 50k miles on the car. Went to a mechanic for diagnosis since it was just over warranty and Honda dealer would charge $399 for just diagnosis and the only thing would be under cover is the condenser. The mechanic told me it is either a compressor leak or evaporator leak. I have read the comments online and it says the compressors and evaporator fail at a high rate due to bad design of the 10th gen Honda Civic A/C. I’ve also read that the condenser issue can lead to a compressor and evaporator leak. It is not a safety issue but it is unacceptable that a car which is only over 3 years with about 50k needs to be replaced the compressor or evaporator for over $1000.
I have 2018 Honda Civic only 30K+ mile and problem with AC. It’s not working and it’s dangerous to drive if I get fog inside vehicle. It’s hard to see outside. Also it’s not comfortable to sit and drive if too hot.I have breathing problems and I have put AC on. I called and they just said only condenser is covered any thing else for ac I have to pay.Which is not right.I checked too many people have same issues with AC
I JUST BOUGHT THIS CAR. THE PROBLEM HAPPENS AFTER YOU'VE BEEN DRIVING FOR A BIT ON THE HIGHWAY. THE STEERING STARTS TO STICK AND IT TAKES A BIT OF EFFORT TO TURN (LIKE IT'S STUCK) AND WHEN YOU DO END UP TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL, YOU OVERCORRECT. THIS IS EXTREMELY AGGRAVATING AND DOESN'T FEEL SAFE. ALSO, THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HONDA'S "LANE KEEP ASSIST." THIS PROBLEM DID NOT HAPPEN AFTER A 5 OR 10 MINUTE TEST DRIVE, OR I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THE CAR.   WHERE I LIVE IT'S FAIRLY HOT, SO HEAT MAY PLAY A FACTOR INTO THIS. THE PROBLEMS SEEMS MORE PRONOUNCED THE FASTER YOU GO. DEFINITELY MORE OF AN ISSUE DURING HIGHWAY DRIVING.
AIR CONDITIONER HAS STOPPED WORKING.  BLOWING OUT MUGGY OR HOT AIR INSTEAD OF COLD AIR. THIS HAPPENS WHEN BEING STATIONARY AND DRIVING ON ROADWAYS.   THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE TO DRIVER AND PASSENGERS.    IT WAS ALSO KNOW PROBLEM  TO HONDA AND THEY DID NOTHING TO TELL POTENTIAL BUYERS ABOUT THE KNOWN ISSUE.    THERE IS ALSO A CLASS ACTION SUIT. ACCORDING TO THE CLASS ACTION IT INVOLVES 2016-2018 HONDA CIVICS.    THE ONLY ACTION HONDA TOOK WAS EXTEND THE WARRANTY TO 10 YEARS AND UNLIMITED MILEAGE.  THEY NEVER NOTIFIED ME OF THIS WARRANTY.    I CALLED THE  DEALER AND THEY NEED TO DO A DIAGNOSTIC TEST BEFORE EVEN LOOKING AT THE AIR CONDITIONER.  FIRST WHY SHOULD THERE BE A DIAGNOSTIC TEST DONE.  NOTHING IN THE SERVICE BULLETIN (TSB) 19-091 CONCERNING A/C CONDENSERS THAT CAME FROM THE FACTORY DEFECTIVE IN 2016-2018  HONDA CIVICS NEVER MENTIONS A DIAGNOSTIC BE COMPLETED FIRST.   WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY FOR ANYTHING SINCE HONDA KNEW ABOUT THIS ISSUE!  THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL, AND REPAIR ISSUED TO DEALERS AT NO EXTRA COST TO THE CUSTOMER..  I HAVE ONLY HAD MY CAR FOR 2 YEARS.
WITHOUT WARNING OR WHEN I COME OUT TO MY CALL, ALL THE WINDOWS ARE ROLLED DOWN, AND THE SUNROOF IS OPEN. I HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT THIS IS AN OPERATOR ERROR AND THAT THE FUNCTION ON MY KEY FOB MUST HAVE BEEN ACCIDENTLY PRESSED. HOWEVER, THIS ISSUE HAS HAPPENED WHEN THE KEY FOB IS NOWHERE NEAR THE VEHICLE. THIS ISSUE HAS OCCURRED THREE TIMES AT HOME WHERE I KEEP THE KEY FOB AT LEAST 30 YARDS AWAY FROM THE VEHICLE. IN ADDITION, THE ISSUE HAS OCCURRED TWICE AT WORK WHERE THE VEHICLE IS OVER 50 YARDS AWAY AND MUST PASS THROUGH 1.5 FEET OF CONCRETE TO SEND A SIGNAL TO THE CAR.     IN ADDITION, THE NUMEROUS TIMES (I HAVE LOST COUNT) THE TRUNK WILL OPEN WITHOUT ACTIVATING THE KEY FOB OF DEPRESSING THE KNOB IN THE CAR. AGAIN, I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY DEALERS THAT IT IS OPERATOR ERROR. HOWEVER, EACH TIME THIS OCCURS, THE KEY FOB IS IN MY HAND ON THE WAY TO THE CAR OR IN THE CONSOLE AREA WHERE IT IS NOT BEING TOUCHED BY ME OR BY ANYTHING ELSE. IT HAS OCCURRED IN MY DRIVEWAY AND ONCE WHILE THE CAR WAS IN MOTION'CAUSING ME TO QUICKLY PULL OVER SO THE CONTENTS OF THE TRUNK DO NOT FLY OUT AND HIT SOMEONE.     BESIDES THE OBVIOUS SAFETY AND SECURITY ISSUE, THIS PROBLEM HAS CAUSED A GREAT DEAL OF WATER DAMAGE TO THE INTERIOR OF THE VEHICLE AND MAY HAVE GOTTEN INTO THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM VIA THE HANDS-FREE SYSTEM IN THE CONSOLE AND THE USB PORT IN THE CENTER COMPARTMENT'BOTH OF WHICH WERE COVERED IN WATER DURING THIS PAST INCIDENT WHEN IT WAS HEAVILY RAINING.     I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT THESE ARE FLUKES, AND HONDA HAS NOT AND WILL NOT MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO DISABLE THIS FEATURE. THE 200+ COMPLAINTS/REPORTS ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE INDICATES TO ME THAT IT IS NOT A FLUKE. AS THE OWNER, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE DISABLE THIS FEATURE SO FURTHER DAMAGES, SAFETY, AND SECURITY ARE NOT AN ISSUE. THE HONDA CIVIC IN QUESTION IS LESS THAN TWO YEARS OLD.
FRONT WINDSHIELD GET CRACKS VERY EASY,AFTER GETTING A SMALL STONE CHIP
WE PURCHASED A 2018 HONDA CIVIC SPORT HATCHBACK IN LATE SPRING OF LAST YEAR.   WHILE DRIVING IT IN SNOWY CONDITIONS, IT CONSISTENTLY COLLECTS SNOW AND ICE IN THE WHEEL WELLS TO THE POINT WHERE IT HAS ACTUALLY CAUSES DAMAGE TO THE INNER WHEEL WELL AND CAUSES CONSISTENT RUBBING AND BURNING SMELLS DUE TO THE ICE RUBBING AGAINST THE TIRE.   THE RESPONSE FROM THE DEALERSHIP (GARBER HONDA IN ROCHESTER) AND THE AUTO MANUFACTURER (AMERICAN HONDA FINANCE COMPANY) IS THAT THIS IS DUE TO 'OUTSIDE INFLUENCES' AND IS THEREFORE NOT COVERED BY THEM.    THE ISSUE IN QUESTION IS REGARDING THE MATERIAL DESIGN AND THE INABILITY TO ACTUALLY DRIVE THIS VEHICLE IN INCLEMENT WEATHER CONDITIONS IN WESTERN NEW YORK.    THE INNER WHEEL WELL IS MADE OF SOME TEXTURED, ALMOST 'CLOTH LIKE' MATERIAL THAT ALLOWS FOR SNOW AND ICE TO STICK AND BUILD UP VERY QUICKLY.   AFTER DRIVING JUST A FEW MILES IN SNOWY CONDITION, WE NEED TO PULL OVER TO TRY AND KNOCK SOME OF THE SNOW OFF SO THAT IT DOESN'T RUB AGAINST THE TIRE.   THE COLLECTION OF ICE AND NOW HAS ACTUALLY RIPPED OFF THE INNER WHEEL WELL ON ONE SIDE AND IS STARTING TO AFFECT THE OTHER SIDE.     I FEEL THAT THIS COULD BE A POTENTIAL ISSUE TO ANYONE DRIVING IN SNOW.   WHILE DRIVING UNDER THESE CONDITION, MY CONCERN IS FOR THE DRIVERS OF THIS VEHICLE AND OTHERS ON THE ROAD BECAUSE OF THE NEGATIVE WAY THAT IT AFFECTS THE HANDLING OF THE VEHICLE.      I HAVE SOUGHT OUT ADVICE FROM BOTH THE DEALERSHIP AND HONDA REGARDING ADDING DIFFERENT RIMS AND TIRES, BUT THEY HAVE COME BACK AND SAID THAT IT WOULD NOT AFFECT IT MUCH AND THAT IT WAS AN ENVIRONMENT ISSUE.   THE DEALERSHIP MENTIONED THAT THEY HAVE MANY PEOPLE COMING IN WITH THE SAME ISSUE AND CHARGES THEM EACH AND EVERY TIME TO HAVE THIS RESOLVED.     I DO HAVE A SMALL VIDEO THAT SHOWS EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS DOING TO THE VEHICLE.   IS THERE A LOCATION WHERE I CAN UPLOAD THIS?  I HAVE UPLOADED A PICTURE.
ON SEPTEMBER 15 2018 I WAS INVOLVED IN A SOLO VEHICLE CRASH I FELL ASLEEP AND HIT A PARKED VEHICLE DIRECTLY FROM BEHIND RESULTING IN ME BEING PROPELLED FORWARD INTO THE AIR BAG THAN PUSHED BACK BY THE AIRBAG IN THE SEAT...I WAS WEARING MY SEATBELT BUT THE SEAT BRACKET BENT FORWARD DURING COLLISION PUSHING ME INTO AIRBAG CAUSING SERIOUS CHEST CONTUSIONS AND INFLAMMATION OF LOWER BACK. AFTER THE CRASH SEAT COULD NOT BE MOVED FORWARD OR BACKWARD AS THE BRACKET WAS BADLY BENT. I WAS ABLE TO GET PICTURES OF MY VEHICLE FROM THE OUTSIDE AND WASH GOING TO RETURN TO PULL VEHICLE FROM TOW BUT HONDA PULLED IT OUT BEFORE I COULD AND ARE IN POSSESSION OF THE VEHICLE.
While driving on interstate vehicle lost power had to weave through traffic to get to pull off lane. Honda dealership states Replace the flywheel, pressure plate, friction disc (Clutch), and release bearing. car has 40k miles.
Steering wheel is “ sticky “ at highway speeds and causes over correction. Honda is aware of the issue with other year models ( and has issued recalls ). Dealer has diagnosed and quoted $6,000 to repair. This is ridiculous, to rob customers on the repair of an obvious issue. Recall is needed for all models with this same steering system. Serious safety issue !
While driving highway speeds the vehicles steering becomes sticky or gets momentarily hard to move. Have to use force to correct while moving lanes and or going around a bend.

Hello, I received a recall notification for my 2019 Honda Civic in May 2024. The recall notice states the fuel pump module may have been an improperly molded impeller. The recall is dated May 2024, I called the Markley Honda dealership in Fort Collins Colorado where I purchased the car and was told they did not have the parts yet. It is now mid October and I have called numerous times including yesterday to be told they still do not have parts. I am very concerned that this has not been fixed in a timely fashion. In the recall it states the car could stall during driving increasing risk of crash or injury. Thank you, [XXX]  [XXX]  [XXX]  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
Steering wheel sticks and is more noticeable at speeds over 50 mph which results in the car feeling jerky in curves and could cause the vehicle to swerve out of lanes or off the road.
The Carr some times breaks self and the gasoline not passing through the engine
Recall on fuel pump; multiple dealers do not have the replacement piece, they say “you can but don’t call other dealers.” I made an appointment over the phone to fix said recall, finally a dealer didn’t say they were out of the part.  I show up. It’s a joke. No parts available. “We’ll send a notice in the mail” They aren’t “helpful” Honda people. They physically told me, you have to wait for a problem to happen with this recall and maybe we’ll prioritize you. Basically it’s a lottery if this will be fixed, and it’s only most likely if you get hurt.  They’re waiting for accidents to happen to HAVE to fix the cars. Excuses do not save lives, taking cars with issues off the road does. It’s may 19th 2024 and this recall allegedly occurred 12/18/24
Steering wheel sticks on left turns, has been doing this for a while and Honda dealer can’t find issue. On highway, in turns, parked as well. Forums show plenty of others with this issue on their civics equipped with Honda Sensing years 2016-2024+. One had a steering rack replaced under warranty. I was encouraged to make a report on here by plenty of the members.
this seems like a safety risk that should have a solution by now
I was driving on a relatively hot day around 85F and the car AC was working fine but in the course of 30 min the ac started blowing hot air on my face while I was driving on freeway. The temperature was set to 69F but it still kept blowing hot air. After a while it started giving me a headache and I had to turn it off. I got it checked by Honda dealership and there is an Evaporator leak in the car confirming why I got a headache. This is a safety risk to the passengers of the vehicle as high concentrations of the ac refrigerant can leak in the car potential poisoning or making the driver loose consciousness and loose control of the car causing an accident. The problem has been confirmed by the dealership as there is an extended warranty for the condenser due to the high pressures of the newer refrigerant causing holes in condenser and evaporator but there is NO extended warranty for the evaporator which poses a greater risk to the drivers than the condenser since the part is inside of the cabin.
I have noticed steering wheel stiffness/notchiness when traveling at varying road speeds. The issue is present when turning the wheel left and it takes more force than usual to return the wheel back to the normal position with audible clicks/groans heard when turning/returning the wheel to neutral. During highway driving, it takes more effort than usual to maintain the vehicle within the lane, like the car is fighting against you. I brought the car into the dealership while still in warranty and the vehicle was misdiagnosed as a sway bar coupler link issue. Having completed their repair recommendations, the issue still persisted and I brought the car back for further evaluation. The car is now out of warranty, and the dealership is stating it is an electric issue with the EPS. The way the part is engineered, the entire EPS rack must be replaced which would cost me upwards of $4200. I will be in contact with corporate Honda in regards to this, as the issue was brought to their attention while the car was under warranty, misdiagnosed, and now I am expected to pay out of pocket for the repair out of warranty. This issue has only gotten worse as time progressed and I am becoming increasingly concerned about my safety and anyone who drives my vehicle due to a manufacturer defect. Research online through the NHTSA website as well as other Honda Civic Forums show hundreds, if not thousands of other Civic owners experiencing the same issue I am and being expected to pay out of pocket for this manufacturer defect.  I urge the NHTSA to take action and demand Honda to recall this product as it clearly stems from an engineering fault, not the consumer, and poses a massive safety risk to anyone driving a 2016-2021 Honda Civic.
The contact owns a 2019 Honda Civic. The contact stated that while driving at an undisclosed speed, the vehicle lost motive power. The vehicle was towed to an independent mechanic, who diagnosed that the fuel pump was faulty and needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure but provided no assistance. The failure mileage was approximately 62,000.
The contact owns a 2019 Honda Civic Sedan. The contact stated the AC unit was blowing hot air through the vents. The contact stated no warning light was illuminated. The contact took the vehicle to a local dealer, where it was diagnosed with needing the AC compressor to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired but was pending repairs. The manufacturer had been informed of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 43,000.
The power steering didn't work. There were warning messages displayed for Tire Pressure Monitor Problem, Adaptive Cruise Control Problem, Lane Keeping Assist Problem, Brake System Problem, Brake Hold System Problem, Power Steering System (EPS) Problem, Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) Problem, Hill Start Assist Problem, Collision Mitigation System Problem, Road Departure Mitigation System Problem when turning the car on. This condition was verified by the dealer on both occurrences. First occurrence was 6/8/21. It was towed to Spreen Honda dealer in Corona, CA. According to the the first invoice dated 6/8/21 for the repair there was "Confirmed fault code for C1420 main torque sensor and sub torque sensor, C1421-14 malfunction to steering angle, confirmed multiple fault codes due to rodent damage to the steering system sub harness chewed thru replaced the steering torque sensor sub harness and calibrated the steering angle sensor, cleared fault code now OK." Same problem occurred 7/8/2021. Taken to Spreen Honda again on 7/9/21. Wire harness again replaced, steering angle sensor replaced and power steering calibration performed. I have the wire harness that was replaced. Service advisor stated this is a problem with Honda wire harnesses because the insulation on the wires is soy based. He has seen it many times, including one customer at Riverside dealer who had rodents eat his wire harness four times while he was working there.  Not having operational power steering makes driving the vehicle very difficult and potentially dangerous.
I WAS DRIVING ON AN EMPTY ROAD WITH SPEED LIMIT 40 MPH.  IT WAS 2:30 PM WITH SUNNY CONDITIONS.  THE CAR STARTED BEEPING AND THEN THE CAR'S BRAKES AUTOMATICALLY ENGAGED VIOLENTLY.   THERE WAS NO CAR, PEOPLE, ANIMAL, DEBRIS ANYWHERE IN FRONT OR TO THE SIDE OF ME.  IT IS AN UNSAFE CONDITION BECAUSE A CAR COULD HAVE BEEN BEHIND ME AND REAR ENDED ME BECAUSE OF THE SUDDEN BRAKING.
THIS CAR WAS JUST RELEASED FROM BEING 'FIXED,' AT THE DEALERSHIP.  THE DAY AFTER THE CAR STALLED ON THE HIGHWAY NEARLY CAUSING AN ACCIDENT.  THE CAR HAS THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS SINCE 5000 MILES AND IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN A NEW CAR.  IT'S A LEMON.    1.  ENGINE CYLINDERS FLOODED WITH COOLANT   2.  ENGINE NOT WORKING   3.  DASHBOARD COMPUTER FLASHING ALL SYSTEMS FAILURE (SINCE 30 DAYS AFTER CAR WAS PURCHASED IN 11/2019.  NEVER RESOLVED).  4.  HEATER NOT WORKING.  ENTIRE AC SYSTEM REPLACED.  THEY ALSO SAID SOME VALVE HAD GONE OUT AS WELL.  THAT'S NEVER BEEN MADE CLEAR TO ME IN SPITE OF REPEATED INQUIRIES.  5.  CAR OUT OF SERVICE SINCE FEB 23 TO DATE.  HONDA CORPORATE HAS TOLD ME TO POUND SAND.  TO GO MAKE A LEMON LAW COMPLAINT.
THE STEERING WHEEL REEL ASSEMBLY MAKES A CLICK SOUND WHICH IS AN IN DICTATION OF INADEQUATE LUBRICATION. THE ASSEMBLY ITSELF CAN NOT BE RELUBRICATED AS THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY IS SEALED. HONDA WOULD NEED TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE PASTY THE INCORPORATES THE ASSEMBLY. HOWEVER, TECHNICIANS ARE STATING THAT THIS IS UNNEEDED AND NORMAL PART OF THE CAR.  THIS IS IN ACTUALITY, UNTRUE AND CAN BE ULTIMATELY DANGEROUS FOR THE DRIVER.
While driving down the road my steering wheel locks or sticks then quickly releases causing me to overcorrect the steering wheel. This happens on a continuous basis while driving. There are no warning lights or messages that come on. I took it to dealership for a diagnostics and they determined it to be the steering gear box but not considered a a recalled item.
UNKNOWN
Received 2 letters regarding fuel pump module and that parts are now available. However, contacted 3 dealerships and Honda National and now being told parts are unavailable till end of the year. Though I have option to have part replaced elsewhere are reimbursed for only part of expense. Problem ongoing since February 2024. I feel Honda is dropping the ball on this safety recall and someone needs to step in to ensure Honda complies and corrects issue asap and not make consumers wait another 10 months.
Gas door opens randomly and it’s happened more than a few times now which is becoming a safety hazard especially because I drive 80 miles daily for work. Also my automatic brake senor is a hazard because it’s going off when cars or objects are farther away; which leads to the 3rd issue with my seat belts which is either to tight on the chest area and possibly choking me when the car automatically brakes when objects aren’t near or in close distance to my car
The contact owns a 2020 Honda Civic. The contact stated while driving approximately 35 MPH, there was an abnormal odor coming from the A/C. The contact stated that there was a dangerous chemical called R1234YF leaking into the cabin of the vehicle. The contact stated that the odor from the leak made his daughter sick. No warning light was illuminated. The vehicle was taken to the dealer and diagnosed with a leak through the evaporator in the cabin as well as a leak in the condenser and compressor. The vehicle was not repaired due to cost.  The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 49,000.
The contact owns a 2020 Honda Civic. The contact stated that while driving at various speeds, the vehicle was drifting to the left. There was no warning light illuminated. The contact stated that after a while, the contact started to hear an abnormal ticking sound coming from the vehicle. The contact took the vehicle to a dealer and was informed that the power steering rack was defective and needed to be replaced; however, the part needed for the repair the vehicle was on backorder. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was unknown. The VIN was not available.
When driving at highway speeds with adaptive cruise control, vehicle will slow down or brake without any object/vehicle ahead. This usually occurs at curves, with no vehicles in current lane.  I would then need to immediately step on the acceleration in order to continue highway speeds. This may cause unnecessary stress on the vehicle due to constant issue occurrence. At times, a blinking warning message from the emergency braking system will appear on the dashboard during these conditions.  This causes a safety issue because cars in the back will not expect braking/slowing down when there isn't any obstruction from all perspectives. This is dangerous on the highway due to the increased driving speeds of surrounding vehicles.  I have not taken it to the dealer due to the vehicle being out of warranty, however it has always had this issue. Vehicle was bought new at dealership.
In early October 2021, my inforainment display screen stooped working. As a consequence, my rear view, and right side view cameras no longer show on the display screen. This has become a safety issue for me because I cannot see if other vehicles are in the right lane when I am planning to change to the right lane, or planning to make a right turn. Also, I can no longer rely on my rear view camera when I am trying to back out of a parking spot, or my driveway.  I took my car back to the dealer, and they told me that this HAS NOT been reported by other 2020 Honda Civic owners. They also told me that they need to order the part to repair it, but that it will take 2-6 weeks for the part to arrive. It has now been over 12 weeks and the part has not arrived. During the past 12 weeks, there were a few times where other drivers had to blow their horns at me as I tried to pass into the right lane. I have also had a few close encounters with pedestrians while I was backing out of a parking lot in shopping centers. Have any other 2020 Honda Civic owners reported problems with their infotainment display screens not working?  Thank you
OUR PASSENGER SEAT AIRBAG DOES NOT WORK WHEN I SIT IN THE SEAT. OUR  HONDA DEALER HAS SAID THERE COMPUTER DOES NOT SEE A PROBLEM WE DETERMINED THAT I MAY NOT MEET THE WEIGHT ALLOWANCE AS I WEIGH ABOUT 88-90 LBS. WE HAVE COMPLAINED TO THE AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR COMPANY AND WERE TOLD THEY WOULD GET BACK TO US BUT THAT WAS NEARLY A MONTH AGO.. ALL OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE SAT IN THE PASSENGER SEAT DID NOT EXPERIENCE THIS PROBLEM AND WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED CLEAR INFORMATION AS TO WHAT THE WEIGHT ALLOWANCE IS FOR THIS CAR. WHEN I SIT IN THE SEAT, THE AIRBAG LIGHT STAYS ON. I AM EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT HONDA'S APPARENT INDIFFERENCE AS WELL AS THE LACK OF SAFETY I FEEL WHEN SITTING IN THAT SEAT. PLEASE LET ME KN OW IF YOU CAN FOLLOW UP ON THIS CONCERN FOR ME. THANK YOU.
MY CAR WAS BROKEN INTO WHILE PARKED IN A PUBLIC PARKING LOT. THE 2020 CIVIC HAS A FEATURE WHERE ALL WINDOWS ROLL DOWN IF YOU PUT THE KEY INTO THE DRIVER'S DOOR LOCK AND TURN IT TO THE RIGHT. ACCORDING TO HONDA OF OAKLAND SERVICE CENTER, SOMEONE USED A SCREWDRIVER TO ACTIVATE THIS FEATURE, WHICH IN TURN ROLLED THE WINDOWS DOWN AND THEY WERE ABLE TO ACCESS THE TRUNK LATCH NEAR THE DRIVER'S SEAT AND STEAL ITEMS FROM MY TRUNK. THEY WERE THEN ABLE TO ROLL THE WINDOWS BACK UP USING THE SAME FEATURE (TURNING TO THE LEFT) AND I WAS NOT AWARE THAT THERE WAS A BREAK IN UNTIL LATE THE NEXT DAY WHEN I WENT TO RETRIEVE ITEMS FROM THE TRUNK.     A RELATED FEATURE IS THAT THE KEY FOB ALLOWS YOU TO ROLL DOWN ALL WINDOWS SIMULTANEOUSLY BY HOLDING DOWN THE UNLOCK BUTTON. THIS FEATURE IS VERY SENSITIVE AND CAN BE ACTIVATED IN A POCKET OR PURSE. I TESTED OUT THE RANGE OF THE FEATURE AND WAS ABLE TO ROLL MY WINDOWS DOWN REMOTELY FROM OVER 200 FEET AWAY WHILE INSIDE A BUILDING WHEN MY CAR WAS PARKED OUTSIDE ACROSS THE STREET. I TWICE CAME BACK TO MY CAR WITH THE WINDOWS ROLLED DOWN DUE TO THIS FEATURE WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE.     THESE REMOTE WINDOW FEATURES POSE A SERIOUS SAFETY THREAT FOR CONSUMERS IN URBAN AREAS, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE DOOR FEATURE CAN EVIDENTLY BE ACTIVATED WITH JUST A SCREWDRIVER, AND THE KEY CAN BE ACTIVATED FROM HUNDREDS OF FEET AWAY. NOT ONLY CAN PEOPLE BREAK INTO MY CAR WITHOUT ANY EQUIPMENT, BUT IT IS NOT EVIDENT FROM THE OUTSET THAT A BREAK-IN OCCURRED BECAUSE THE FEATURE ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO ROLL ALL THE WINDOWS BACK UP REMOTELY. THIS MAKES THE MODEL AN EASY TARGET FOR FUTURE THEFT, AND I HAVE ALREADY HAD TO FILE A CLAIM WITH MY INSURANCE TO REPAIR THE MECHANICAL DAMAGE TO THE LOCK/DOOR RESULTING FROM THIS BREAK IN.
Steering wheel sticks once at highway speed, wheel turns but with a glitch
There’s been a safety recall and I took my car like more than a year ago to repairs and then the check the car but told me the piece it’s not ready yet. I have to wait almost a whole year for it and I receive the notification that the piece was ready. When I call to make the appointment the lady told me that I receive the notification but the piece it’s not on the Honda yet and I have to wait. Wait more ? I’m seriously concerned about my car and even though I receive the notification that it’s ready she says they haven’t receive the piece yet ? This is a serious matter and my car and even my family we are driving the car and this is absolutely not ok.  I don’t know how much more do I have to wait.
The front sensor is too sensitive. If there is another car using a turn lane, the Civic will try to brake and will not pass the car. If another car is ahead on a curve, the automatic braking kicks in. This tends to only happen when using cruise control. It is dangerous on the freeway. The sudden braking could cause me to be rearended. I've been lucky, so far, and have only received dirty looks from the drivers that were behind me as they passed. Since it doesn't happen every single time, there seems no way to reproduce it. No one has inspected it for defects. No warning lights, beeps or messages appear before the braking starts. This has been happening since I first bought the car in 2022, but seems to be more frequent now. Probably the reason it was returned... in my opinion.
I'm experiencing “sticky steering.” I feel momentary increases in steering effort while driving the vehicle at highway speeds. I fear that I may over correct one day and cause an accident.
Automatic Emergency braking has gone off twice in 1 month on it's own. No car in front of me and the brakes went off and the "BRAKE" light went off on the dashboard. Yes, my safety was put at risk. I am not seeing any recalls for this Honda but I have read that this is an ongoing problem.
Sticky Steering & Fluctuating Steering Torque. Car loses control due to this steering problem. There was a recall for this problem (SJS 2022-25 Civic EPS Grbx Greasing Saf Rec). Dealer repaired the recall but the issue came after short period of time. So the the repair was not done properly.
The contact owns a 2022 Honda Civic. The contact received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 24V744000 (Steering); however, the part to do the recall repair was not yet available. The local dealer was contacted. The contact stated that the manufacturer had exceeded a reasonable amount of time for the recall repair. The manufacturer was made aware of the issue. Parts distribution disconnect.
The contact owns a 2022 Honda Civic. The contact stated that while driving at an undisclosed speed, the EPS warning light illuminated. After a visual inspection of the engine compartment, the contact observed an oil leak coming however, the location of the leak was unknown. The vehicle was not taken to the dealer or an independent mechanic. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure, a case was opened, and the contact was referred to the NHTSA Hotline for assistance. The failure mileage was approximately 16,000. The VIN was not available.
Car has been exhibiting sticky steering problem. Small adjustments require above average force to keep centered and the car ends up over compensating.
While driving the wheel moved trying to correct itself. It was raining so that caused us to hydroplane into a ditch.
My car which is less than 3 years old has faulty electronic power steering assembly. I took the car to Honda service and they confirmed that its faulty and needs replacement. I was quoted $3500 to fix it since im out of warranty. Contacted Honda Motor corporation and they refused to help me get this replaced. Steering get stuck on the highway speed while going around curves and makes it very difficult to break loose from the stuck position. I almost got into an accident while trying to break loose from the stuck position. My service representative confirmed that all 2022-2023 has this issue or will have this issue as the milage goes up. In my case i always had this issue but i thought it was the lane keep assist feature that is correcting itself. This vehicle needs to be recalled for the power steering.
Steering becomes hard to make adjustments after about 15 min of driving, and makes a noticeable noise when turning
I'm encountering a sticky sensation in the steering wheel, accompanied by clunking noises when I turn it. This poses a significant safety concern, particularly during highway driving, as it impairs my ability to maintain smooth control of the vehicle. The issue persists even when driving off the highway.
What component or system failed or malfunctioned, and is it available for inspection upon request? Steering system, it is available for inspection.   How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk? While driving at highway speeds, the steering is sticking and requires effort/driver input to keep the car straight. While making correction, the steering seems to take additional force to get it to respond.  Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? No Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others? No Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear? No
The steering wheel sticks about 70% of the time I drive the car. I have to use more pressure to make minor adjustments than normal. I'm guessing it's the steering rack or something similar. It takes my focus away from other things I should be paying attention to while driving. I need this fixed ASAP.
Vehicle has "sticky / notchy" steering when driving above 40mph, issue worsens with higher speed. Any minor adjustment make to the steering just to stay in the lane, steering gets very tight and when extra force is applied to move steering wheel it then releases and causes overcorrection. Issue especially dangerous when going around a long sweeping turn or corner, steering will get so tight the steering wheel gets stuck, to the degree that you can let your hand off the steering wheel entirely and the wheel stays in the turned position on its own. Tightness progressively getting worse over time.
Having problems with the steering wheel, while driving my car, the steering wheel gets stiff and it is hard to maneuver causing the vehicle to pull. I feel very unsafe driving my vehicle on the road.  I received a recall noticed, therefore I took my car to dealership but was informed that my car was not under recall, but was informed that I needed to replace the steering gearbox. I don't understand why my vehicle doesn't show as having a recall if I am having the same issue mentioned on the current steering rack recall. I have been waiting for my car to get fixed for over a month; the dealership is waiting for parts.  Meanwhile I have to drive my vehicle with this problem because the dealership will not provide a rental due to vehicle's recall status.
Steering sticks at highway speeds causing over corrections. This causes me to have to constantly make adjustment just to maintain lane.
The Steering on my Vehicle is sticky at moderate to high Speeds! Whenever im driving and i need to make small corrections, the steering sticks causing me to have to apply more force to the Steering Wheel to overcome the Stickiness which then is causing my Vehicle to swerve slightly, i believe under the right circumstances that can become dangerous! Honda dealer was Notified, inspection was carried out by said Honda Dealer. I was informed the part that needs to be replaced is on Backorder and won’t be in for a COUPLE MONTHS! No Loner Vehicle was offered, the Dealership informed me that they are well aware of the Problem and that the Vehicle is safe to drive. No warning Lamps are illuminated at the Time the Sticky Steering is occurring.
Steering wheel is sticking at speeds greater than 40 MPH. This has been an on-going issue for several months, but over the last week it has been getting worse. The incident that has prompted this complaint occurred while driving this evening on the interstate. I moved to pass an 18-wheeler while entering a slight curve in the lanes. The steering wheel failed to respond as it should have, and I felt as if I could have been in an accident. It isn't that I could not turn at all, but the extra effort I had to use on the wheel in order to navigate only a modest curve in the scared me in that particular situation. Since it is getting worse, I have to say I'm not fully confident of my safety while driving this car. I feel this for two reasons: first, I have no idea when or where the problem might present itself, or to what degree of effort I will need to put into the wheel; and second, I feel at some point I will overcompensate and either hit another vehicle or drive into a skid. I have taken the vehicle to the dealer, but I am not certain they even test-drove the car. The invoice states it operates as normal, which means they could not have test-drove it. I described my issue in detail, even showed them the complaints on the NHTSA website, and I was told that Honda did not have a solution for the problem. There are no warning lamps present, and the vehicle is available for inspection for anyone who wants to inspect it.
I was making a right turn the steering wheel stuck & I hit a curb causing significant damage. Honda says it’s not from recall & won’t pay for any of it $4600 to repair it. It was clearing from the steering being sticky.
I’ve been having issues few months after I bought the car from Honda dealership. I took it back and forth to them and they said there was an issue but did nothing. The recalls about the steering came up and I don’t feel safe driving the car but last week I took it and they said there was nothing wrong.  Steering is sticky. I’m all over the road having to make corrections 90% of the time I’m driving. Without the lane assist it does it. With the lane assist on the car won’t even stay straight due to the problem.  its very unsafe & aggravating to own a car paying so much a month for a newer car and with issues. An alignment was done and the steering wheel cannot be put straight even.   It’s definitely a safety problem.  Honda wants to do nothing about it due to parts and labor being $2800 and change and they’d be losing money it’s my thought.  Thinking about doing lemon law because it’s very unsafe to drive the car and it’s rare when the car shows no problem at all.  I shouldn’t have to make corrections the whole time I’m driving.
When starting my car, it struggles to start and then the emissions system light stays on, warning of engine power being affected. The car sputters when driving. The lane departure light stays on, as well as the braking system light, which warns of potential problems with braking.   My safety is at risk when trying to accelerate and sputtering instead. Since the problem started today, December 22, I can’t go to the dealer until after Christmas. No one else has inspected the vehicle yet.   There were no other warnings, however steering did feel strange, starting a couple of days ago.
The steering sticks when traveling at high rates of speed, on highways traveling between 60 - 75 mph. The steering sticks continuously at the high rates of speed on highways after traveling for an hour or so. A slight jerk on the steering wheel will correct the issue, but the sticking seems to get slightly harder to correct the longer the car is driven. The obvious safety issue is over correcting when the steering sticks could put the car and passengers in to other traffic, a retaining wall, ditch, etc. Another concern for safety is the sticky steering that gets harder to correct the longer the car is driven at high rates of speed, very likely, will become stuck and not allow the driver to control the steering at all.  Honda dealership in Moss Point, Mississippi did a safety check for the power steering rack recall by Honda, and was made aware of the sticky steering and was given the instructions to detect the malfunction, but stated they did not notice anything wrong. To actually detect the malfuction, some time must be spent on the highway at more than 60 mph. The brief driving of the vehicle on a street riddled with traffic lights, for a few miles,  by a technician, then returning to the dealership would not expose the issue. The test given was inadequate,  and therefore inaccurate.
The dealership service center has inspected my vehicle twice. The first time I was notified that the part was placed on back order and there was an unsure date of when parts were to be released. This occurred a few days after the recall notification on 10/19.  I received a phone call from the dealership stating that my car is unsafe to drive and still waiting on parts to come in. The same day 11/14, I was given a loaner vehicle. 7 days later I was notified that the part had arrived and the dealership was going to begin repairs. I assumed that my car was going to be fixed. The dealership inspected my car again and I received a phone call on 11/25 that my vehicle does not qualify under the recall stated above. On top of that, they informed me that they were still waiting on the part. I am unhappy with the lack of knowledge from the dealership about the matter and the amount of misinformation I’ve received about the status and qualification for the recall. I have noticed sticking in the steering wheel for months prior to finding out about the recall. I would have pointed it out much sooner if I would have known how serious this is. Apparently it is serious enough that I am unable to drive the car but not serious enough for Honda to recognize the recall and pay for the repairs or obtain the parts in a timely manner. I am highly dissatisfied with the lack of ability to problem solve this safety issue.
While driving at a slight angle to the left, the steering wheel sticks.   It seems to happen the most often going uphill at moderate speed, though can happen at any point.   The sticking has varying degrees of severity. While not extremely dangerous it could be. It is a constant, unprovoked issue and requires that it be adjusted to maintain a safe line.
2022 Honda Civic. When driving on highway or residential roads even the steering sticks and locks up. Having to put alot of effort into correcting causing an over correction and possible accident. Called Honda and had it towed to the shop. ITS NOT SAFE.   This has happened on many occasions, it just gets worse with time. Happened not just 10/18.
The power steering locks every so often and I have to forcefully maneuver the wheel and unlock it as I am driving
I bought a new 2022 civic touring. As of approximately 3000 miles into driving the vehicle, I noticed steering issues at lower road speeds of 30-45 miles per hour. The steering was "catching" when the steering wheel was oriented at 12 o'clock. I immediately took it to a dealership and demanded they drive the vehicle and I told them the steering rack needed to be replaced. At first they agreed with me that the mechanical rack itself was the problem; however, after further investigation, they discovered the problem was with the Hitachi-made ECU (electronic control unit) with the power steering system. I waited 7 months for this repair. I demanded the dealership foot the bill for my rental car for the duration of this time, and they did. The part was back-ordered because it is Japanese, and assembled in China. It is a relatively advanced semiconductor microchip, hence the wait. The part nomenclature is "Steering Gearbox, Electric Power Steering." I have put 3000 miles on the vehicle since it was repaired, and have not noticed any lingering symptoms of the initial problem. Car steering appears healthy. DEMAND that the repairing party honors the warranty. This is an expensive repair that dealerships do not want to pay for, according to most forums relating to this issue. Therefore, they are waiting for Honda to issue a recall, which will never happen due to the low number of problem cases. Mine is the only case of this repair being done satisfactorily that I have found online. Good luck guys.
The TPMS (tire pressure monitoring system) never illuminated to let me know I had a flat tire, and still didn't illuminate even after the entire tread was ripped off the sidewall of the tire.  The front left tire was the one that went flat, and had I not been astute to the vehicles behavior, I could have been in a severe accident, as it is a front tire.  I noticed the car pulling left a little, but thought it was due to the construction being done to repave the highway. After about 10 minutes of driving, I felt and heard the thumping of a flat tire. I had to drive a few miles to safely exit the highway when I heard the loud bang of the tread separating from the rim and hitting the underside of the car and wheelwell.  For the tread to have been completely sheared off, I must have been driving on a flat for a considerable amount of time.  The entire time, the TPMS never illuminated to warn of a flat or of low tire pressure.  When I got to the dealership, the service writer told me the TPMS doesn't warn of a blowout. I found that to be a strange comment, because I clearly didn't have a blowout.  The car was pulling for a little while (over 10 minutes), and then it started the notorious thumping of a flat tire before the tread eventually ripped apart.  I couldn't find anywhere in the 2022 Honda Civic Sedan owners manual that states anything to support the service writer. Only that it measures even tire pressure, which it obviously wouldn't have had, so the TPMS should have come on.   Even if the TPMS didn't warn prior to a flat, I think it should have illuminated when the tread totally separated from the sidewall of the tire, and it did not.  I sat with the car running for at least 20-25 minutes after getting off the highway, and it still never illuminated.   From what the Ray Price Honda dealership service writer said, it didn't record any errors either.
I purchased a 2022 Civic Sports brand new, in 11/21, and it recently broke down; it is less than two years old and has 14,216 miles. The engine failed, and it broke down in the middle of the highway, and luckily I was able to pull over to safety before being hit by a car. Oil and anti-freeze were leaking out of the vehicle. I called Honda roadside assistance, and the tow driver stated that this was a brand-new car, and it sounded like the rods and engine were knocking. It was towed to a dealership, and they told me it was a metal piece in the machine the technician found. It was a manufacturing defect, and then when I inquired more because I felt replacing an engine on a new car was insufficient because of component issues that could be affected due to the damage. I purchased a new vehicle for the peace of mind. I also purchased during the time of covid and the car shortage. The car was fresh from the manufacturer, and I had to pay extra due to the need. The car was maintained with oil and maintenance from the Honda dealership I purchased the car from. I did not see a recall for my vehicle, and there were no warnings. I had to car services a month and a half before. I have asked for something in writing to see the metal piece, but the dealership is refusing, and they are trying to cover this issue up by issuing a quick fix with an engine.
First issue was a major evap leak that took several attempts and months for them to repair resulting in having to drive around with a check engine light. Reason this is concerning is that when the check engine light is on the advanced safety systems are disabled. They had to replace the gas tank fuel filler neck because it was not closing properly. I was told by Honda corporate that "this is not posing a significant risk to the occupants of the vehicle", but when fuel is not being properly contained in the tank, and the safety features don't work I think otherwise.  Now, there is a steering rack issue where at high speeds the steering is grabbing causing a possibility for overcorrection.  Honda has known about our issues since June of 2022 and Honda corporate has been delaying official lemon law claims since December of 2022 where I then hired an attorney. Honda corporate is now ignoring the attorney and our only recourse is to file a lawsuit. I can't in good conscience sell the car to endanger the public. My only concern is that there are so many of these falling apart on the road.
While traveling at highway speeds, the vehicle suddenly engaged emergency braking causing rapid reduction in speed. The vehicle repeated this multiple times almost causing an accident due to other vehicles behind and around the car.
The vehicle steering wheel locked up and several error warnings were displayed on the dashboard. We had to have the vehicle towed to the dealership.
My Honda civic steering wheel at around 14,000 miles began to be "sticky" after driving about 30 minutes when performing minor steering corrections. While driving at any speed, the steering wheel has a slight resistance to minor corrections which causes me to need to slightly jerk the steering to go the way I need it to go. This then causes the car to turn to far and the need for correction which also is a slight adjustment and the cycle continues. The dealer wasn't able to see the issue but it is a great pain and possible safety issue while going at highway speeds. There are no warning lights or error codes associated.
When driving, especially highway, the steering wheel tends to “stick” and a bit of extra pressure is needed to maintain the car straight. It is almost continuous on the highway, not as noticeable, but still present, at slower speeds
Steering feels sticky when trying to correct the steering wheel I’ve taking in to the dealer but they say they can’t replicate the problem
The steering wheel sticks while driving down the road.  Seems to be worse at speeds above 40.  There is a small catch / resistance from the middle position and then when you correct back the other way at the center point it catches or sticks again.
Sticky steering at highways speeds. Doesn’t feel safe on highway. Issue started at around 17k mileage.
The contact owns a 2022 Honda Civic. The contact stated that while operating the vehicle, the steering wheel was difficult to turn in either direction. The local dealer and manufacturer were notified of the failure and a service appointment was scheduled. The cause of the failure was not yet determined. The failure mileage was 25,000.
The car has 18K mikes and the steering sticks after driving for 30 minutes or so. It takes a slight jerk to get it unstuck and is a dangerous issue. It happens at highway speeds and slower speeds as well.
When I drive down the road at certain times the steering sticks which does not allow me to make the minor adjustments needed to stay in the center of a lane. This causes a jerkiness and overcorrection when driving at higher speeds.   This has occurred on long trips and short drives, but sometimes the steering seems fine. I have confirmed that it is not the lane assist kicking in. It is a problem with the steering wheel sticking.
one day after approximately 11k miles of use, the sterring began to bind. Sticking mainly to the center, at first it wasn't very drastic. A little extra effort & you were able to mussel through it. The more you drive it ghe worse it gets. It got to an unmanageable point with the lane assit on, as the car fights itself. this started approximately 3 & half weeks ago. Its getting worse. Had an appointment at tge dealer 2 weeks ago, yesterday there was a release date for my steering rack of January 1, mabye.  It gets worse w speed.
While driving, the steering wheel will stick and require extra effort to turn the wheel. While not currently life-threatening, this has all the potential to become fatal. There has been some reproductions at service centers, but my vehicle has not been inspected yet, and there are no warning lights or prompts.
The electrical system does not read my phone , my phone is an iOS device.   The lane departure is not accurate and it needs to be calibrated.
While driving on a interstate highway with adaptive cruise control enabled the adaptive cruise control system unexpectedly disabled itself. I was in the process of passing another vehicle, it was sunny and clear and suddenly I heard a long beep and the vehicle started to slow down. I briefly looked at the dashboard but see any warning but noticed ACC was off. Once it was safe again I attempted to re-enable ACC but the system refused saying ACC was off. At the next rest area I stopped and shut off the vehicle, only after that I could use ACC again.  It's unknown if any of the other Honda sense features were disabled but this unexpected behavior is a concern. There is an entire thread at https://www.civic11forum.com/threads/anybody-having-cruise-control-issues.963/ which indicates others are having the same issue.
ACC and normal Cruise control always stops or canceling while on driving on the freeway.
My wife thought she locked her keys in the car and I got a hanger to try and get in by putting hanger in window and pulling the latch for trunk and then pull the lever to fold down the back seat and then I crawled in from trunk and when I lifted the back seat to look on seat it latched and I was locked in car! I could not open any doors  or windows and it was very hot that day and it was even hotter inside the car. I thought I was gonna die! I was trying to yell but nobody was around and my son in law just happen to pull up and I was screaming beating on the window and he heard me and saw me and rushed over and I told him to pull the latch in trunk to open back seat and he found the latch and I was able to crawl out. I thought I was gonna die!! You cannot get out of that car if you are inside and the locks are locked. There was a time not long before that my wife and I went to store and she went in and I was gonna come in after I got done with my phone call I was on and when I tried to open the door it would not open and I had to wait for her to come out of store to unlock the car so I could get out. After this last incident I was so shaken up I didn't know what to do until my brother in law told me to file a complaint before it happens to someone else that might not get lucky like I did and to call an attorney which is what I'm gonna do regardless of what they do about it. I'm a grown adult and could not get out of that car and if that were to happen to a child I don't wanna even think about what would happen and that is why I'm making this complaint so it can be fixed before it happens again if it already hasn't.

TAKATA RECALL.    FIRST HONDA RECALL LETTER IN FEB, 2018.  "I-79" HONDA SUPPOSEDLY FIXED THE PROBLEM ON MARCH 5, 2018.  SECOND CARD-LETTER RECEIVED MAY 20, 2018.  I CALLED THE DEALER (I-79 HONDA), AND THEY SAID YES, INFLATOR NEEDED TO  BE REPLACED (AGAIN!!).   WHAT'S GOING ON HERE???
I NOTICE THAT MY HONDA 2010 ACCORD IS ON LIST FOR AIRBAG RECALL LIST FOR TAKATA INFLATOR. WITH NUMEROUS ATTEMPT TO FIX MY AIRBAG WITH DEL, THEY KEEP TELLING ME THAT MY VIN IS NOT ON THE LIST FOR RECALL. I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY MY CAR IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER 2010 MODEL. HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO DRIVE WITH POTENTIAL LIFE THREATING AIRBAGS IN MY CAR?
ALL 4 OF MY LOCK ACTUATORS HAVE GONE OUT IN ABOUT A 6 YEAR PERIOD OF TIME.  THEY WENT OUT INDIVIDUALLY APPROXIMATELY A YEAR APART.   THE PROBLEM STARTED WITHIN THE FIRST 3 YEARS OF OWNING THE CAR AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY.  HONDA DID COVER THE FIRST BUT REFUSED TO COVER THE OTHER 4.  I&#65039; HAD ASKED TO TO HAVE ALL OF THEM REPLACED INITIALLY AND WAS TOLD NO.  HONDA OBVIOUSLY BOUGHT A BATCH OF BAD LOCK ACTUATORS.  I HAVE OWNED 8 HONDA'S OVER THE LAST 35 YEARS AND HAVE NEVER HAD A SINGLE LOCK ACTUATOR GO OUT IN ANY HONDA I&#65039; HAVE EVER OWNED.
WHEN THIS PROBLEM FIRST HAPPENED THE CAR HAS A GRINDING NOISE AT COLD START CAR IS SITTING STILL, VEHICLE IS NOW  PRODUCING GRINDING NOISE AT START AND AT TAKE OFF, AT VARIOUS INTERVALS.  I HAVE RESEARCHED AND ADVISED BY A MECHANIC THIS IS CALLED THE VTC ACUATOR AND SEEMS TO BE COMMON IN 2008 TO 2011 HONDA ACCORD'S.
I CALLED HONDA CUSTOMER TO REPORT A PROBLEM DUE TO CONSTANT CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS AND  TO GET MY CAR CHECKED WITH A RECALL NOTICE . THEY TOLD ME I WILL CHARGED TO SEE WHETHER MY IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE RECALL NOTICE AND TOLD MY CHECK ENGINE PROBLEM CANNOT BE CHECKED OUT SINCE MY MFG WARRANTY EXPIRED SINCE IT IS ONLY GOOD FOR 6 YRS FROM THE YEAR OF MANUFACTURED DATE AND NOT THE SOLD DATE . I BOUGHT MY CAR 2011 SO MY WARRANTY IS STILL VALID , BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY ARE GOING BY MFG DATE AND SOLD DATE.
I TOOK MY CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP, HONDA CARS OF COLUMBIA, FOR THE AIR BAG RECALL WHICH WAS REPAIRED. I INFORMED THEM OF EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION AND OF ERROR CODES THAT APPEARED. THEY INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO WITHOUT ENGINE LIGHT ON. I CALLED HONDA CARS OF AMERICA AND AFTER GETTING THE RUN AROUND, THEY TOLD ME THAT MY VEHICLE WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THEIR CAMPAIGN FOR EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION AND UNDER ENGINE MISFIRE IF THE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN TO TAKE CAR TO DEALERSHIP AND THEY WOULD REPLACE SPARK PLUGS 1-4 AND UPDATE SOFTWARE. I HAVE A V6. THE CAR USES 2-4 QTS BETWEEN OIL CHANGES. ALL I'M ASKING FOR IS TO REPLACE ALL SPARK PLUGS AND UPDATE SOFTWARE. YOUR HELP IN THIS MATTER IS GREATLY APPRECIATED.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 HONDA ACCORD. THE CONTACT RECEIVED A RECALL NOTIFICATION FOR NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 16V346000 (AIR BAGS) AND STATED THAT THE PART NEEDED WAS UNAVAILABLE TO PERFORM THE RECALL REPAIR. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE ISSUE. THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE. PARTS DISTRIBUTION DISCONNECT.
TAKATA RECALL, MY COMPLAINT:.    MY RECALL 16V-346 HAS NOT BEEN INSTALLED IN A TIMELY MANNER.  IT HAS BEEN 4 WEEKS SINCE I HAVE RECEIVED MY LETTER AND CALLED MY HONDA DEALER (EASTCOAST HONDA IN MYRTLE BEACH, SC.)   PLEASE ADVISE TO EXPEDITE.
SINCE OIL CHANGE IN APRIL 2016, NEEDED TO ADD 3 1/3 QTS OF OIL IN LESS THAN 4K MILES.  NO OIL IS DRIPPING FROM CAR; NO INDICATOR LIGHT SHOWING OIL LOW.  TOOK TO GET DIAGNOSIS OF PROBLEM AND NO PROBLEM WAS FOUND. CURRENTLY GETTING AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST WITH HONDA SO THAT WE CAN GET EXTENDED WARRANTY.
MOON ROOF EXPLODED WHILE DRIVING ON HWY 15 IN 65 DEGREE WEATHER HERE IN SAN DIEGO.  SOUNDED LIKE A LOUD EXPLOSION. NO CARS WERE CLOSE TO ME.  ONLY THE MOON ROOF WAS AFFECTED, NO OTHER DAMAGE TO THE CAR ROOF OR ELSEWHERE.  CAR ONLY HAS 75,000.  I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER. !ST ALL OF MY DOOR LOCK FAILED, NO THIS!!
WHEN DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY ON MY WAY TO WORK THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  AFTER EXITING I CHECKED FOR ERROR CODES (AS I ALWAYS CARRY THE P-CODE READER WITH ME).  THE CODE STATED THAT CYLINDER 3 WAS MISFIRING.  I DOUBLE CHECKED ALL SPARK PLUGS TO MAKE SURE THE CONNECTIONS WERE OKAY.  THE ENGINE LIGHT CONTINUED TO COME ON, WITH A ROUGH IDLE, AND ENGINE CODES STARTED TO BE MORE SPONTANEOUS AS IT STATED RANDOM MISFIRES/MULTIPLE CYLINDER MISFIRES.  I TOOK MY CAR TO HONDA AND WAS TOLD THAT I LIKELY NEED TO REPLACE THE IGNITION COIL, SO I DID THAT AND STILL EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM.  I THEN TOOK IT TO A SHOP WHERE THEY ALSO SUSPECTED BAD IGNITION COILS.  THEY THEN DID A VALVE ADJUSTMENT AND WAS POSITIVE THAT WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM.  AFTER PERFORMING THAT JOB, THE CAR CONTINUED WITH THE SAME ROUGH IDLE BUT ONLY POPULATED THE ERROR CODE STATING CYLINDER 3 IS MISFIRING.  THEY TOOK OUT THE SPARK PLUG AND IGNITION COIL ON CYLINDER 3 AND DISCOVERED A CRACKED INTAKE VALVE.  I'VE SPOKEN TO AT LEAST 10 SHOPS, 2 HONDA SERVICE DEALERSHIPS, AND 2 PERSONAL MECHANIC FRIENDS THAT ALL STATE THAT A BROKEN INTAKE VALVE AT 107K IS VERY UNUSUAL AND LIKELY A RESULT OF POOR DESIGN.  I HAVE READ ABOUT THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FOR ALL V6 HONDA ACCORDS BETWEEN 2008-2012.  UNFORTUNATELY THE 2010 V6 6 MT IS ONE OF THE FEW MODELS LEFT OUT OF THAT LAW SUIT.  I HAVE ALREADY HAD A SHOP START ON THE REPAIRS AS I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO HAVE THEM DONE ASAP.  I FIGURE AN UNLIKELY EVENT LIKE THIS IS DUE TO POOR ENGINE DESIGN SINCE I HAVE THOROUGHLY KEPT UP WITH ALL SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE (SPARK PLUGS, TIMING BELT, WATER PUMP, OIL CHANGE, ETC..).  I FEEL THAT HONDA SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS 2000$ DOLLAR REPAIR.
SINCE CHANGING THE BRAKES AT 55000  MILES...I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS.

THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AND THE CAR MAKES NOISE AND DRIVING IS NOT SMOOTH.  WHEN I CONTINUED TO DRIVE IT TO THE DEALER THE VSA, AND THE WRENCH CAME ON.  THEY DID A DIAGNOSTIC AND SAID IT WAS A SPARK PLUG MISS FIRING.  I DROVE MY CAR TO GEORGIA AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED WHILE I WAS ON THE ROAD AND HAD TO HAVE IT FIXED THERE.  NOW IT IS DOING THE SAME THING ONE MONTH LATER.  I WILL BE TAKING IT TO THE DEALER TO HAVE IT CHECKED.  I FOUND ON THE INTERNET THAT THEIR IS A CLASS ACTION SUIT FOR THE SAME THING.  IT IS RESOLVED WHEN THE PUT A NEW MOTOR IN THE CAR.  MY CAR DOES NOT LEAK OIL BUT READS THAT THE OIL IS LOW.  THE OIL LIGHT DOES NOT COME ON WHEN THIS HAPPENS.  I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE CAR FIXED BUT NOT CONTINUALLY AT MY EXPENSE.  *TR
TL*  THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 HONDA ACCORD. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 20 MPH THE CONTACT NOTICED A METALLIC SNAPPING SOUND COMING FROM THE FRONT END OF THE VEHICLE. THE SOUND COULD BE HEARD AT ALL SPEEDS AND MORE SO WITH MORE WEIGHT IN THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER SEVEN TIMES. THE TECHNICIAN REPLACED THE STRUTS AND THE SWAY BAR BUT THE FAILURE CONTINUED. THE TECHNICIAN STATED THE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY THE BALL JOINT ASSEMBLY WHICH WAS FAULTY. THE TECHNICIAN STATED THERE WERE NO REPAIRS AVAILABLE TO  REMEDY THE FAILURE AND STATED IT WAS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 59,000.
AT 20,000 MILES THE VEHICLE HAD A FAILED WHEEL BEARING (NOISE/VIBRATION), PASSENGER-SIDE FRONT.  DRIVER-SIDE FRONT WHEEL BEARING FAILED AT 34,000 MILES.  DEALER REPLACED THE HUB/BEARING ASSEMBLIES UNDER WARRANTY.  THIS IS A DEFECT, AS THE BEARINGS SHOULD NOT FAIL AT SUCH A LOW MILEAGE.  HOW LONG WILL THE REPLACEMENT BEARINGS LAST ?  *TR
WHEN I TOOK THE CAR FOR SERVICING TO THE OPEN ROAD HONDA (RT 1S) IN NJ, THEY TOLD ME THAT THE WEAR AND TEAR ON THE REAR BRAKE PAD IS HEAVY AND IT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. I DROVE THE CAR MOSTLY HIGHWAYS DURING MY PREVIOUS JOB FOR MOST OF THE MILES AND I DIDN'T EVEN APPLY MUCH BRAKES AND NOW THE DEALER IS SAYING THAT THE REAR BRAKE PAD IS GONE AND IT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. HOWEVER THE FRONT PAD IS AS GOOD AS NEW. HOW CAN IT BE. I CAME TO KNOW THAT THERE IS A CLASS ACTION SUIT WITH HONDA ON THIS SUBJECT, BUT IT SEEMS THEY'RE COVERING ONLY A CERTAIN FEW VIN NUMBER, THIS IS TOTAL ABSURDITY, IF THE BRAKING SYSTEM IS FAILING FOR ANY / ALL MODELS OF HONDA, IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED.  *TR
CAR HAD REAR 2MM  AND 7.5MM FRONT. SEND MY LETTER TO GET REFUND FROM HONDA. BUT HONDA CLAIM THE VIN ON MY CAR WAS NOT DEFECTIVE SO THEY DO NOT PAY FOR MY BRAKES. SEND A SECOND LETTER STILL WAITING FOR HONDA TO REPLY.  *KB
TL*THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 HONDA ACCORD. THE CONTACT STATED WHILE DRIVING IN REVERSE THE VEHICLE MADE A LOUD METAL NOISE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER WHO PERFORMED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST THAT INDICATED THAT THE REAR BRAKE WAS WORN.  THE DEALER STATED THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO WEAR AND TEAR.

I PURCHASED A NEW 2010 HONDA ACCORD LX-P IN LATE NOVEMBER OF 2009. ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2010, I SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT TO BRING THE VEHICLE IN BECAUSE THERE WAS A SEVERE WHINING NOISE AT IDLE THAT WAS MOST PROMINENT UNDER SPEEDS OF 20 MPH. THE WHINING NOISE STARTED ABOUT FOUR WEEKS EARLIER AND SEEMED TO DISSIPATE ONCE THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTED INTO SECOND GEAR. THE NOISE SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE A POWER STEERING PUMP LOW ON FLUID OR JUST BEFORE THE PUMP STARTS TO GO OUT.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE DIRECTLY TO THE DEALERSHIP SINCE IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY AND LEFT IT THERE FOR SEVERAL HOURS. UPON RETURNING TO THE GARAGE, THE TECHNICIAN INFORMED ME THE NOISE IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE WITH ALL ACCORDS WITH THE 4-CYLINDER ENGINE AND AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION. HE STATED HE EVEN REMOVED THE POWER STEERING BELT TO RULE-OUT THE POWER STEERING PUMP. I THEN ASKED HIM IF THIS WAS THE CASE, WHERE EXACTLY WAS THE WHINING COMING FROM? HE INFORMED ME THAT HE JUST DIDN'T KNOW.    PLEASE HELP! TO OVERCOME THE SEVERE WHINING, I HAVE TO TURN THE RADIO UP OR TURN ON THE AC/HEATER FAN TO DROWN OUT THE NOISE.

On [XXX], my daughter rear-ended a stopped vehicle while trying to merge. She was driving approximately 60-70mph at the time of impact. The front end of her car was completely smashed and the insurance company deemed it a total loss. Despite the force and speed at impact, her airbags did not deploy.  She hit her head on the steering wheel, causing a concussion. She continues to suffer from the effects of the concussion. She is under the car of a neurologist and chiropractor.   I contacted Honda to report this on 10.3.2023 and was told to "wait by the phone" because someone would be calling me back immediately as it was a high priority case. The case number is [XXX]. No one has called me. I called back on 10.6.2023 to notify them that the car insurance company was taking possession of the car and was told to take pictures. I have never received a call back for additional details. INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)

The vehicle was towed to a body shop and was awaiting inspection from the insurance company. The dealer and manufacturer were not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 78,000.

TL* TAKATA RECALL. THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HONDA ACCORD. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE RECALL NOTICE FOR NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 16V346000 (AIR BAGS) WAS RECEIVED IN MAY OF 2016. AFTER CONTACTING THE DEALER AND THE MANUFACTURER ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS, THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED THAT THE PARTS NEEDED FOR THE RECALL REMEDY WERE STILL NOT AVAILABLE AND NO ESTIMATED TIME FOR RECEIVING THE PARTS COULD BE PROVIDED. THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE. VIN TOOL CONFIRMS PARTS NOT AVAILABLE.
TAKATA RECALL - I OWN 2 HONDAS THAT ARE BOTH UNDER RECALL AT THE SAME TIME FOR THE SAME ISSUES.  I HAVE REQUESTED A RENTAL FROM HONDA DUE TO FEAR FOR MY LIFE AND THE LIFE OF MY PASSENGERS.  THEY TOLD ME TO NOT LET SOMEONE RIDE IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT.  WHICH MEANS I CAN ONLY TRANSPORT 4 PEOPLE INSTEAD OF 5 THAT THE CAR IS SUPPOSE TO SAFELY TRANSPORT.  I BOUGHT THIS AUTOMOBILE TO TRANSPORT 5 PEOPLE SAFELY.  HONDA IS TELLING ME I CAN'T TRANSPORT 5 PEOPLE SAFELY UNTIL THIS IS FIXED.  HONDA NEEDS TO PROVIDE ME WITH SAFE TRANSPORTATION FOR 5 PEOPLE UNTIL THEY CAN FIX THIS CAR TO TRANSPORT 5 PEOPLE SAFELY.  MY COMPLIANT IS HONDA IS NOT PROVIDING ME WITH MY CAR OR ANOTHER CAR TO TRANSPORT 5 PEOPLE SAFELY WHICH IS WHAT I PURCHASED FROM THEM.
I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE IN FEBRUARY 2015. THE FIRST THING THAT I HAD TO FIX WAS THE AXLE ( OUTPUT SHAFT ) SEAL LEAK WHICH THE HONDA DEALER DID NOT WANT TO REPAIR EVEN THOUGH THE CAR ONLY HAD 62,000. ALSO, IT MAKES A LOUD NOISE IN THE BACK WHEN I GO OVER THE SPEED BUMP WHICH IS COMING FROM THE SUSPENSION.  IN ADDITION, WHENEVER I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO NTB FOR AN OIL CHANGE. THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THE REAR MAIN SEAL NEEDS TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE IT IS STARTING TO LEAK MOTOR OIL. AND AGAIN, THE HONDA DEALER DOES NOT WANT TO HONOR THE POWERTRAIN WARRANTY ON MY VEHICLE DESPITE THE LOW MILEAGE IT HAS. SEEMS LIKE I NEED TO FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST THEM.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HONDA ACCORD. WHILE DRIVING 37 MPH, THE CONTACT'S VEHICLE WAS INVOLVED IN A HEAD ON COLLISION. THE AIR BAGS FAILED TO DEPLOY. THERE WERE NO INJURIES. A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 70,000.
THE FRONT SEATS IN THE 2011 HONDA ACCORD NEED TO BE RECALLED AND REPLACED. IT HAS CAUSED ME (AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS ONLINE) TO HAVE SEVERE BACK PAIN. THE LOWER LUMBAR SUPPORT STICKS OUT WAY TO FAR AND CAUSES UNEVEN SUPPORT TO YOUR LOWER AND UPPER BACK. I HAVE NEVER HAD BACK ISSUES, BUT AFTER DRIVING THIS CAR FOR A WEEK, I AM IN SERIOUS PAIN. SO WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS? GO BUY EXPENSIVE AFTERMARKET PILLOWS THAT DON'T WORK? TRADE THE CAR BACK IN AND LOSE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS? OR MAYBE I SHOULD JUST LIVE WITH THE PAIN AND ABSORB THE COST OF A CHIROPRACTOR? NORMALLY I WOULDN'T COMPLAIN, BUT THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE. JUST LOOK IT UP ONLINE. THIS SERIOUSLY NEEDS TO BE FIXED ASAP OR HONDA COULD GET SUED. THERE IS ENOUGH INFO OUT THERE AND UPSET CUSTOMERS TO CAUSE HONDA A HUGE LEGAL NIGHTMARE. *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HONDA ACCORD. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING, A CHILD WAS ABLE TO FASTEN THE SEAT BELT AROUND THEIR NECK, BUT THE CONTACT WAS UNABLE TO REMOVE THE SEAT BELT FROM THE CHILD'S NECK. THE CONTACT WAS FORCED TO CUT THE SEAT BELT WITH A BOX CUTTER. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT TAKEN TO THE DEALER, BUT THE MANUFACTURER WAS CONTACTED IN REGARDS TO THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 3,500 AND THE CURRENT MILEAGE WAS 3,568.
VEHICLE SUFFERS FROM AN UN-COMMANDED ACCELERATION/THROTTLE PROBLEM WHICH IS COMPLETELY REPRODUCIBLE.  IT AFFECTS THE LOW SPEED BEHAVIOR OF THE VEHICLE PARTICULARLY DURING TURNS WHERE THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR LOSS OF CONTROL.  THE DEFECT WAS CONFIRMED BY HONDA STAFF WHEN ROAD TESTING IT VERSUS OTHER SIMILAR NEW VEHICLES.  I HAVE DOCUMENTATION FROM HONDA TO CORROBORATE THAT.  IN ANY CASE, AT THIS POINT, HONDA IS EITHER UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO ADDRESS AND RESOLVE THIS SAFETY DEFECT.
car cut off
The Driver's side seat belt does not latch. The problem started 3 months ago.  We contacted Honda Dealer and was told it is not part of the Honda Seat Belt Recall as the recall relates to Honda models 2018-2020.  However please note it is the SAME EXACT PROBLEM with the seat belt in my car.  I have been using the PASSENGER SIDE LATCH to buckle the seatbelt. I contacted Honda Corporation and was told to have the car inspected by local Honda Dealer and provide them with a Inspection report. Honda corporation is not willing to fix the seatbelt issue. I am informing your agency so you can take appropriate action and include the older models of Honda with the same seat belt problem as the current recall on Honda before someone get injured due to the fact they are using passenger seat belt latch.  Also we are unable to use the passenger seat. Please give this matter urgent attention as it is a BIG SAFETY issue.
WHEN DRIVING ON HIGHWAY THE CAR STRUGGLES TO MAINTAIN A STRAIGHT LINE AND WHEN GOING OVER BUMPS OR UNEVEN SURFACE THE CAR STEERING WILL LOOSE CONTROL
DRIVER WINDOW WILL NOT GO UP. LOOKING ONLINE THERE'S AN ENTIRE THREAD OF HONDA OWNERS REGARDING THIS SAME ISSUE!! YOUR WINDOWS ARE MALFUNCTIONING AND I HAVE ONLY HAD THIS CAR FOR 18 MONTHS!! MOST MOTORS IN WINDOWS LAST!! NOT SURE WHY HONDA HASN'T HAD A RECALL ON THIS ISSUE!!
BACKING INTO DRIVEWAY THE CAR ACCELERATED TO FULL SPEED BY ITS SELF. PUSHED THE BRAKE PEDAL WITH BOTH FEET, AND THE CAR WOULD NOT SLOW. TRAVELLED ABOUT 60 FEET AND CRASHED INTO OUR DOUBLE GARAGE DOING SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE GARAGE AND THE CAR WAS A TOTAL LOSS. NOT SURE WHAT SPEED CAR ACCELERATED TO, BEST GUESS 30 MPH.
TAKATA INFLATORS: THERE ARE CURRENTLY FOUR RECALLS FOR HONDA ACCORD 2012 FOR PASSENGER INFLATORS BUT FOR MY VIN THERE ARE NONE. MY VEHICLE WHICH ONLY HAS 39K MILES FAILED INSPECTION FOR MY SRS LIGHT. REGARDLESS OF THE MILLIONS OF AIRBAG RECALLS HONDA HAS DONE THEY REFUSED TO SCAN MY CAR FOR THE SRS CODE UNLESS I PAID THEM FOR IT. I WENT TO AUTOZONE AND HAD THE SCAN DONE FOR FREE AND GOT SRS CODE 32-10 "OPEN OR INCREASED RESISTANCE IN THE RIGHT SIDE AIRBAG INFLATOR". I CANNOT DRIVE MY VEHICLE NOW BECAUSE OF THIS AND CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY THE 1400 PLUS DOLLARS TO HAVE THESE ITEMS THAT SHOULDN'T BE DEFECTIVE IN THE FIRST PLACE REPAIRED. NOW I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL MY VEHICLE IS ADDED TO THE RECALL LIST.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 HONDA ACCORD. WHILE DRIVING 30 MPH, THE POWER STEERING SEIZED, THE BRAKES LOCKED AND FAILED TO RESPOND, AND THE VEHICLE STALLED. ALSO, THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER INDICATORS ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO A LOCAL DEALER (NARDY HONDA SMITHTOWN, 559 MIDDLE COUNTY RD, ST JAMES, NY 11780), BUT THE VEHICLE WAS UNABLE TO BE DIAGNOSED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO A LOCAL DEALER (ATLANTIC HONDA, 1375 SUNRISE HIGHWAY, BAYSHORE, NY 11706) WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE  BATTERY AND ALTERNATOR NEEDED TO BE REPAIRED. THE FAILURE RECURRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 53,000.
TWO REAR DOORS WILL NOT UNLOCK WHEN USEING THE SWITCHES ON THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR. AND REAR DOORS WILL NOT UNLOCK WHEN USING THE REMOTE ON THE KEY RING. THE DOOR MOTORS SOUND LIKE THEY ARE DYING. ALL OF THIS HAPPENS WHEN THE CAR IS IN THE OFF MODE ENGINE NOT RUNNING AND IN PARK.

MY VEHICLE ONLY HAS 88,000 MILES AND THE POWER STEERING PUMP IS STARTING TO SCREAM. IS THERE A POSSIBLE RECALL ON THIS ITEM?
I WAS SLOWING DOWN AND BRAKING FOR A RED TRAFFIC LIGHT.  I HAD TO APPLY A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THE BRAKES AS IT FELT LIKE THE CAR WAS GOING TO ACCELERATE.  THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THAT I HAD THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM.  BOTH TIMES, THIS ACCELERATION ATTEMPT WHEN I WAS BRAKING, DID NOT HAPPEN FOR THE REMAINDER OF MY DRIVE.  I DID NOT NOTICE THE ENGINE REVVING OR SEE THAT THE ENGINE WAS OVERHEATED.  I WAS DRIVING ON CITY STREET WHERE THE POSTED PEED LIMIT IS 25 MPH AND I WAS DRIVING WITHING THE SPEED LIMIT.
CAR ACCELERATES THEN SUDDENLY STOPS ACCELERATION EVEN THOUGH GAS PEDAL IS INCREASING. SUDDENLY THE CAR ACCELERATES AT PEDAL POSITION CAUSING A SUDDEN JURK MOTION FORWARD DUE TO SUDDEN OVER COMPENSATED ACCELERATION.  OCCURS SPORADICALLY. CAUTION MUST BE TAKEN WHEN BEHIND OTHER CARS OR CROSSING INTO MEDIAN ON 4 LANE HIGHWAYS. PAUSE MAY LAST AS LONG AS 4 SECONDS WHICH IS A LONG TIME WITH ON-COMING TRAFFIC WHILE CROSSING ROAD. ALSO COULD RESULT IN REAR IN COLLISION FROM CARS IN REAR DUE TO SUDDEN PAUSE IN ACCELERATION AND REAR CAR ACCELERATING SMOOTHLY AT NORMAL PACE. REAR CAR WOULD NOT EXPECT YOU TO SUDDENLY STOP ACCELERATIONSUCH AS AT RED LIGHT.SUSPECT IT IS ACCELERATOR POSITION SENSOR CAUSING THE PROBLEM BUT HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED AT THIS TIME SINCE I CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE CAR PAYMENT AND REPAIR AT SAME TIME. WILL HAVE LOOKED INTO WHEN MONEY IS AVALLABLE FOR DIAGNOSTIC AND REPAIR OF PROBLEM. THERE IS NO DOUBT THIS IS NOT NORMAL SINCE I ALSO OWN A 2010 MODEL HONDA ACCORD AND NEVER HAD SUCH PROBLEM. THIS IS A 2012 MODEL AND SUPRISED SINCE HONDA MAKES GOOD AUTOMOBILES. PURCHASED USED IN JANUARY OF 2015 FROM TOWSEND BMW IN TUSCALOOSA, AL. ELECTRICAL COVERAGE EXPIRED NOV. OF 2014. WILL HAVE TO PAY OUT-OF-POCKET FOR REPAIR. BMW DEALERSHIP WOULD NOT COVER PROBLEM AFTER SALE. WILL HAVE TO TAKE TO DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR OR SOME OTHER REPUTABLE AUTO REPAIR SHOP.CAR FAX SHOWED NO ACCIDENT REPORTS.    *JS
I BEGAN TO HEAR AN INTERMITTENT SCRAPING, RUBBING NOISE IN THE BACK OF THE CAR. I TOOK IT IN TO THE DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT THE CAR AND THEY TOLD ME I NEEDED REAR BRAKE PADS ONLY AND THE FRONT BRAKES WERE FINE, NO PROBLEM'. SOON AFTER, I HAD NECESSITY TO BRAKE SUDDENLY ON THE FREEWAY AND I DISCOVERED THAT THE FRONT END SHOOK VIOLENTLY WHEN BRAKING AT 55-60 MPH! I FELT A DREAD TO TELL THE DEALER DUE TO PREVIOUS ISSUES WITH THEM. I FINALLY TOOK IT BACK AND WAS TOLD THAT NOW THE FRONT BRAKES WERE WARPED AND NEEDED THE 'ROTORS TURNED! AT A COST OF $300.00+ TO ME. I COMPLAINED THAT THIS CAR IS STILL UNDER EXTENDED WARRANTY AND DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH MILEAGE FOR SUCH DRASTIC MEASURES OF TURNING THE ROTORS. I RECEIVED A VAGUE ESTIMATE  WHICH OFFERED TO REPAIR AT NO CHARGE TO CUSTOMER.  WHY CAN'T HONDA REPLACE THESE ROTORS AND NOT JUST TURN THEM? I AM STILL PAYING FOR THIS CAR AND CERTAINLY NEVER ANTICIPATED SUCH A MESS AS THIS WHEN IT IS STILL NEW! IS THERE SOME PROBLEM WITH THESE ROTORS AS YET UNDISCLOSED BY HONDA? I DID MONTHS OF RESEARCH AND TEST DRIVING AND LOOKING FOR MY FIRST BRAND NEW CAR. I EXPECT MORE FROM HONDA AND THIS IS VERY DISAPPOINTING! HONESTLY, I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE THIS CAR FOR MANY YEARS TO COME AND NOW I FIND MYSELF WONDERING WHY I BOUGHT A NEW CAR IN THE FIRST PLACE. THIS IS NOT A GOOD START!    PLEASE PROVIDE SOME ANSWERS FOR ME.    [XXX]    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR

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
THE FRONT SEAT DESIGN ON THE HONDA ACCORD IS TERRIBLE.  IT CAUSES LOWER BACK PAIN AND PUSHES YOUR HEAD FORWARD.  DUE TO THE UNCOMFORTABLE SEAT DESIGN YOUR FOCUS MOVES FROM BEING ON THE ROAD TO TRYING TO ALLEVIATE PAIN OR GET COMFORTABLE AND IN TURN REDUCES FOCUS ON THE ROAD AND INCREASES RISK OF HAVING AN ACCIDENT.

WHILE DRIVING 65 MPH THE REAR PASSENGER TIRE BLEW UP.  IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE NEVER FELT BEFORE. I FELT SAFE DRIVING THIS CAR UNTIL NOW.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE FOR INSPECTION AT THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY WERE NO HELP.  WHEN I TOLD THEM ABOUT THE TIRE, IT SEEM THAT THEY ALREADY KNEW HOW IT HAPPENED.  IMMEDIATELY THE MANAGER CAME TO CHECK UNDER THE TIRE AND WITHIN 30 SECONDS OF INSPECTION SAID THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO REPLACE THE TIRE BECAUSE IT WAS CAUSED BY A PUNCTURE.  THE MANAGER SAID THERE IS A BREAK CABLE RIGHT ABOVE THE TIRE AND THAT IS WHAT CAUSED THE TIRE TO RUPTURE.  THEN OFFERED TO CHECK THE VEHICLE JUST IN CASE BUT KNEW HE KNEW THEY WERE NOT COVERING THE TIRE.  HE OFFERED ME TO ONLY PAY FOR THE TIRE BUT WILL NOT CHARGE FOR INSTALLATION.  NEED HELP!!!  *TR

After a driveshaft recall repair was performed on July 10, 2025, at Germain Honda of Dublin, my 2013 Honda Accord EX-L immediately began showing multiple safety system warning lights, including ABS, VSA, traction control, and check engine. These lights had never appeared prior to the repair.  Diagnostic codes included: •VSA Solenoid Valve Malfunction •Modulator Control Unit Power Source Circuit (IG) Low Voltage  These point directly to the ABS/VSA modulator, which is located near where the driveshaft repair was done. Despite the timing, Honda has refused to cover the repair, quoting me nearly $3,000. The dealer also cleared the codes before I arrived and then claimed they were “historic” with no documentation.  I’ve confirmed my battery and alternator are in good condition, ruling out the common causes of voltage errors. I believe something was disturbed or left improperly connected during the recall service, resulting in a dangerous condition involving the vehicle’s braking and stability systems.  This is a potential safety risk that arose after a manufacturer-issued recall repair, and I am requesting a formal investigation into similar cases if reported.
While driving, the steering wheel jerks to the left. There is a constant pressure of the wheel turning left. This puts me and others in danger. There have been other experiences from other people on different forums that have experienced this. Warning lamp did come on for electric steering but turned off a few days later.
While driving my 2013 Honda Accord sedan on the turnpike, I experienced a critical failure of the Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) modulator, which was later inspected and confirmed to be malfunctioning by a Honda service technician at South Motors Honda. This component is available for inspection upon request. As I was traveling at approximately 65 mph, the ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) malfunctioned, causing the brakes to lock up when I attempted to slow down for traffic ahead. This sudden loss of braking control put my safety and the safety of others at significant risk, as I nearly collided with the vehicle in front of me.  The problem has been reproduced and confirmed by an independent service center. The vehicle has not been inspected by the manufacturer, police, or insurance representatives. Prior to the failure, several warning lamps, including the VSA, ABS, and BRAKE lights, illuminated on the dashboard. These warning lights first appeared about a week before the incident, but I was unable to get the vehicle serviced immediately due to scheduling constraints.  Additionally, the Front Collision Warning system was not functioning, which further compromised my ability to avoid a potential accident. This malfunction was particularly concerning as it failed to alert me to the rapidly approaching vehicle ahead, exacerbating the dangerous situation caused by the ABS failure.
I was stopped at a stop light. The light turned green and I started to go. My car had a major issue and was stuck in traffic. I had to push the vehicle out of traffic with the assistance of the Police Department. My vehicle was not operable. After an investigation into the issue, the Driver front axle broke in in half. No lights or prior indicators existed before the incident. Repairs have been made and this issue has caused damage to the other axle. Both have been replaced by authorized repair shops. I continue to have a “wobbling” issue while accelerating. I did go to a Honda dealership for the balance issue. They did say it is common for the axle to break and there was a recall for my Make/ Model and Year that I did not qualify for. Paperwork is attached.   I have children and if my children were in my vehicle with me and I was on the highway this incident could have led to serious physical injury or death. There is a current recall which my vehicle doesn’t apply for. I believe my vehicle should apply. A news article from Honda shown to me by a Honda Dealership rep is attached as well as invoices.
The steering wheel of Honda Accord ex 2013 suddenly malfunctioned. It becomes heavy and stiff. It can not come back to the center automatically after left turn. We brought the car to our local Honda dealer. They diagnosed the car and told us the car "NEEDS EPS GEAR BOX ONLY ". They said "NOT RELATED TO THE WARRANTY EXTENSION $3905 PLUS TAX AND SHOP SUPPLIES". There is not warning when the engine of the car is turned on. My car had less than 68K miles when this happened on 07/13/2024.
Several Dashboard lights came on. Electric Steering ,Tire Pressure Sensor, Traction Control, ABS, Brake lights. Paid 300 dollar diagnostic fee for Honda dealer to tell me this is a known issue on Hondas and would cost 3,000 dollars to repair. Final verdict, ABS module needs replacement. Also seems to be causing issues with the transmission shift points due to the Vehicle speed sensor having an error with code P-0717 input shaft speed error. Upon doing research, the mother board connections from connector to the motherboard are very thin and lose connection over time causing safety issues since it's unknown if the ABS is working correctly with the fault lights on, also the tire pressure is not currently monitored correctly due to the light is always on among other monitored systems that have lights illuminated on the dashboard.
Steering completely locked up. No errors or warnings appeared on the dashboard so the car was towed in for repairs. The dealership updated EPS software to fix the issue.
The steering wheel stopped turning smoothly and would occasional turn toward the right erratically.  The car is available for inspection upon request.  Since now the steering wheel will occasional move on it's own or become more difficult to turn, the car is now more difficult to drive and thereby more of a safety risk.  The steering problem was confirmed by a local mechanic.  The vehicle has not been inspected by the manufacturer, police, or insurance representative regarding this issue.  There has been no warning lamps or messages on the dashboard in regards to this steering issue.
The contact owns a 2013 Honda Accord. The contact stated while driving 25 MPH, the vehicle started jerking upon depressing the accelerator pedal. The check engine, the Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA), the electric power steering, TPMS, Forward Collision Avoidance, and the Lane Departure warning lights illuminated. The vehicle was not diagnosed nor repaired. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 162,000.
The vehicle began pulling hard to the left without any incident to cause this.  Tires were replaced but the mechanic could not get the vehicle properly aligned.  Replaced struts and the wheels still would not align.  The dealer was unable to find a cause for this.  There are no codes or warnings.

Power steering failure, complete power steering rack replacement by Honda Dealership. Symptoms identical to Honda Warranty Extension 5Z2, Service Bulletin #15-056. Dealer confirmed no damage to power steering rack. Vehicle did not throw DCT 53-01 or 53-012 so Honda and Dealer refused to repair under warranty extension, forcing customer to pay out of pocket. This is the subject of an ongoing NHTSA investigation which began May 2021.  The consumer stated that the issue occurred all the time and varying in seriousness. Once repaired, the issue did not occur.
Recieved a “FCW SYSTEM FAILED” on dash along with check engine light, power steering, LDW, FCW lights, brake system lights. Car wouldn’t turn off and trunk wouldn’t open. It has been seen by an independent service center.

At about 40k miles since I purchased my 2013 Accord Sport 6 speed MT new, there has been premature starter failure causing me to replace the starter. In addition, the 2.4 L Earth Dreams engine consumes a quart of oil every approximately 1000 miles. I have had honda's in the past and never had to do this on a fairly new car. I also changed my PCV valve thinking it may be faulty. After doing so, I have the same issue. I even complained to Honda several times and expressed my frustration. At about 50% oil life remaining, and if the engine oil is not topped off, the dip stick to check the engine oil will be bone dry. I hope NHTSA will look into the Earth Dreams engine. This mechanic did an excellent Youtube video explaining the issue. https://youtu.be/tZ24wh6eCpE. It is time to force a Honda recall on all Earth Dreams engine before premature engine failure starts happening and Honda blaming customers for not properly maintaining the engine when it is a faulty engine to begin with.
Steering has a mind of its own.  Wanders lanes and driver has no control for several seconds.  Have drifted into other lanes while trying to control / steer but no response. This lasts for just a brief time but it's extremely unnerving. Recently the car turned hard right with no notice. Luckily had both hands on the wheel and steering worked enough to pull left before I ran off road.  Frankly, I am afraid to drive it.  Took the car to local dealer yesterday. They ran diagnostics and test drove but found no issues with steering. I advised that I could not retrieve the vehicle late yesterday but would do so this morning.  Several hours after that conversation, having heard that they found nothing wrong, the same rep called me and said "you can't drive this car".  He relayed that technician was moving the car from the bay to the lot when the car took a hard right and nearly collided with another car parked in their lot. The tech brought the car back to the shop and up on the rack where they observed the car again make a hard right turn. No one was behind the wheel when this occurred.  I just rcvd an estimate for repair ~ $3,700.00.  Electronic power steering rack assembly accounts for $3,140.00 of this cost. Alignment & some other diagnostic costs take it up from there.
ON TUESDAY, MAY 3, 2021, MY CAR SUDDENLY VERED TO THE LEFT AND I HAD TURN MY STEERING WHEEL EXCESSIVLEY (ABOUT 90 DEGREES) TO GET MY CAR BACK INTO MY LANE. IF THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CAR NEXT TO I WOULD HAVE HIT IT SOMEONE OR SOMETHING. I SUDDENLY WAS HEARING A CRACKLING NOISE FROM MY STEERING COLUMN. I DROVE MY CAR A COUPLE OF MORE TIMES BEFORE I TOOK IT TO ROUSH HONDA IN WESTERVILLE ON 5/12/2021. WHEN I TOOK MY CARI EXPLAINED THE PREVIOUS SITUATION AND TOLD THE GENTLEMAN THAT THE NOISE IN THE STEERING COLUMN WAS GETTING LOUDER AND LOUDER AND HE SAID I WAS GETTING CHARGED $99 TO FIND OUT WHAT THE NOISE IS ABOUT AND WHAT WAS GOING ON.  ON 5/13/2021, THE SERVICE DEPART. CALLED TO LET ME KNOW THAT IT WAS AN ALIGNMENT ISSUE AND SAID NOTHING ABOUT THE NOISE.  I ASKED THEM WHAT ABOUT THE NOISE AND SHE SAID THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE SERVICE WRITE UP ABOUT A NOISE.  SO I ASKED FOR A MANAGER.  WHEN THE MANAGER CALLED, MAX WAGNER, HE TRIED TO TELL ME THAT THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM THE TIRE AND AXLE AND NOT THE STEERING COLUMN.  YOU CAN CLEARELY HEAR THE NOISE COMING FROM THE INSIDE OF THE CAR AND STEERING COLUMN.  I HAVE A LIFETIME ALIGNMENT WITH FIRESTONE AND TAKE MY CAR ON A REGULAR AND RESPONSIBLE BASIS.  HONDA IS CLEARLY GIVING ME A RUN AROUND AND IS AVOIDING TO FIX THE ISSUE THAT IS CLEARLY A PART MANUFACTURING DEFECT. CAN THIS BE INVESTIGATED BY YOUR AGENCY?

IN CERTAIN VEHICLES, THE PLASTIC CASEOF THE BATTERY SENSOR MAY HAVE GAPS THAT ALLOW MOISTURE TO ENTER THE SENSOR. IF MOISTURE CONTAINING CONDUCTIVE SUBSTANCES (SUCH AS ROAD SALT) ENTERS THE BATTERY SENSOR, IT COULD CAUSE AN ELECTRICAL SHORT AND SUBSEQUENTLY, A FIRE. RECALL DATE: JUNE 29, 2017. SO FAR NO ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN. NOW FALL SEASON IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. I AM CONCERNING ABOUT SAFETY OF MY VEHICLE ABOUT ELECTRICAL SHORT CIRCUIT RESULT IN FIRE. I CHECKED WITH HONDA DEALER LAST WEEK. HE SAID PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO REPLACE IT.
VEHICLE IS 2013 AND I HAVE REPLACED THE STARTED AND BATTERY 4 TIMES DUE TO ENGINE FAILURE, IT TURN ON AND IMMEDIATLY DIES OFF, MY CAR HAS BEEN TOWED 6 TIMES OR MORE SINCE I BOUGHT, I HAVE DONE ALL THE MAINTENANCE ALL THE TIME AND COMPUTER NEVER IDENTIFIES THIS PROBLEM. I AM SO TIRED OF THIS TRASH CAR, I STILLOWE ON IT OR ELSE I WOULD JUST PARK IT ON THE FRONT LOT OF A DEALER AND PUT A BIG SIGN SAYING DO NOT BUY HONDA ACCORDS, MANY PROBLEMS ALWAYS. LASTLY, I ASKED THE DRIVER FOR THE TOW TRUCK WHICH KIND OF CARS HE TOWS THE MOST DUE TO ENGINE FAILURE AND HE SAID, LAUGHING "HONDAS"...FIRST TIME IT FAIL TO START WAS AT 54K MILES.

THE TPMS LIGHT CAME ON A FEW HUNDRED MILES BEFORE A TIRE BLEW OUT.  I CONSIDERED THE TEAR IN THE SIDE-WALL OF THE TIRE BEFORE THE BLOW TO BE THE LIKELY CAUSE OF THE TPMS LIGHT ON (LOSING PRESSURE).  AFTER A BRAND NEW SET OF FOUR (4) TIRES, NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I TRY TO RE-CALIBRATE THE TPMS, OR CHECK THE TIRE PRESSURE MYSELF, OR TAKE THE CAR TO THE TIRE SHOP TO CHECK THE PRESSURES, THE LIGHT REMAINS ON NO MATTER WHAT.  THIS IS AN ON0GOING ISSUE THAT CONTINUES DAILY, DESPITE DRIVING CONDITIONS.
AFTER ONLY 40,000 MILES, 2013 V6 ACCORD, CAR STARTER GIVING PROBLEM. CAR DIDN'T START AT ONE POINT AND AFTER MANY TRIALS, STARTED WITH JUMP START AFTER THAT, STARTED GIVING JERK LIKE ENGINE STALLS DURING DRIVING. SCARY AND DANGEROUS SITUATION.
I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF A 2013 HONDA ACCORD, EX-L,.  MY HONDA HAS 42K MILES.  AT ABOUT 25K MILES MY ACCORD STARTED TO MAKE A VERY OBVIOUS AND DISTURBING DRONING/HUMMING NOISE AT SPEEDS ABOVE 40 MPH.  THE NOISE BECAME PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER AS TIME WENT BY.  I BROUGHT THE CAR TO MY LOCAL HONDA DEALER 2 TIMES AND ASKED THEM TO FIX THE PROBLEM, TO NO AVAIL.    AFTER HAVING NEW TIRES INSTALLED AT 42K MILES, AND THE DRONING NOISE WAS STILL OCCURRING, I BROUGHT THE CAR TO MY LOCAL HONDA DEALER A THIRD TIME AND THEY DIAGNOSED THE NOISE PROBLEM AS COMING FROM A DEFECTIVE FRONT RIGHT WHEEL BEARING AND A DEFECTIVE REAR LEFT WHEEL BEARING.  BOTH WHEEL BEARINGS WERE REPLACED ON JULY 27, 2016 AND THE DRONING NOISE ABOVE 40 MPH IS GONE.  REPLACING THE WHEEL BEARINGS FIXED THE PROBLEM!   THE SERVICE ADVISOR AT THE DEALER WAS NOT ABLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE WHEEL BEARINGS FAILED, AND HE STATED THAT THE TECHNICIANS AT THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT KNOW WHY/HOW THE BEARINGS FAILED EITHER.    I CONTACTED HONDA AMERICA HQ ON AUGUST 1, 800-999-1009, AND WAS TOLD THAT HONDA AMERICA WOULD NOT DISCLOSE THE DETAILS OF THE BEARING FAILURES.  THEY ALSO DECLINED MY REQUEST TO AUTHORIZE THE REPLACEMENT OF THE REMAINING 2 WHEEL BEARINGS.  HONDA AMERICA ESTABLISHED A CASE NUMBER FOR MY ISSUE, CASE # 04884545.  DUE TO THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY FROM HONDA AMERICA AS TO THE CAUSE/RESOLUTION OF THE WHEEL BEARING FAILURES, I AM CONCERNED THAT THE UNDERLYING BEARING OR WHEEL STRUCTURE PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED, AND THAT MY 2013 HONDA ACCORD WILL BE SUBJECTED TO FUTURE WHEEL BEARING FAILURES.

WHEN THE TECHNICIAN STARTED THE CAR THE WARNING LIGHT WAS OFF AND THE POWER STEERING WAS WORKING. THEY STILL TOOK THE CARE BACK TO CHECK IT OUT, BUT SAID THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING. THEY SAID THAT IF IT HAPPENED AGAIN I MAY NEED TO REPLACE THE  TORQUE SENSOR(DTC 53-01), WHICH WOULD COST $674.88.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 HONDA ACCORD. WHILE AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT, ANOTHER VEHICLE CRASHED INTO THE CONTACT'S VEHICLE AND THE AIR BAGS FAILED TO DEPLOY. THE CONTACT SUSTAINED HEAD AND BACK INJURIES THAT REQUIRED MEDICAL ATTENTION. A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC; HOWEVER, THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 24,000. ......UPDATED 12/17/15 *BF    UPDATED 10/19/2017*CN
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 HONDA ACCORD. WHILE DRIVING AT 40 MPH, THE STEERING WHEEL SEIZED AND EXCESSIVE FORCE ON THE STEERING WHEEL WAS REQUIRED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 41,000.    UPDATED 5/4/15*CN
I TURNED MY VEHICLE ON AND HAD NO POWER STEERING. THE POWER STEERING LIGHT WAS ON, INDICATING THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM. I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE IT TO THE DEALER WHERE THEY TOLD ME THE POWER STEERING TORQUE HAD GONE BAD. TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE, I WOULD NEED TO HAVE THE POWER STEERING RACK REPLACED - OVER $2K! ALTHOUGH MY VEHICLE IS LESS THAN 2 YEARS OLD, I HAVE PASSED THE 35K MILE WARRANTY. THIS IS A PRETTY PAINFUL BILL TO BE FORCED TO PAY WITH SUCH A NEW CAR!! WHY IS THIS NOT RECALLED IF SO MANY ARE HAVING ISSUES WITH THIS?!!   *TR
MY DAUGHTERS 2013 HONDA ACCORD HAS BEEN PARKED FOR APPROXIMATELY 2 WEEKS WITHOUT BEING DRIVEN. ABOUT 2 DAYS AGO I NOTICED ALL THE WINDOWS WERE DOWN AND SUNROOF OPEN, AND LAST WEEK MY HUSBAND NOTICED THE TRUNK WAS OPEN.  YESTERDAY AND LAST NIGHT THE ALARM KEPT GOING OF AND LIGHTS FLASHING ,F AT FIRST WE THOUGHT IT WAS THE WIND.  BUT IT CONTIUNUED THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.   AT ONE POINT THE HEADLIGHTS WOULD NOT TURN OFF.  MY HUSBAND THOUGHT IT WAS THE BATTERY SO HE TRIED TO CHARGE THE BATTERY BUT IT WOULD NOT CHARGE AND AT ONE POINT ALL OF THE INTERIOR ELECTRICAL LIGHTS EVEN ON THE DRIVERS CONSOLE BEGAN BLINKING CONSTANTLY.    *TR
IT'S BEEN OVER 2 MOTHS AND 5 VISIT TO DEALER STILL GOT SAME PROBLEM CAR IS HONDA ACCORD 2013 AND IT'S SMART START CAR WON'T START SOMETIMES IT TAKES 20 MIN 40-50 TRY TO START THE CAR LOST OF SAME YEAR HONDA OWNERS ARE HAVING SAME EXACT PROBLEM YOU CAN SEE IT IN GOOGLE SEARCH OR YOUTUBE DEALER ALWAYS TOLD US THE CAR GOT NO PROBLEM BUT WERE HAVING SAME PROBLEM 2-3 TIMES A DAY WE GET STUCK EVERY WHERE WE GO SINCE CAR DOES NOT START.  *TR
FALSE LOW TIRE PRESSURE INDICATION.  HONDA ACCORD OWNED FOR 12 MONTHS, LESS THAN 12,000 MILES, I HAVE RECEIVED A LOW TIRE PRESSURE INDICATION FOR THE FOURTH TIME.  THE PREVIOUS THREE TIMES, BEFORE TAKING MY ACCORD TO THE DEALERSHIP, I CHECKED THE TIRE PRESSURE.  ALL FOUR TIRE PRESSURES ARE WITHIN RECOMMENDED SETTINGS.  AFTER RECEIVING MY VEHICLE AFTER SERVICE, THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT REPORTS ALL FOUR TIRE PRESSURES ARE LOW.  THE LAST TIME THE SERVICE MANAGER INDICATES THE TIRES NEED TO BE RE-INFLATED EVERY 2 - 3 THOUSAND MILES.  CONTINUED FALSE INDICATIONS IS AS MUCH AS A SAFETY ISSUE AS THE INDICATOR NOT WORKING AT ALL.  *TR
FRONT DRIVERS SEAT CAUSES NECK AND BACK ISSUES. NO ADJUSTMENT SEEMS TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM. TRY ADDING SEAT AND BACK CUSHION WITH NO RELIEF. THERE SEEMS TO BE NO RESOLUTION OFFERED BY HONDA. I BELIEVE THIS IS A DESIGN ISSUE AND COULD CAUSE A SAFETY ISSUE.  *TR
VEHICLE DOES NOT START EASILY. 3-5 IGNITION ATTEMPTS ARE NEEDED TO START IT EVERY TIME. HOWEVER, ONCE IT STARTS EVERYTHING SEEMS FINE. THE BATTERY WAS CHECKED BY THE DEALER AND FOUND TO BE FINE. THE PROBLEM IS NOT COLD RELATED AS IT OCCURS EVEN AT 40 F.   *TR
ONGOING ISSUE.  SOMETIMES WHEN I START MY CAR IN THE MORNING, OR WHEN LEAVING THE OFFICE IN THE EVENING, AND PUT IT IN REVERSE AND GIVE IT GAS THE ENGINE REVS, RPMS GO UP, BUT THE CAR WON'T GO.  I WILL ROLL DOWN MY DRIVEWAY (IT'S ON AN INCLINE), PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE AND STILL HAVE THE ISSUE.  THEN, WITHOUT WARNING, THE CAR WILL RESPOND TO ME GIVING IT GAS AND TAKE OFF.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS ISSUE!  I HAVE ALMOST COLLIDED WITH MY NEIGHBOR BEFORE BECAUSE OF THIS.  TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I WAS TOLD THAT THEY CAN'T DUPLICATE THE ISSUE SO THEY CAN'T CHECK IT.  IF THE CAR WON'T GO, HOW CAN I TAKE IT TO THEM WHILE I AM EXPERIENCING THE ISSUE?  *TR
WHEN THE CAR FIRST STARTS UP, AND YOU SHIFT IT INTO DRIVE, THE CAR LURCHES FORWARD RATHER RAPIDLY. IT IS ESPECIALLY BAD WHEN YOU GO FROM REVERSE TO DRIVE
I WAS DRIVING MY BRAND NEW 2013 HONDA ACCORD IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AS IT STARTED TO GET DARK.  THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME MY WIFE AND I HAD DRIVEN THE CAR AT NIGHT.  I WAS STARTLED TO REALIZE THAT IT SEEMED THAT SOMEONE HAD PUT A BLINDFOLD OVER THE TOP PORTION OF OUR EYES.  WE COULD NOT SEE ABOVE A CLEARLY DEFINED LINE.  BELOW THE LINE; LIGHT,  ABOVE THE LINE; TOTAL DARKNESS.  I HAD TO TURN ON THE HIGH BEAM LIGHTS TO ILLUMINATE THE ROAD ADEQUATELY AHEAD, EVEN AT LOW SPEED.  HAVING TO TURN OFF THE HIGH BEAMS WHEN ENCOUNTERING ON-COMING CARS WAS EXTREMELY UNNERVING.  THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS DO NOT ILLUMINATE ENOUGH TO READ NORMAL STREET AND INFORMATION SIGNS NOR TO SEE AN OBJECT, PERSON, OR ANYTHING THAT MIGHT CROSS YOUR PATH. IF YOU TURN THESE LIGHTS ON IN A DARK GARAGE YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THIS DEFINED LINE.  WE CALLED THE DEALER WHERE WE PURCHASED OUR CAR AND BROUGHT THE CAR IN AFTER EXPLAINING THE PROBLEM. THE SERVICE INTAKE MANAGER PAGED ME AND TOLD ME THEY FOUND NO PROBLEM, THAT THE LIGHTS WERE NORMAL FOR THIS CAR.  THIS SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE TO US.  I ASKED TO SPEAK WITH A MANAGER AND THE SERVICE DIRECTOR CAME OUT TO SPEAK WITH US.  HE TOLD US HE HAD ENCOUNTERED  7 OR 8 OTHER SUCH COMPLAINTS BUT ALL WERE DEEMED TO BE NORMAL FOR THE 2013 ACCORD!  HE FINALLY AGREED TO PERSONALLY CHECK-OUT THE PROBLEM.  HE GAVE US A LOANER 2013 ACCORD TO DRIVE HOME.  THE LOANER ACCORD HAD THE EXACT SAME HEADLIGHT FUNCTIONALITY!  THE NEXT DAY I CALLED THE DEALER AND WAS PUT ON THE PHONE WITH THE SERVICE INTAKE MANAGER WHO TOLD ME THAT A TECHNICIAN CHECKED THE LIGHTS AND THAT THEY WERE NORMAL AND COULD NOT BE ADJUSTED.  I CALLED HONDA AMERICA AND WAS TOLD THAT IF THE DEALER SAID THE LIGHTS WERE NORMAL THEN THERE WAS NOTHING HONDA COULD OR WOULD DO. AFTER REITERATING THAT THE CAR WAS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE AT NIGHT, SHE SUGGESTED THAT I MIGHT CONSIDER TAKING IT TO A DIFFERENT DEALER. I WILL TRY.  *TR
THIS STARTED OFF AS AN INTERMITTENT ISSUE BUT PROGRESSIVELY GOT WORSE (TWICE A DAY) UNTIL HONDA FLASHED AN UPDATE [A2A690] TO MY CAR.  NOW IT'S INTERMITTENT AGAIN (ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK).    THE PROBLEM ALWAYS HAPPENS FROM A COLD START.      THE ISSUE IS AFTER CRANKING MY CAR, WHEN I PUT THE CAR IN GEAR (REVERSE OR DRIVE) THE TRANSMISSION DOESN'T ENGAGE.  I CAN PRESS THE GAS PEDAL AND THE RPM'S WILL SHOOT UP BUT THE MPH DOESN'T MOVE, IT'S LIKE THE TRANSMISSION IS SLIPPING, IF I DON'T LET OFF THE GAS THE TRANSMISSION WILL ABRUPTLY ENGAGE AND CAN BE A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED I WAS IN THE PARKING GARAGE AT WORK AND THIS ISSUE ALMOST CAUSED ME TO CRASH INTO A PARKED VEHICLE.      NOW I HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T DO THIS EVERY TIME I PUT MY CAR IN GEAR.    I'VE BEEN TO TWO DIFFERENT HONDA DEALERS FOR A TOTAL OF 4 TIMES AND THEY SAY THEY CAN'T EVER REPRODUCE THE ISSUE.    HERE'S A LINK TO A VIDEO OF THE ISSUE WHEN I CAUGHT IT ON VIDEO.  HTTP://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=MJ1QDYJXGTE&FEATURE=EM-UPLOAD_OWNER#ACTION=SHARE.  *TR
FRONT BRAKE SQUEAL WHEN DRIVING, STEERING OR APPLYING BRAKES. SOUNDS LIKE THE WEAR SENSORS BUT IN FACT I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER (BAY RIDGE HONDA) IN BROOKLYN N.Y. THAT IT IS THE CLIPS THAT HOLD THE PADS IN PLACE. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT HONDA IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND THEY ARE WAITING FOR THE REPAIR PARTS TO ARRIVE ALONG WITH THE SERVICE BULLETIN.  *TR
I PURCHASED A 2013 HONDA ACCORD AFTER MY FORMER CAR WAS REAR ENDED AND I SUFFERED SEVERE WHIPLASH AND BACK PAIN.  AS A RESULT OF THIS I DID NOT REALIZE THE POOR DESIGN OF THE SEAT, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY THE HEAD RESTS. IN MY TEST DRIVE LASTING 10 - 15 MINUTES I DID NOT NOTICE IT, BUT AFTER TWO WEEKS OF OWNERSHIP AND DRIVING THE CAR 1 HOUR EACH WAY TO AND FROM WORK, I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE HEAD REST STICKS OUT SO FAR THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET COMFORTABLE IN THE CAR, AND ADDITIONALLY, IT HURT THE THORACIC PORTION OF MY MIDDLE BACK. I KNOW THIS, BECAUSE ALTHOUGH I AM STILL IN PHYSICAL THERAPY, ON THE WEEKEND WHEN I DON'T DRIVE THE CAR MY BACK HURTS MUCH LESS THAN IT DOES DURING THE WEEK WHEN I MAKE MY COMMUTE TO WORK. ADDITIONALLY THIS WEEKEND MY WIFE WAS A PASSENGER IN THE CAR FOR A LONG DRIVE AND SHE SUFFERED FROM THE SAME PAIN THAT I SUFFERED FROM. IT IS SO BAD, WE HAD TO CUT OUR TRIP SHORT. I CONTACTED THE DEALER SHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR AND THEY STATED THAT THIS IS NOT A DEFECT BUT A REQUIREMENT BY THE US GOVERNMENT.  THEREFORE I AM CONTACTING YOU CONCERNING HELP IN RESOLVING THIS ISSUE.  *TR
All my lights on my dash has come on, they said it’s the abs solenoid malfunction and I’m scared to drive the car, it’s my only car and Honda is charging almost 3500 to fix I don’t have that kind of money plus that is a computer problem so Honda should take care of that, anything could happen when I’m driving on the highway.. This should be a recall I see a lot of other people dealing with the same issue..
The contact owns a 2014 Honda Accord. The contact stated that while driving at an undisclosed speed, the vehicle vibrated abnormally, with an abnormal sound coming from the engine compartment. No warning lights were illuminated. The vehicle was taken to the dealer, who was unable to duplicate the failure. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure but provided no assistance. The failure mileage was 79,000.
What happened?  While driving my 2014 Honda Accord, both the brake and steering warning lights suddenly illuminated. The steering became difficult, indicating a loss of power steering assist. I pulled over safely and discovered that the ABS light remained on. After towing the vehicle to a service center, the technician confirmed that the ABS pump/module had failed, which triggered both warning lights and caused a failure in the power steering system. This malfunction poses a serious safety risk, potentially leading to loss of braking efficiency and steering control.  The failure was sudden, with no prior warning signs. The service center advised that the ABS module requires replacement.  Legal Protections and Manufacturer Liability:  As a consumer, I am protected under state lemon laws and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. These laws mandate that vehicles sold must be free from defects affecting safety and performance. The ABS pump/module failure directly compromises the vehicle’s safety, making Honda responsible for repair or replacement. I should not bear the cost of this repair, as the issue is a manufacturing defect.  Widespread Safety Issue and Call for Investigation:  It has come to my attention that thousands of 2014 Honda Accords are experiencing the same ABS pump/module failure, a clear safety issue that affects both the braking and steering systems. This is a widespread defect that Honda has yet to acknowledge with a formal recall. This issue appears to be purposefully hidden, and I urge Honda to initiate a thorough investigation and recall to address this danger.  If Honda does not act quickly, I will pursue legal action to ensure the safety of affected consumers, including complaints to regulatory bodies and potential class action litigation.
This was not a incident, I just want to report that for months now I have problems with the ignition it won't crank right away. I have got the ignition switch replaced and it is still doing it , it is a little better but not perfect.  I know their are a lot of complains about this, Please submit a recall on this.  Thank you,  Sincerely [XXX] INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
Was driving on highway and without warning the power steering system locked up and i was going 60 mph and almost lost control of my car. Yellow steering wheel with exclamation point light up on my dash board!
THE CAR INTERMITTANTLY WILL NOT START AND CAN LEAVE ME STRANDED. IT APPEARS TO BE A FAULTING IGNITION SWITCH AS THE STARTER WORKS FINE SO LONG AS THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM TURNS IT ON. THIS APPEARS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE THAT WAS RECALLED ON THE PREVIOUS 2013 MODEL AND APPARENTLY NOT FIXED WITH THE 2014 MODEL.
When turning switch to start car there is a click and car fails to turn engine crank. Takes multiple attempts to start engine.
On June second this year I started my Accord and drove on the freeway adjacent to my home for a few minutes and the ABS, traction control, and the brakes warning lights displayed on the dashboard. They went off after a few miles but continued displaying more frequently for a few days until I parked my car and got an appointment with my Honda certified mechanic. He told me this morning that the ABS control module needs to be replaced. Part and labor are $2,200. Current mileage is 70,480. By the way I felt a bumpy ride since the warning lights went on.  I appreciate your feedback and looking forward to hearing your response and advice.  Thank you, [XXX]  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).
When at low speeds especially when pulling into parking spot with wheel turned, wheel seems to stick, heat turns off and once parked, power steering makes squeaking noise.  Has occurred multiple times.  Realize there is already an investigation into this.  Unsure what issue may be.  Will likely take to Honda to ensure safe operation of vehicle.
ABS module failed, causing FCW, airbag, and traction control system to fail as well.  Without a functional ABS system, the likelihood of a crash increases.  Yes a dealer confirmed this failure, and has replaced the module.  Several warning lamps were illuminated.
My son was driving and the car just shut down.  When he tried to start the car it would not move no matter what gear you put it in ex. Drive,reverse. No warning lights came on. Had it towed to a Honda dealership and the said it was the transmission.  I have not had any problems prior to this either.
My Honda Accord 2014 only has 55,5000 miles .  For the last 3 months the starter is not working proper. In the last 3 months l had the battery changed, the rely switch changed.  Still the problem was still there. Then a new started was installed on 1/ 18/22 .   Many people with less miles are complaining about the started in their Honda Accord, and Honda is not recalling the starter.  I   am a single woman and l feel, l am, and everyone is being taken advantage of.  My first and last Honda.  I am shocked about the lack of service with Honda.  My starter total cost with labor was almost $400.00

THE STEERING HAS COMPLETELY FAILED
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 HONDA ACCORD. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE ABS AND SEVERAL OTHER UNKNOWN WARNING LIGHTS WERE ILLUMINATED. THE CONTACT TOOK THE VEHICLE TO GREGG ORR HONDA (4701 CENTRAL AVE, HOT SPRINGS, AR 71913, (501) 525-4565) WHO STATED THAT THE ABS MODULE FAILED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE HAD NOT BEEN REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE AND REFERRED THE CONTACT TO NHTSA. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 158,000. THE VIN WAS NOT AVAILABLE.
FEBRUARY 13, 2021 AROUND 11:45 I WAS DRIVING WITH MY SON AND HIS FRIEND & MY DOG WITH ME, I ABOUT TO MAKE A LEFT IN INTERSECTION WHEN I HIT THE GAS PEDAL I HEAR A NOISE UNDER MY CAR (BOOM) THEN THE CAR WON'T GO FOWARD EVEN THOUGH I HIT GAS. THEN I PUT IN REVERSE IT'S THE SAME THING IT WON'T STOP THE CAR ARE STILL MOVING BACKWARD SO I HIT THE BRAKE AND THE CAR STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF INTERSECTION. SO I PUT THE GEAR IN "P" PARK POSITION BUT THE CAR ARE STILL MOVING DOWN THE HILL. SLOWLY BY SLOWLY BACKWARDS AND THEN I HIT THE SNOW ON THE SIDE ROAD THAT'S WHY THE CAR STOP. I'M SO NERVOUS ON THAT MOMENT EVEN MY SON AND HIS FRIEND ARE SCARED.
PUSH START DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK. MY MECHANIC SAYS IT IS NOT THE STARTER
SAME ISSUE AS CASE #11339806 EXCEPT MY 2014 ACCORD'S PUSH-BUTTON STARTER FAILED AT LESS THAN 72,000 MILES.  THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THIS MODEL YEAR, TSB MC-10100621-6340.  COST OF REPAIR OVER $900.  THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL.
EVERY ONCE AND A WHILE I GET IN MY CAR AND TRY TO START IT UP AND IT WON'T START . IT TAKES SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE IT DOES START UP . YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT'S GOING TO NOT START BECAUSE IT DOES IT EVERY NOW AND THEN . I HAVE BEEN STRANDED MANY TIMES WAITING AND CONSTANTLY TURNING THE SWITCH TO SEE IF IT'LL START AND AFTER MANY TRIES, IT DOES . I HAVE REPLACED THE STARTER AND KEY FOB BATTERIES NEITHER ONE OF THEM WERE THE PROBLEM. AFTER REPLACING THE STARTER , MY KEY FOB STOPPED WORKING AND I CAN'T LOCK MY DOORS ANYMORE . I'VE ALSO TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT AND THEY TRIED TO REPLACE TWO OF THE FUSES BUT THEY BOTH BURNT OUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE PUT IN . I'VE ONLY HAD THIS CAR FOR TWO MONTHS AND IT FEELS LIKE I'VE HAD IT FOR YEARS THE WAY I'M HAVING PROBLEMS WITH IT .  *TR
TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS WITH ONLY 76,000 MILES.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 HONDA ACCORD. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE PUSH START FEATURE WOULD NOT START THE ENGINE. THERE WERE NO WARNING INDICATORS ILLUMINATED. THE CONTACT TOOK THE VEHICLE TO ESSERMAN LARGE HONDO (554 NEE  AVE, FLORIDA CITY, FL 33034, (844) 329-6036) TWICE. DURING BOTH VISITS, THE BATTERY WAS REPLACED; HOWEVER, THE FAILURE CONTINUED. THE CONTACT DISCOVERED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS INCLUDED IN NETS CAMPAIGN NUMBER:  (ELECTRICAL SYSTEM). THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 4,000.
WHY WOULD MY AIRBAGS NOT DEPLOYING WAY WHEN I WAS HIT WITH ANOTHER CAR TRAVELING ABOUT 45 MILES AN HOUR IN THE DRIVER'S PASSENGER FRONT FINGER
I NOTICE COUPLE OF WEEK AGO THAT MY CAR WOULD NOT START ON THE FIRST  PUSH BUTTON PRESS. THE COST HONDA DEALER GAVE ME FOR THE REPAIR WAS $755.00. I CALLED HIM BACK THE NEXT DAY TO INFORM HIM ABOUT ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE STARTER FOR THIS MAKE AND MODEL. I'VE READ AND PLAIN AS DAY HE SAY HONDA HAS NO REPORTS ABOUT THIS BEING A ON GOING ISSUES. I ALSO CALL THE HONDA CUSTOMER CARE LINE, AND AFTER BEING PLACE ON HOLD SEVERAL TIMES, I RECEIVED THE SAME ANSWER.
VEHICLE STARTS SPORADICALLY. VEHICLE HAS KEY IGNITION. ONLY ONE CLICK WHEN TURNING KEY. ELECTRICAL SYSTEM TURNS ON IE. LIGHTS, RADIO ETC. IT WILL START SOMETIMES AFTER A FEW TURNS OF THE KEY. SOMETIMES NOT AT ALL. BATTERY TESTED FINE, ALTERNATOR SYSTEM TESTED FINE, IGNITION SWITCH IS FINE, FUSES ARE FINE. FAULTY STARTER. EMERGENCY SERVICE PROVIDED BY INSURANCE COMPANY ATTEMPTED TO JUMP VEHICLE WOULD NOT START. NEEDED TO BE TOWED. STARTED AFTER 5 OR 6 ATTEMPTS FOLLOWING DAY. NOW IT TAKES NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS EVERY TIME. FAULTY STARTER NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS. HONDA NEEDS TO RECALL.
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
MY 2014 HONDA ACCORD LANECAMERA DOESN'T WORK OUT OF BLUE IT START WITH MY REVERSE CAMERA NOT WORKING NOT WRONG HAPPEN IT JUST STOP WORKING OUT OF BLUE PLEASE HAVE HONDA DEALER COVER IT BECAUSE IT'S A SAFETY ISSUE   THANK YOU
ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING FAILURE AT LESS THAN 90,000 MILES. HAD WE BEEN DRIVING AT A HIGHER SPEED, WE AND OTHERS ON THE ROAD WOULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED. WITHOUT ANY WARNING, THE ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING FAILED AND IT WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO STEER. IT TOOK ALL MY STRENGTH TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL.
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,    I'VE BEEN REVIEWING SEVERAL WEBSITE'S WHERE CAR OWNERS OF 2014 HONDA ACCORD SEDAN'S HAS REPORTED WHERE THE IGNITION WILL NOT TURN OVER WHEN YOU INSERT THEIR KEY. I HAVE TO TURN MY KEY AND TAKE IT OUT AT LEAST 5 TIMES IN OVER FOR THE IGNITION TO TURN OVER. THIS IS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR MY ESPECIALLY IF I'M STRANDED.  I WAS IN MY PARKING GARAGE ON 11/19/18 AT 5:30PM  WHERE MY CAR WILL NOT START. I HAD TO TAKE MY KEY OUT AND INSERT IT IN THE IGNITION FOR ABOUT 5 TIMES BEFORE IT TURNOVER.   MY CAR HAS HAD ITS ROUTINELY CHECK UPS AND I'M NOT SURE AS TO WHY THIS IS HAPPENING ALL OR SUDDENLY.  I'M NOTICING THAT THIS HAS BEEN HAPPEN FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS. WHEN I TAKEN MY CAR TO MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP- DUVAL HONDA ON CASSET AVE AND THEY STATED THAT NO ONE HAS REPORTED THIS ISSUE. HOWEVER I HAVE REVIEW PLENTY OF COMPLAINTS OF THE SIMILAR ISSUE THAT I'M HAVING.
I WAS NOTIFIED BY CONSUMER REPORTS OF RECALL JP2 FOR MY CAR SHOWING THE NEED FOR CONNECTING ROD BOLTS ON MY 2014 HONDA ACCORD. HONDA DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THIS AS A VALID RECALL
WAS BACKING VEHICLE OUT  OF A PARKING SPACE WHEN POWER STEERING FAILED SUDDENLY.
IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO START MY CAR.  LAST NIGHT IT WOULDN'T START.  WHEN IT FINALLY DID START ALL OF THE WARNING LIGHTS CAME IN AND WOULDN'T GO OUT.  THIS SAME THING HAS HAPPENED TO MANY OF MY FRIENDS THAT ALSO OWN 2014 HONDA'S.
REF PRIOR COMPLAINTS 11048722, 11035177, 11003743...    ON 1/9/18, A NEW REMANUFACTURED STARTER PURCHASED FROM HONDA, WAS INSTALLED IN THIS VEHICLE.  MILEAGE WAS 64740.  TODAY, 2/22/18, THE GRINDING NOISE OCCURRED ON ONE START ATTEMPT - THIS IS THE FIRST ISSUE WITH THE NEW STARTER - MILEGAE IS 65880.  SO, IN JUST OVER 1100 MILES, 1 1/2 MO, AND AN AVERAGE OF MAYBE 40 TO 50 STARTS/WEEK, THE PROBLEM IS RESURFACING.    I HAD THIS VEHICLE AT HONDA TO COMPLETE A PRIOR RECALL - ON 12/13/17 AND IT DID NOT START THERE.  SERVICE MANAGER MADE EXCUSE ABOUT THE REPLACEMENT STARTER NOT BEING FROM HONDA...  WELL - THIS ONE IS...    SOMETHING IN THE SYSTEM SOMEWHERE IS CAUSING THIS ISSUE.  WHILE IT MANIFESTS AS A MECHANICAL GRINDING, CLICKING NOISE, IT IS AN ELECTRICAL FAILURE IN THE SYSTEM AS HAS BEEN NOTED BEFORE, AND IT IS VERY RANDOM...    HOW AM I GOING TO BE ABLE TO RE-SELL A VEHICLE WITH SUCH A PROBLEM - A HONDA DESIGN FLAW HAS CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO THE CAR'S VALUE, NOT TO MENTION EXPENSES AND TIME LOST.    SEE OLD/NEW STARTER PIX...  PLEASE KEEP THE INVESTIGATION MOVING FORWARD - I HAVE SUFFERED A LOSS, AS HAVE MANY OTHERS!!
CONTACT GILLMAN HONDA IN HOUSTON, TEXAS REGARDING TAKATA AIRBAG INFLATORS RECALL. I WAS INFORMED BY THE DEALERSHIPS SAYING SUCH RECALL IS NOT EXISTING FOR MY VEHICLE.
TAKATA RECALL
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 HONDA ACCORD. PRIOR TO THE CONTACT RECEIVING NOTIFICATION OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 17V418000 (ELECTRICAL SYSTEM), THE CHARGE SYSTEM WARNING ALERT FAILED NUMEROUS TIMES. IN ORDER TO START THE VEHICLE, IT HAD TO BE JUMPSTARTED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE LOCAL DEALER (MAJESTIC HONDA, 1300 EDDIE DOWLING HWY, LINCOLN, RI, 02865) WHERE IT WAS NOT DIAGNOSED. THE CONTACT ALSO WENT TO TWO OTHER UNKNOWN DEALERS IN WARWICK, BUT THEY WERE UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE FAILURE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT CONTACTED OR MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 46,000.
LOST ALL POWER STEERING ON HIGHWAY. STEERING WHEEL WAS VERY VERY HARD TO TURN.
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS MY HONDA ACCORD EXL (2014) HAS BEEN GIVING ME TROUBLE WHEN I TRY TO START IT UP. I PUT IN A NEW BATTERY ABOUT 2 MONTHS AGO AND HAD IT TESTED SEVERAL TIMES. AT RANDOM TIMES WHEN I TRY TO START MY VEHICLE IT ONLY TURNS ON THE CONSOLE AND NOT THE ENGINE, AFTER I TURN IT OFF TO TRY TO START IT UP AGAIN THE BRAKE PEDAL SEEMS TO GET A BIT LOCKED AND IT ISN'T AS EASY TO PRESS DOWN ON IT.
GOODYEAR ASSURANCE FUEL MAX TIRES WITH 41,000 MILES ON A 2014 HONDA ACCORD HAVE PIECES OF RUBBER COMING OUT OF THEM. THE BALANCING AND ALIGNMENT ARE FINE AND AIR PRESSURE IS AT 33 PSI. TIRES ARE ROTATED AT EVERY SERVICE, APPROXIMATELY 5,000 MILES. I HAVE TRIED TO SEND PICTURES TO GOODYEAR HEADQUARTERS AND THEY REFUSE TO ALLOW ME TO DO SO. THEY ONLY ACCEPT THE WORD OF THE AUTHORIZED DEALER WHO STATED IT IS A RESULT OF DRIVING ON GRAVEL ROADS, WHICH HAS NEVER TAKEN PLACE. THEY WERE WILLING TO DO A PARTIAL WEAR ADJUSTMENT, BUT THEY WILL NOT GO THE 50% AS STATED IN THE WRITTEN WARRANTY.
TRUNK LID OPENS BY ITSELF INTERMITTENTLY.  THIS HAS OCCURRED ABOUT NINE TIMES SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR ONE YEAR AND A HALF AGO. THIS HAS HAPPENED WHILE PARKED IN MY GARAGE OR ON THE STREET NEAR MY HOUSE.  AFTER THE FIRST FEW TIMES IT HAPPENED I BEGAN TO REMOVE  THE KEYS FROM MY POCKET AND HANGING THEM ON A KEY HOOK UPON ENTERING THE HOUSE.  PROBLEM STILL OCCURRED. I FINALLY TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT THE CAR. THE DEALER SAYS THAT THEY CAN NOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND THAT HONDA AMERICA TECH SUPPORT HAS NEVER EVER HEARD OF SUCH A PROBLEM. I TOLD THEM TO DO A GOOGLE SEARCH. THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING MORE THEY COULD DO. I TOLD THEM THAT THE PROBLEM WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN IF NO CORRECTIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN. SO I INSISTED THAT THEY DISCONNECT THE ELECTRONICS FROM THE REMOTE TRUNK RELEASE. I HAVE TO OPEN THE TRUNK MANUALLY WITH THE TRUNK RELEASE CABLE BUT IT IS BETTER THAN LOOKING OUT YOUR HOUSE WINDOW AND SEEING YOUR CAR TRUNK FLAPPING IN THE BREEZE. LESSON LEARNED IS THAT HONDA AMERICA DOES NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT. AFTER THE WARRANTY PERIOD IS UP I WILL BE SWITCHING TO ANOTHER BRAND.
TRUNK LID HAS NO RESISTANCE AND HAS FALLEN ON US NUMEROUS TIMES CAUSING FACIAL/HEAD INJURIES. PROBLEM IS EXACERBATED WHEN PARKED IN OUR DRIVEWAY WHICH HAS A SLIGHT ELEVATION. IF LID IS NOT HELD MANUALLY, GRAVITY AND WEIGHT OF THE TRUNK LID FREE-FALLS.   IT HAS BEEN RETURNED TO TWO HONDA DEALERSHIPS FOR SUPPOSED "REPAIR" OR WE ARE TOLD "THAT IS THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE" -- AN AUTHORITATIVE STATEMENT FROM AMERICAN HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE TODAY (CASE NUMBER 04244825)." IN MY 54 YEARS OF CAR OWNERSHIP, INCLUDING MANY HONDAS, I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM.
I STARTED MY CAR IN PARK WHILE ON A HILL WITH EMERGENCY BRAKE ON. THE CAR STARTED MOVING A SECOND OR TWO BEFORE I RELEASED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE.  IMMEDIATELY,  I LOST MY POWER STEERING AND BRAKES. I STOPPED THE CAR BY PUTTING ON THE EMERGENCY BRAKE AND PUTTING THE TRANS MISSION IN PARK. THE TOTAL TRIP WAS ABOUT 100 YARDS. I NOTICED THAT 5 OR 6 WARNING LIGHTS WERE ON INCLUDING THE BATTERY.  THEN I QUICKLY TURNED THE ENGINE OFF. I WAITED FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES AND RESTARTED THE ENGINE AND EMBARKED ON A 25 MILE TRIP HOME WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.
WHILE DRIVING ON FREEWAY IN LIGHT TRAFFIC AND GOOD ROAD CONDITION, HEARD A SHORT RUMBLING SOUND AND THEN SAW TIRE ROLLING OUT FROM REAR MIRROR. A FEW SECOND LATER TIRE PRESSURE WARNING SIGN SHOWN. THIS HAPPENED ALL WITHIN  10 SECONDS. SINCE LOCATED JUST NEAR EXIT, I DROVE OFF AND PARKED ON SIDE.  I FOUND ONE REAR TIRE WAS COMPLETELY RIP OFF. THERE HAD BEEN NO ANY SIGN OF TIRE ISSUE BEFORE. CAR IS A FEW MONTHS NEW AND TIRE COMES WITH NEW CAR PURCHASE JUST ABOUT 7500 MILES. BROUGHT CAR TO GOODYEAR TIRE STORE FOR WARRANTY WORK AND WAS TOLD I MUST BRING TIRE TO CLAIM WARRANTY.

I COULD NOT RESTART UNTIL I PUT THE TRANSMISSION IN PARK.. DANGEROUS !!    I WAS LEAVING MY HOUSE WITH THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION IN DRIVE WHEN MY HAND GOING TO MY RIGHT KNEE HIT THE START BUTTON, THE CAR STOPPED!. FORTUNATELY I WAS GOING LESS THAN 5MPH SO NO ACCIDENT.

HEAD-REST PROBLEM -> NECK PAIN. AFTER DRIVING A FEW MILES, I NOTICE THAT NO MATTER WHICH POSITION I SELECTED  THE PILOT'S SEAT , MY HEAD IS ALWAYS PUSHED FORWARD MAKING A NECK PAIN. I TRIED TO ADJUSTED THE HEAD-REST WITH THE DIFFERENT POSITIONS I COULD MAKE MY NECK FEEL BETTER IN ALL I STILL CAN'T MAKE NECK PAIN GO AWAY EVERY TIME I DRIVE IT. IT'S REALLY PAINFUL MY HEAD IS ALWAYS LEANING FORWARD NO MATTER HOW I ADJUST THE HEAD-REST. THIS IS THE SAME PROBLEM I HAD FOR FORD-F150 TRUCK, THE HEAD REST ARE TOO BIG THUS MAKING ALWAYS THE HEAD LEAN FORWARD AND CAUSING ME A NEXT PROBLEM. IN BOTH VEHICLE, IT'S THE SAME. I CAN'T DRIVE COMFORTABLE!!!! WITHOUT STARTING TO FEEL THE NECK PAIN RIGHT AND FEEL MY HEAD IS BEING PUSHED FORWARD.  PLEASE HAVE HONDA AND OTHER MANUFACTURES REVIEW AND ADD A HEAD-REST ADJUSTMENT FEATURE TO THE HEAD-REST SO THAT WE CAN PUSH BACK THE HEAD-REST A LITTLE BACKWARDS TO ALLOW THE NECK/HEAD REST COMFORTABLE.   *TR
Odometer Fraud. The contact purchased a 2015 Honda Accord. The contact stated that while attempting to register the vehicle, it was discovered that there was a mileage discrepancy.

When the car is started up cold, it will sometimes start to stall on the road. Turning on and off the car usually gets it working correctly again. Usually will only happen if the temp is at or near freezing. 2015 Honda Accord EX. This has been. Happening for years, but Honda says that there’s no open recalls even though this seems to be similar to the recall (23V858000) from 12/17/2023.

I am original owner of vehicle, 125,000 miles, well maintained, no accidents. I would like to add to other owner complaints of, "Car is turning without input from driver". My sample turns right. I must actively resist the car in order to maintain my lane. There are no MILs illuminated in the instrument panel. I asked dealer to align the vehicle. Dealer claimed, "Cannot be Aligned", "Power Steering Rack is Leaking". I was skeptical of claim because I have "Electric" Power Steering System. I took vehicle to an independent mechanic. They found minor misalignment and successfully corrected that. The mechanic advised me that he found the vehicle is "wanting to turn right on its own". I have documentation from both establishments.
Power Steering did not work when I went out to my car. I took it to Honda and they replaced the power steering rod While I was driving it power steering failed again. Took it back to Honda - replaced electrical panel While I was driving power steering went out again. Back in shop with Honda and saying needs electrical harness repair. Dangerous to drive as you have no control over steering car while driving

VEHICLE BATTERY DIED , NO WARNING ABOUT HEALTH OF BATTERY
MY CAR HAS BEEN BURNING OIL AT AN EXCESSIVE RATE. THERE ARE NO LEAKS AND I GET THE OIL CHANGED EVERY THREE MONTHS REGARDLESS OF MILAGE. TODAY I CHECKED MY OIL AND IT WAS EMPTY. THERE WAS NO INDICATION LIGHT AND THE MORE I SEARCH ONLINE FOR SOLUTIONS, IT SEEMS THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE. I FEEL HONDA SHOULD FIX THE DEFECT.
I'VE RECENTLY NOTICED SMALL OIL SPOTS ON MY GARAGE FLOOR. MY CAR DOES NOT ACCELERATE SMOOTHLY AND HAS ALSO STARTED TO STALL WHEN I'M INITIALLY STARTING IT. THE STALLING SEEMS TO BE WORSE WHEN THE CAR HAS COOLED OFF BUT ONCE IT FINALLY STARTS, IT IS RUNNING ROUGH UNTIL I HIT A STABLE SPEED. IT ALSO SEEMS TO RUN ROUGHER WHEN MAKING TURNS (WHICH IS TYPICALLY WHEN I'M ATTEMPTING TO ACCELERATE). IT HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR THE PAST 3-6 MONTHS, ALTHOUGH INCONSISTENT. I'VE ALSO HAD A NEW BATTERY EVERY YEAR SINCE I'VE OWNED THIS VEHICLE DESPITE RECALLS ON BATTERY PARTS/SENSORS.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNED A 2015 HONDA ACCORD. CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING AT 60 MPH, THE ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING INDICATOR AND STABILITY ASSIST WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED. CAUSING THE CONTACT TO DRIFT TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD WHILE TRYING TO STEER THE VEHICLE. THE CONTACT LOST CONTROL CRASHED INTO A VEHICLE WENT ACROSS TWO LINES AND CRASHED INTO A CEMENT WALL. ALL AIR BAGS DEPLOYED. THE PASSENGER WAS THE CONTACT'S MOTHER AND SHE SUSTAINED BURSES AND A CONCISION ALSO A FRACTURED LEFT RIB. MEDICAL ATTENTION WAS REQUIRED. THE CONTACT SUSTAINED MINOR INJURIES BURSES ON BOTH ARMS. A POLICE REPORT WAS MADE. STATE FARM WAS CONTACTED AND TOWED THE VEHICLE TO A LOT WHERE THE VEHICLE WAS DEEMED A TOTAL LOSS. THE DEALER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS CONTACTED BUT NO ASSISTANCE WAS OFFERED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 76,000.
VEHICLE IS NOT STARTING WHEN I PUSH THE IGNITION. I'VE BEEN TO MANY FORUMS WHERE SIMILAR PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AND MANY SOLUTIONS TRIED BUT NO FIX FOUND. PEOPLE HAVE SPENT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO FIX THIS ISSUE AND STILL NO FIX.     I'VE  REPLACED THE BATTERY AND HAD THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM TESTED WITH NO ISSUE FOUND. HONDA ISSUED TSB 16-002 FOR V6 ACCORD MODELS BUT DOESN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE ON MY V4 MODEL.      VEHICLE IS PARKED - ISSUE HAS BEEN ONGOING AND IS GETTING PROGRESSIVELY WORSE TO THE POINT THAT I AM NOT DRVING IT!  SPOKE WITH HONDA CUSTOMER COMPLAINT REP AND INFORMED THAT THE TSB STILL DOES NOT APPLY TO MY CAR.      IN THE MID-WEST DURING THE WINTER MONTHS THE RISK OF BEING STRANDED IN SUB-ZERO TEMPS IS VERY REAL WITH THIS ISSUE AND HAS ALREADY HAPPENED TO ME TWICE.
THE CARS RADIO RANDOMLY REBOOTS AND FREEZES WHILE IN USE AND DRIVING. CALLS WILL DROP, DISPLAY WILL BLANK, AND RESET ITSELF. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WE HAVE TO PARK THE CAR, POWER IT OFF AND RESTART TO CLEAR THE ISSUE. HONDA TELLS US THERE IS NOTHING WRONG AND IT IS A NORMAL OCCURRENCE.
THE CAR SOMETIMES HAS TROUBLE STARTING.  I HAVE PURCHASED A NEW BATTERY AS THE ORIGINAL WENT BAD (THE ORIGINAL BATTERY WAS LESS THAN 3 YEARS OLD AND HAD AROUND 35,000 MILES).  THE PROBLEM SEEMED TO HAVE RESOLVED AND NOW A FEW MONTHS LATER THE CAR IS ACTING UP AGAIN.  IT ONLY HAPPENS INTERMITTENTLY AND I CANNOT REPRODUCE THE SYMPTOMS.  THIS IS BASICALLY A BRAND NEW CAR BUT IT SEEMS AS THE ALTERNATOR  OR STARTER IS BAD AND NEEDS TO BE RECALLED.
TAKATA RECALL  CAR DOES NOT WANT TO START SUDDENLY, IT HAPPENS AFTER IT RAINS USUALLY BUT TODAY IT DID NOT RAIN AND IT HAPPENED AGAIN   I READ REVIEWS OF OTHERS WHO HAD SAME PROBLEMS  ALL THE DASH SYMBOLS GO ON TOO  IT HAPPENS AFTER I SHUT CAR OFF AND SHORTLY TRY TO RESTART IT
2015 ACCORD HAS HAD STARTER PROBLEMS. IT HAD A THIRD STARTER INSTALLED AND WILL BE GOING BACK FOR THE FOURTH. IT HAS HAD STARTER ISSUES FOR OVER THREE YEARS. WILL CONTINUE TO REPLACE UNTIL HONDA STEPS UP TO PLATE AND FIXES ITS ISSUES.WHEN PRESSING THE START BUTTON  A CONTINUOUS GRINDING NOISE STARTS BUT THE CAR DOES NOT. IT MAY TAKE UP TO 20 TIMES TO FINALLY START THE CAR. SOMETIMES IT WON'T START AT ALL. DO NOT HAVE EXACT DATES OR MILAGE OF EACH OCCURENCE, HAS HAPPENED NUMEROUS TIMES.
I AM HAVING THE PROBLEM WHEN I GO TO START MY CAR IT CLICKS BUT WON'T TURN OVER UNTIL AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS. NEW BATTERY NOT THE PROBLEM ALL LIGHTS ARE WORKING .IT BEGAN AFTER I WENT AND HAD A BATTERY SENSOR RECALL DONE. AFTER SEVERAL REACH OUTS I SEE THIS IS A MAJOR COMPLAINT ON THIS YEAR OF VEHICLE.
THE RIGHT REAR DOOR DOES NOT OPEN WITH THE REMOTE, OR WITH THE LOCK/UNLOCK INSIDE BUTTON OR MANUALLY.  THE SYSTEM IS FROZEN ON THAT SIDE CREATING A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION FOR MY CHILDREN THAT HAVE TO TRAVEL IN THE REAR SEAT.  THERE IS NO WAY TO OPEN THE REAR DOOR IN CASE OF ACCIDENT/FIRE OR ANY OTHER EMERGENCY.
THE CAR WOULD GIVE A HARD TIME STARTING ONCE A WEEK, THIS STARTED 3 WEEKS AGO, THEN LAST WEEK IT JUST STOPPED TURNING ON, AFTER TRYING COUPLE OF TIMES , I TURNED IT ON, DROVE TO THE HONDA DEALERSHIP WERE THEY TOLD ME THAT I NEEDED A NEW BATTERY AND A NEW STARTER. THEY WOULD NOT COVER IT SINCE THE CAR PASSED THE 36,000MILES, IT HAD 42,000MILES. I NOTICED ANOTHER CAR SIMILAR TO MINE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AT THE DEALERSHIP, SO I WENT ONLINE TO RESEARCH THIS ISSUE AND FOUND OUT THAT HONDA KNEW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM HAPPENING QUIET OFTEN AND DID NOT ISSUE A RECALL  AS WELL AS THEM HAVING A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT REGARDING THIS MATTER. I HAVE DONE ALL THE WORK AT A HONDA DEALERSHIP AND HAVE DOCUMENTS AND RECEIPTS IT COSTED ME ABOUT 840$$ WHICH IS A LOT OF MONEY FOR A RELATIVELY NEW CAR.
BATTERY HAS LEFT ME STRANDED 3+ TIMES. NOT TO MENTION THAT I HAVE TAKEN IN THE CAR A FEW TIMES DUE TO ALL THE RE-CALLS ITS HARD. BATTERY AND ELECTRONICA BLUE TOOTH HAS ITS  ISSUES AS WELL. NOT KEEPING MY CONNECTION CLEAR AND WILL HAVE MY CALLS BECOME CHIPMUNKS CONNECTION AND LOUD NOISE ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR BLUETOOTH DEVISE FUNCTION USABLE & THAT IS A SAFE ROAD HAZARD, PLEASE ADVISE    [XXX]    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).'*JB

PAGE 1 OF 2 - I PURCHASED MY 2015 HONDA ACCORD COUPE EX-L WITH 2.4L CVT IN JUNE OF 2015 NEW WITH MAYBE 5 MILES ON THE ODOMETER. I STARTED HAVING ISSUES JUST MONTHS AFTER PURCHASING THE VEHICLE FROM BRANDON HONDA. THE FIRST INCIDENT OCCURRED WHEN PULLING OUT OF MY OFFICE COMPLEX ONTO A BUSY HIGHWAY WHEN THE CAR DECIDED TO JUST SHUT OFF CAUSING THE STEERING COLUMN TO ALSO SEIZE WHILE THE ODOMETER FLASHED "FCW FAILURE" ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER INSTRUMENT PANEL LIGHTS ON STEADY. SINCE THAT OCCURRENCE IT SEEMS AS IF I'VE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE. I HAVE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS TAKEN THE VEHICLE IN FOR REPEATED TRANSMISSION/FRONT END ISSUES ' SUCH AS JERKING BETWEEN RPMS, DOWN 'SHIFTING' FOR NO REASON CAUSING RPMS TO JUST DROP INSTEAD OF HOLDING WHEN RELEASING MY FOOT FROM THE ACCELERATOR AND WHILE TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY/INTERSTATE SPEEDS OF 55+ MPH, ETC. THE LAST 3 TIMES INCLUDED AN ADDITIONAL ISSUE WHERE THE GEARSHIFT WOULD GO FROM (D) DRIVE AND INTO (R) REVERSE WHILE CONTINUING TO GO IN A FORWARD MOTION WITH BACK UP CAMERA DISPLAYING ON DASH SCREEN AND (R) DISPLAYING ON THE ODOMETER WHERE THE GEAR IS DISPLAYED. THE DISCOVERY OF THIS SAFETY HAZARD TOOK PLACE FOR THE FIRST TIME ON AN INTERSTATE WHILE TRAVELING 65+ MPH. THE PASSENGER AT THE TIME WAS REACHING TO GRAB THEIR BEVERAGE FROM CUP HOLDER CLOSEST TO THE GEAR SHIFTER WHEN IT WAS HIT/TAPPED IN THE UPWARD MOTION ENGAGING THE TRANSMISSION INTO (R) REVERSE. IT TOOK ME A MINUTE TO GRASP WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE WHILE I'M LOOKING FORWARD INTO THE DIRECTION I'M DRIVING, I GLANCE DOWN AT THE ODOMETER AND NOTICE (R) IN PLACE OF THE (D) WHERE THE CURRENT GEAR ENGAGED WOULD BE INDICATED. THEN OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE I NOTICE THE CAMERA WAS ON DISPLAY BUT NOT REALIZING THE CAMERA WAS FROM THE REAR AND COULD SEE THE VEHICLES DIRECTLY BEHIND ME ON THE INTERSTATE.   *TR
WHEN I DRIVE MY CAR IT STALLS AND HESITATES WHEN ACCELERATING AND DRIVING. THERE IS A RECALL FOR THIS INVOLVING THE SHORT BOX AND IT CAN CAUSE AN ACCIDENT OR IF THE OLD LEAKS IT CAN CATCH ON FIRE. THE RECALL IS PRINTED ON THE INTERNET.  I WILL EMAIL IT TO YOU LATER AS I DO NAT HAVE IT WITH ME.  THIS HAS HAPPENED EVERY MONTH AND MANY TIMES EVERY MONTH.  THEY WILL NOT FIX IT AND THEY WILL NOT CALL ME BACK.  I WANT A NEW CAR UNDER THE LEMON LAW.  PLEASE HELP. OTHERS NEED TO KNOW THERE IS A DANGER HERE BUT THIS IS TOP SECRET.
SCIATIC NERVE PINCHING SEVERELY IN RIGHT LOWER BACK AFTER TWO MONTHS.  HIT DEER WITH CAR, TOYOTA RAV 4 RENTAL CAR, PROBLEM WENT AWAY.  NOW, CAR BACK, TWO WEEKS, PROBLEM RETURNING.  KEEPS GETTING PROGRESSIVELY WORSE, BOTH TIMES.  WORRIED BACK WILL GO OUT, NOT BE ABLE TO WORK.
I HAVE HAD THREE INCIDENTS IN THE 4500 MILES THAT I HAVE DRIVEN THE CAR WHERE THE SUN REFLECTS OFF OF THE SHINY PORTION OF THE CHROME CENTER CONSOLE AND BLINDS ME.  THIS IS UNSAFE AND CAN CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.  OTHER COMPANY'S USE NON-REFLECTIVE TO AVOID THIS.  I THINK IT SHOULD BE RECALLED.  I ALSO THINK FMVSS STANDARDS SHOULD ADDRESS THIS EXTREMELY UNSAFE CONDITION.  I THREW A RAG OVER THE PORTION OF THE CONSOLE TO PREVENT THE SUN FROM REFLECTING IN MY EYES SO I WOULD NOT HAVE AN ACCIDENT.
IT SOUNDS AS IF THE FRONT WINDOWS ARE OPEN EVEN WHEN THE CAR IS NOT MOVING.  BUT AT ESPECIALLY OVER 45 MPH, THE SOUND OF AIR WOOSHING INTO THE CABIN IS VERY PRONOUNCED.  IT IS AT EAR LEVEL ON BOTH THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE.  HONDA HAS REPLACED THE WINDOW RUN CHANNELS BUT THE NOISE IS STILL THERE.  THEY SAY THIS IS NORMAL OPERATION BUT CANNOT BE.  *JS

Headlight assembly
As I am driving my speakers (all of them) will randomly sound like static and its very loud and obnoxious. Its disturbing and can be a huge hazard while driving. I have looked it up and it seems tons of people are having the same issues in their 2016 and 2017 honda accords. Seeing how common it seems to be online in these cars i do not think its fair for us to have to pay for this issue…
There is a problem with the infotainment system. Apparently when the car is exposed to warmer temperatures, the sound system begins to produce static sounds from the speakers. The sound persists even with the radio turned off. The static is so loud, I have recorded decibel levels up to 90 on my Apple Watch. I have researched this problem and it is an issue that many owners have encountered. Honda has reacted to many owners as if they are unaware of this issue and charge customers to diagnose the problem and fix the issue at the owners expense. I am wearing ear plugs in order to drive my vehicle to and from work. In order to make the sound stop is to remove the fuse under the hood, which in turn dismantles safety features such as side view camera, AM radio, and the reverse camera. Honda denies knowing about this issue and it is extremely dangerous to drive this vehicle due to the deafening sound created from the speakers.
ABS MODULE VSA SOLENOID VALVE MALFUNCTION. The problem has been confirmed by dealership.
While traveling in New York City, several warning lights illuminated on the dashboard of my 2016 Honda Accord, including a red light for the brakes.  Upon returning home, my local dealer diagnosed the problem and determined that the vehicle stability assist (VSA) module failed and needed to be replaced.  I prepaid for the part; however, the dealer advised that the VSA module is on backorder and will not be available until November 5, 2023.  I feel that the delay of a critical brake component affects my safety and the safety of other motorists.  Therefore, I requests assistance with the immediate repair of the vehicle or alternate transportation until repairs are completed.
Wheels are known to collect dirt and it effects tire sensors
Driving about 40 mph on a city street with moderate traffic, and the car started to drift uncontrollably, as if sliding on ice.  I felt no control with the steering wheel. It lasted about 20-30 seconds.  No warning lights came on. I pulled into a service station, and checked the tire pressure and it was normal.  Continued on my way and no other problems.  I have not taken the car into the shop for any inspection as of yet. I felt that I was at extreme safety risk with the car drifting uncontrollably, had it veered into other lanes of traffic.
My car started making a piercing static noise that is so loud and you can’t do anything to turn it down and it is very hard to drive and concentrate with this noise.  I have seen other cars recalled for this issue but they are the larger cars.  My car has the same issue but they will do nothing for me.
BACK UP CAMERA DOESN'T WORK..SEEMS YEARS PRIOR TO AND AFTER 2016. NEEDS TO BE RECALLED
MY CAR KEEPS LOSING ALL POWER WHILE IM DRIVING AND THEN TURNS ON.
MY VEHICLES CRUSE CONTROL, LANE DEPARTURE, COLLISION WARNING AND LANE ASSIST COMPLETELY STOPPED WORKING AFTER BEING PARKED (STATIONARY) IN MY DRIVEWAY, VEHICLE HAS ALWAYS HAD PROBLEMS WITH FRONT SUSPENSION SINCE NEW AND BECOME UNSTABLE WITH BRAKING HARD IF ANOTHER DRIVER CUT ME OFF HAVING TO APPLY BRAKES OR WHEN APPLYING BRAKES DOWN HILL.. VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO DEAL FOR FRONT SUSPENSION BUT NEVER FIXED AFTER MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS UNDER WARRANTY.. THE LATEST ISSUE WITH DRIVER SAFETY SYSTEM IS A MANUFACTURERS FAILURE AS THESE ARE FEATURES SUPPOSEDLY TO PREVENT ACCIDENTS AND SO FOURTH ON PUBLIC ROADS AND HIGHWAYS. MY VEHICLE IS JUST OVER 4 YEARS OLD AND MAINTAINED AND SERVICED TO MANUFACTURES SPECIFICATION. IN RESEARCHING THRU THE WEB I FOUND HONDA OWNERS HAVING THIS SAME ISSUE WITH THEIR VEHICLE.  I BELIEVE HONDA SHOULD RECALL AND FIX THESE PROBLEMS ON THEIR VEHICLES COMPUTER / SOFTWARE OR SENSORS FOR PUBLIC SAFETY.  PART OF THE WEATHER DOOR WINDOW STRIPPING IS ALSO DETERIORATING.
AT 50,000 MILES MY LED LIGHT BURNT OUT
BOTH DAYLIGHT RUNNING LIGHTS (DLRS) STOPPED WORKING. THEY ARE HALF ILLUMINATED AND A SAFETY HAZARD. ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE AS IT IS HAZARDOUS.
I HAVE A 2016 HONDA ACCORD AND THE DRL ON THE PASSENGER SIDE HAVE BURNED OUT.  I HAVE BEEN DOING RESEARCH ONLINE AND THIS APPEARS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL AND THE 2017.  MY CAR IS APPROXIMATELY 2 YEARS OLD AND SHOULD NOT HAVE THIS ISSUE.  TO MAKE MATTERS WORST, THE ONLY WAY TO FIX IT IS TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE HEADLIGHT AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY 600.
PASSENGER SIDE DRL HAS QUIT WORKING. I AM OUT OF WARRANTY BASED ON MILEAGE NOT MONTHS OF TIME. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. HONDA DEALERSHIP WILL ONLY REPLACE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY (QUOTED AROUND $1,500 FOR 1 SIDE). I HAVE HEARD THAT THERE IS AN UPDATED DESIGN THEY ARE REPLACING THEM WITH. I WILL WAIT FOR THE DRIVER SIDE TO BURN OUT BEFORE CREATING AN ISSUE AT DEALERSHIP LEVEL. MANY COMPLAINTS AND MANY ACCORDS (ALL TRIM LEVELS) WITH THIS ISSUE. MY SERVICE ADVISOR SAID THAT THEY SEE SEVERAL EVERY WEEK! HONDA, DO THE RIGHT THING AND REPLACE THE DESIGN DEFECTIVE LIGHTS AT NO CHARGE!
DAYTIME LED LIGHT STRIP WENT OUT AT 40K MILES ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. THE DRIVER LIGHT WENT OUT AT 35K.
AT APPROXIMATELY 33000 MILES THE DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS WHICH ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY. BOTH HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLIES HAD TO BE REPLACED. I BELIEVE THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM (ONLINE COMPLAINTS). HONDA SHOULD REPLACE OR REPAIR THESE FREE OF CHARGE SINCE IT IS SUCH A WIDESPREAD OCCURRENCE.
THE LED RUNNING LIGHTS WAS BURNED OUT EASILY. LED RUNNING LIGHTS IS A SAFETY FEATURES OF THE VEHICLE THAT REQUIRES TO BE ON AT ALL TIMES PER DOT. THERE IS NO OPTION OF REPLACING THE LIGHTS. THE HONDA DEALER WANTS TO REPLACE THE WHOLE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY.
I GOT IN A CAR ACCIDENT AND ONE OF THE STRAPS POPPED OUT. IT WAS ALWAYS SNUG AND WIGGLED BEFORE. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS PRODUCT FOR A RECALL. LUCKILY ONE STRAP STILL HELD ON. WITNESSES SAID SHE WASN'T BUCKLED PROPERLY BUT I ALWAYS CHECK TO SEE IF THE BASE WIGGLES. (RELATED VEHICLE INFORMATION: MODEL YEAR=2016, MAKE=HONDA, MODEL=ACCORD) *BF  *TR
A PORTION OF THE LED DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS (DRL) IMMEDIATELY BELOW THE HEADLIGHTS ON THE DRIVER SIDE HAS BURNED OUT.  SHOULD NOT HAPPEN ON A CAR WITH ONLY 52K MILES.
TAKATA RECALL  WAS AGGRESSIVELY INJURED BY THE AIR BAG I FEEL THAT SHOULD NOT OF HAPPENED AND I FEEL IT ALSO SHOULD NOT OF GONE OFF THE ACCIDENT WAS MINOR

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2016 HONDA ACCORD. WHILE THE GEAR SHIFTER WAS IN REVERSE, THE VEHICLE FAILED TO REVERSE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER, BUT WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED.

THE REAR WINDOW IS DISTORTED WHEN YOU LOOK THROUGH IT. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S SUNNY OR RAINING OUT IT LOOKS ALL WAVY. IT ALSO DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER WHETHER THE WINDOW IS TINTED OR NOT. I THINK THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD  AND YOU CANNOT SEE OTHER VEHICLES CLEARLY WHILE LOOKING THROUGH YOUR REARVIEW MIRROR. I HAVE SEEN MANY OTHER COMPLAINTS SO I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING HUNDRED NEEDS TO ADDRESS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE ACCIDENT OCCURS IF IT HASN'T ALREADY.
SEATS ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. THE DRIVERS SIDE SEAT CAUSE MY LEGS TO GO NUMB AND ALSO HURTS MY LOWER BACK.
On the passenger side the seat burst and the airbag curtain deployed. It is available for inspection upon request. This happened at [XXX] while dark. This has not been reproduced, but it has been confirmed by the Honda Service station. The car was inspected at Brannon Honda in Birmingham Al. There was no warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure.  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
Driver door and driver side rear door lock actuators both failed very untimely.  Car has 55,000 miles on it and is garage kept and accident free.  I needed to replace both components as the doors would not lock or unlock and posed an extreme safety hazard.  Also the alternator needed to be replaced very untimely making me feel as though there are further electrical issues with this vehicle.  I contacted Honda and have not received a response in over two weeks.
There appears to be a model-wide problem with 2017 Honda Accord audio system that manifests in screeching static noise through audio speakers (whether the radio is turned on or not) at decibels in excess of 100 (sounds like a lawnmower being operated inside a closed 4 door sedan).  This noise comes with no warning (or waring lights) and shocks the senses that can cause erratic vehicle operation.  Once the noise starts, it will last varying lengths of time that include in excess of 12 minutes.  The only means to make it stop is by turning off the car, which is not easy or safe if highway driving.  The screeching is so loud, it is impossible to hear emergency sirens or honking horns, making this a serious safety issue.  This is also very distracting -- imagine a passenger screaming in your ear as loud as they can non-stop -- simply not conducive to safe driving!  Honda of America acts like they have never heard of this issue (I can see that many, many 2017 Accord owners have reported this very issue over the last several years).  Dealer diagnostics reveal nothing.  They only recommend replacing the entire audio head unit ($4K) and owner expense.  For a car that is only 7 years old, it is not working as intended.  A recall seems warranted.  This has been going on over a month now and is getting progressively worse.  Please help us.  [XXX]  Please open this video to hear the problem.

The headlight assembly DRL (Daytime Running Lights) LEDs are burnt out and have melted due to daytime lights running too hot. These are a complete sealed assembly and need to be replaced as a unit due to mechanical failure from manufacture defect.
The vehicle turn off and on while driving on the highway, is like the engine stall while driving, increasing the risk of a crash or injury. I'm aware there's no recall on my vehicle, however, it's a known issue that Honda had voluntarily recall approximately 2.6 million 2017-2020 Honda vehicles in the United States to replace their fuel pumps, for free due to a similar issue.    I have experience this issue of the vehicle shutting down then on while driving in the last couple of weeks and it's increasing each day.  The accord was bought for my son to use, if he encounter an accident due to this fuel pump issue and he lose his life, someone would have to be held accountable.
The contact owns a 2017 Honda Accord. The contact stated while accelerating from a stop light, the vehicle stalled. The contact continued to depress the accelerator pedal before the vehicle accelerated as needed. No warning lights were illuminated.  The vehicle was taken to the dealer however, the dealer was unable to determine the cause of the failure. The contact stated that the failure persisted. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 20,000.
My 2017 Honda Accord V6 touring has been experiencing hesitation for the last several years. I know there’s a recall, but why is my car not being recalled I’m having the exact same problems that I described call hesitates stalls sometimes hard to start.
About 3 months ago, the emergency brake light, traction control light, ABS light and power steering light started coming off and on, they now stay on all the time. I took and had it checked, CODE 121-11 for the VSA Solenoid Valve Malfunction. Had it checked for a program update I was told that there wasn't an update and the part to fix it has been on backorder from Honda for at least two years. (I notified Honda about this) I have a very strange sound when applying the brakes on a cold start and I can also feel a jerk in the brake pedal.   Also noticed that oil is leaking around the engine cover and was told that it is a manufacturing issue with Honda. The cover is plastic and over the years, the plastic shrinks and causes a small oil leak. Replacing the cover and gasket would fix this.
The contact owns a 2017 Honda Accord. The contact stated that while driving approximately 30 MPH the vehicle suddenly started to jerk, hesitate, and would not properly accelerate while depressing the accelerator pedal. The vehicle was later driven to the local dealer who diagnosed the vehicle and determined that the high-pressure fuel pump was faulty and needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not yet repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure, but no assistance was offered. The failure mileage was 33,000.

Traffic was traveling at around 55 miles per hour. The car in front had to make a quick stop to avoid hitting a flagger that could not be seen due to the sun. My car that is equipped with Hondas forward collision mitigation system did not respond. I pressed the brakes myself but did not stop in time resulting in an accident. The system does activate randomly while driving and will slam the brakes when no objects are in the path of the vehicle.
If the car sits idle for more than 4 days, the battery dies. The car has 60,000 miles and we are replaced the battery once and it continues to die if it sits for more than 4 days.  The car pulls to the right side regardless of how many times I have it balanced.   The LED day running light on the driver side front died when the car only had 50,000 miles on it.

BACKUP SYSTEM NOT WORKING
LAST NIGHT I HAD JUST GOTTEN HOME FROM WORKED AND GONE IN THE HOUSE TO CHANGE FOR CHURCH. LESS THAN 5 MINUTES LATER, I RETURNED TO MY CAR AND WHEN TRYING TO START IT, IT WOULD START UP. LIGHTS FLICKERED ON DASH, BUT IT WOULDN'T TURN OVER. HAD ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE COME TO JUMP START CAR. LESS THAN 24 HOURS LATER, THE SAME THING HAPPENED. CAR WON'T START AFTER DRIVING THIS MORNING AND THIS AFTERNOON ALREADY.  THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THIS HIS HAPPENED  THIS YEAR, WITH IN A FEW MONTHS. CAR HAS LESS THAT 50K MILES. THIS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO BECAUSE IF I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, THIS COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS.
CAR SUDDENLY WONT START.  BREAK PETAL IS STUCK, DASH LIGHTS CLICK AND WONT START. ACTS LIKE ITS THE BATTERY BUT DOESN'T ALLOW JUMP. CAR HAS LESS THAT 46,000 MILES AND IS 2 YRS OLD. CURRENT RECALL OUT FOR FUEL ISSUES, BUT THE DEALER IS SURE THATS NOT THE CAUSE. CONTACT AT THE DEALER WAS NOT HELPFUL AT ALL AND KINDA RUDE. RUSHED ME OFF THE PHONE WHEN I WAS ASKING QUESTIONS. VERY UPSET
THE FRONT RIGHT WHEEL/TIRE HAS A GRINDING NOISE.  SOUNDS LIKE BAD WHEEL BEARING.  MAINLY HEARD AT LOW SPEEDS BUT IS GETTING LOUDER OVER TIME.  HONDA SAYS IT IS THE CONTINENTAL TIRES.  TIRE SHOP PUT DIFFERENT WHEELS AND TIRES ON THE CAR AND THE NOISE DID NOT GO AWAY.  THE NOISE DOES NOT FOLLOW THE TIRES,  TIRE SHOP SPIN BALANCES THE TIRES ON THE CAR.  THEY SAID THE FRONT LEFT WHEEL IS MAKING A ROARING GRINDING NOISE.  THIS IS WITH THE WHEEL  AND TIRE OFF THE GROUND.  HOW CAN TIRES MAKE A METAL GRINDING NOISE.  HONDA DEALERSHIPS WILL NOT FIX THE PROBLEM
I HAVE STARTED TO HAVE THIS STRANGE ENGINE START ISSUE RECENTLY (WITH SHORT CIRCUIT SOUNDS). DEALERSHIP SERVICE DONE IN JULY FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR OR MY IGNITION SWITCH. DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE A CRITICAL ISSUE ' IT IS NOW LEAVING ME STRANDED ON THE ROADS. I DON'T SEE ANY RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE EITHER. I'M GLAD I NOTICED DURING SUMMER AS OTHERWISE COULD BE LIFE THREATENING ISSUE. I HAVE DESCRIBE THE EVENTS IN DETAILS IN THE ATTACHED PDF.
I HAVE A CONTINUOUS SOUND IN MY DRIVERSIDE FRONT TIRE IT HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE I PURCHASE THE CAR THEY TOLD ME IT WAS SOMETHING THEY CAN FIX BUT IT ONLY STOP THE SOUND FOR A LITTLE WHILE SO I HAVE A BRAND NEW CAR THAT HAS A WHOPPING SOUND IN IT AS I GO DOWN THE ROAD THEY TOLD ME IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE RIM BUT IT WAS TOTALLY SAFE I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS OF GETTING IT FIXED BECAUSE THEY SAID I WOULD HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THEY RECALL IT'S DONE BEFORE THEY CAN FIX THE PROBLEM I DO NOT THINK IT'S FAIR THAT I HAVE BOUGHT A BRAND NEW CAR THAT HAS A ISSUE AND NO ONE IS CONCERNED ABOUT FIXING.
THE DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHT LED BAR WENT OUT ON MY DRIVERS SIDE AROUND 30K MILES, NOW THE PASSENGER SIDE HAS GONE OUT AROUND 35K MILES.  THE DRIVERS SIDE WAS REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY BUT HAVE NOT GOTTEN TO TAKE IT IN YET FOR THE PASSENGER SIDE.
I PURCHASED A NEW VEHICLE THRU A HONDA DEALERSHIP, WHICH IS 4 HOUR DRIVE FROM MY RESIDENCE. I'VE HAD TO GET VEHICLE JUMPSTARTED ON 4 OCCASIONS AND HAVE TAKEN VEHICLE TO A LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP TO GET IT INSPECTED UNDER WARRANTY TERMS. THE DEALERSHIP HAS ONLY REPLACED BATTERY TWICE YET HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO PINPOINT PROBLEM. DRIVER SIDE DOOR LOCK/UNLOCK BUTTON ALSO HAS BEEN MALFUNCTIONING AND TEMPERATURE GAUGE HAS ALSO BEEN MALFUNCTIONING. I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH HONDA FINANCE CORPORATION CASE MANAGER BY THE NAME OF KIA WHO HAS BEEN GIVING ME RUNAROUND ALONG WITH LOCAL DEALERSHIP, UNABLE TO SOLVE VEHICLE DEFECT/SAFETY ISSUE. THEY NOW SUGGEST I TAKE VEHICLE TO ORIGINAL HONDA DEALER OF PURCHASE WHICH IS A 4 HOUR DRIVE AND HAVE THEM REMOVE AFTER MARKET ALARM THEY INSTALLED WHICH MIGHT SUPPOSEDLY BE CAUSING ELECTRICAL PROBLEM. HOWEVER, IT IS SPECULATION AND DRIVING LONG DISTANCE IS A HARDSHIP FOR ME AND VERY UNFAIR. I FEEL LIKE LOCAL HONDA DEALER SHOULD FIX PROBLEM. THIS IS A HUGE CAR SAFEY ISSUE THAT HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED. YOUR ASSISTANCE AND GUIDANCE IS VERY APPRECIATED.
I BOUGHT 2017 HONDA ACCORD AND WITHIN A DAY THERE WERE 2 AIR BAG SIGNS CAME UP. CALLED DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID WHENEVER YOU COME THIS SIDE BRING THE CAR. THEY CHECKED THE CAR THAT WEEKEND AND FOUND A FAULTY SRS MODULE. THEY REPLACED IT, BUT HOW A NEW CAR HAVE A FAULTY SRS MODULE? HOW QUALITY CONTROL DEPT. STAMPED IT WITHOUT CHECKING IT? WHAT IF SOMETHING WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ME?
my 2018 Honda Accord is having major engine problems. Earlier this year all of the lights were coming on, 7 of them at a time, and that happened for a few weeks before it started overheating. If I was driving over 50mph, it wouldn't overheat, but if I was driving slow or idling, it was overheating within minutes. I took it to the shop in June where they discovered there was NO COOLANT inside the engine. they put 1.5 gallons of coolant in there, and it fixed the problem temporarily, but 2 weeks ago, all of the lights started coming on again. I called my mechanic, and he said his friend had a 2018 Honda Accord that was doing the same thing and that we need to approach Honda and ask them to fix the problem. turns out a lot of other people on the internet are reporting the exact same problem in their 2018 Honda Accords too, and there's even a class action floating somewhere out there because coolant is leaking into the chambers. we already had a fuel injector recall replaced by Honda last year.
If car is idling for over 1 minute, all lights on dash come on. When all lights on, car wont wont go over mph, car will randomly sputter in highway when going over 1rpm and will stall randomly. Reported on reddit by multiple people and when I went in to get it diagnosed it was the fuel injector issue
While attempting to pass a slower vehicle in my 2018 Honda Accord with a 1.5L engine, the suddenly lost power and stalled down to 20 mph while I was alongside the other vehicle. This unexpected power loss put my life and the lives of others at serious life threatening risk. I immediately brought the care to a Honda dealership, where the tech was able to reproduce the issue. The performed a borescope inspection and confirmed that coolant was present inside one of the cylinders, indicating a failed cylinder head gasket.  This type of failure should not happen, especially on a vehicle like this. I was the repair would cost $6,500. After researching, I learned that this is a known defect affecting the 1.5L engine and that multiple class action lawsuits have been filed. I also discovered that American Honda is aware of the problem and has instructed dealership service departments to report affected vehicles. In fact, they have even offered gift cards to service advisors who report these cases, but are charging customers for the repairs. That's nonsense. Just do a simple google search and you will discover what I did.  During the failure, the check engine light and several other warning lights came on but only the check engine remained on. Since then the car has multiple indicator lights on. Despite multiple attempts to follow-up, the dealership has refused to return my calls. This is a serious life threatening safety concern that deserves immediate investigation. Thank you.

July 10th Honda went into limp mode  as I accelerated would not drive over 20. Check engine light flashed on then off. Have taken car in several times no codes can be read. Believe it’s cylinder issues or fuel possible head gasket. All vehicle lights has displayed  haven’t been able to get reads once car is turned off. Too many issues with no repair fix.
The Head Gasket is leaking at 135k miles after changing oil and filter every 5k miles and flushing coolant every 50k. Just a cursory internet search will show you how obvious the design defect is in the head bolts of the 1.5 liter turbo engine and they should be recalled.
• Head gasket  • None of the safety features work when there is a head gasket issue. Power steering is reduced as well as break performance • Confirmed by Honda dealership with a Boroscope • Honda • No warning, Honda at first thought it would be fixed by fixing the factory recalls. Light went away prior to taking it in and then looked in to it 2 weeks later and diagnosed head gasket failure

I recently experienced a power steering failure on my 2018 Honda accord 1.5t sport. When going to pull into a parking spot when turning my wheel to the left the power steering failed leaving me on the road. With all the lights coming onto the dash unable to pinpoint a specific issue. Upon taking it to the dealer I was informed that I needed a new “gearbox, steering”. More specifically the rack and pinion needed to be replaced. They sent me a quote for $6,233.73. As I was unable to afford this I looked Into this issue. As this has been a problem for Hondas my car wasn’t qualified for a recall upon looking at the nhtsa website. I am able to provide proof and documentation of the quote with price parts and labor.
Three times, while driving, the car went into limp mode and would not accelerate. Had to pull over, turn car off, and back on to fix the issue. Have had it looked at and they have mentioned engine coils and a new control module. Had it at the dealership in January and they did their full inspection and to fix fuel pump recall and didn’t mention any issues regarding this.
OPEN RECALL ISSUES   I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally express my concern regarding the unresolved recall issue with my 2018 Honda Accord. I am a resident of Columbus, Georgia, and have made multiple attempts to have this recall addressed by the local Honda dealership in Columbus, Georgia, but have encountered persistent difficulties.  I have visited the dealership several times inquiring about when my recall can be fixed. On one occasion, I was informed that the manager stated the recall could not be addressed unless my car was experiencing visible issues. Despite explaining that I was already experiencing some of the issues outlined in the recall, I was denied service. A few months later, when I visited again, I was told that no parts were available for the recall. When I called a few weeks after that, my calls went unanswered.  Most recently, after the birth of my child, I visited the dealership once again and was told that all parts for the recall were out of stock. I requested to be put on a list to be contacted once the parts became available, as I am concerned about the safety of my vehicle and the need to have the recall honored. Despite these repeated efforts, I have not received a resolution, and I believe my consumer rights are being disregarded.  As per Georgia’s consumer protection laws, including those concerning automobile safety and recall procedures, manufacturers are required to honor recalls and ensure that necessary parts are available in a timely manner. The continued lack of response and failure to address this issue is concerning, especially given the potential safety risks involved. Please do note and keep in mind that I have came to the Honda business about 3 times . I am undecided of the actual  dates but the year was 2024 . I know I went before I had my baby in September and after I had my baby  I received a minor inspection due to me complaining.
Last year I got new Gaskets which wasn't cheap july 2024 all sudden now its losing power after accelerating and constantly burning out spark plugs these engines are terrible I've seen so many people with the same complaints and it's becoming a pain something needs to be done about this I feel it's dealing with the 1.5t engine  Today I while accelerating check engine and lost power during busy traffic im in the road having cut the car off and restart it then it goes back to driving right and my son and 2 grandkids were in the vehicle very dangerous Honda needs too check 2018-2022 1.5t vehicles this is a safety issue that needs fixed immediately ty

3 days and 26 miles after picking up my car following the repair for the issue reported in NHTSA  issue #11614854, my car again displayed a bunch of various errors on the dashboard and threw P0300, P0301, and P0304 codes via OBDII. I dropped off the car at the dealership and they report that the issue this time is bad fuel injectors.  This car has now had 2 major premature powertrain failures before reaching 70k miles that can result in loss of power while operating the vehicle. Losing power on the highway is a serious safety issue so I wanted to report this to the NHTSA for your records.

My 2018 Honda Accord began malfunctioning on [XXX]. It completely stalled out and all of the warning lights came on. The vehicle was being driven and began to shudder upon acceleration at just 15 mph. The vehicle ended up seizing and lost all acceleration capabilities. The vehicle was able to be pulled over at idle speed and had trouble starting. once I got the car to start, I was able to drive the vehicle into a safe parking lot but only at idle speed as the acceleration was not functioning. I had received the fuel pump recall and had the car towed to Brandon Honda in Brandon FL, and they determined it was not a fuel pump failure but a blown head gasket. I also received a second opinion that confirmed this diagnosis and determined the issue to be the blown head gasket causing coolant to mix with my oil and leak into spark plugs causing spark plug 3 to fail as well. Upon replacement of the spark plug, the car functions once again with acceleration capabilities, however, to prevent any further damage, I had the car towed back to my place of residence. Upon further investigation, I am finding more people experiencing this issue with their new Honda Accords as well. The head gasket should not fail this early on in owning this vehicle especially being the only owner of this vehicle and only 130k miles. I have always kept up with coolant levels, and oil changes, and used the recommended octane by Honda, 87. Repair still has not been made as I am exploring all of my options, however, if this malfunction had happened on the interstate, it could have been fatal.

Over the past two weeks, I have encountered problems with my car's many lights. These issues have been related to issues with the braking system, collisions, road departure, emission system, ACC system, vehicle stability, and electric power system. By disconnecting the battery, the lights have been switched off. My car can only be operated in this manner.)  The automobile would not go faster, and I was stuck in traffic, endangering my safety.  There might have been an accident if someone had been speeding.   This had happened before, and when I called the Honda store in Milledgeville, Georgia, to report the problem, they said they were unable to locate a problem because the lights had vanished.   Yes, Butler Honda in Milledgeville reported that they were unable to locate a problem. The mechanic informed me that it was OK to drive even if the car had lights on because they couldn't use the car today. However, a few days later, the lights had vanished once more.   It occurred approximately once in July 2023, twice in December 2023, once in March 2024, and once in April 2024.  Before the several lights, there was no warning light.

The contact owns a 2018 Honda Accord. The contact stated that while driving at an undisclosed speed, the vehicle began to shake, after which the vehicle inadvertently lost motive power. The contact was able to coast to the shoulder of the roadway, where the vehicle was able to be restarted. After restarting the vehicle, the vehicle returned to normal functionality, but the failure became a regular occurrence. Several unknown warning lights were illuminated. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic, who determined there was a misfire in cylinder #3. The vehicle was not repaired. After investigating the failure, the contact related the failure to NHTSA Campaign Number: 23V858000 (Fuel System, Gasoline). The VIN was included. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was 93,000.
Took my car for recall last week. Dealership isn't helping me. Spend so much money to fix something that's defecting parts of my engine. But dealership is ignoring me.
2018 Honda Accord has a poor fitting hood.  The issue is not unique to Accords.  On Honda Pilots around the same year, supposedly a "fix" was issued where some sort of a tape was used to stabilize the hood.  At highway speeds, the hood experiences visible deflection/vibration-like movement.  Yes, the stop towers and the latch have been checked and adjusted by a qualified body shop, who, essentially, indicated that there is nothing else that can be done.
The contact owns a 2018 Honda Accord Sedan. The contact stated that while driving at an undisclosed speed, the low coolant warning light illuminated on the instrument panel, prompting him to refill the coolant reservoir. It returned to normal functionality, but around 10,000 miles later, while driving at an undisclosed speed, the vehicle lost all motive power. The contact was able to coast to the shoulder of the roadway, where the vehicle failed to restart. The vehicle was towed to the dealer, who diagnosed a failure with the head gasket and found that the engine block was cracked at cylinder three. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure, and a case was opened. The failure mileage was 70,000.
The vehicle had a very violent shift (perhaps it was turbo lag related?) at low speed (under 20 miles per hour - typically, this happens in a parking lot or the like as you slowly drive away). In the past, this had been mentioned to the dealer, numerous times, who claimed that the issue is not reproducible.  However, during the visit on 12/06/2022, dealer mechanic(s) claimed that they did witness the issue and the fix the performed the following (per dealer's notes):  "reset TCM and Batter cable reset." after which (the dealer notes state): "Let the customer know that the trans will adapt to driving habits within 200 miles. If the customer drives hard, the transmission will learn hard to shift hard etc..."  The second statement is nonsensical, since, most of the time the transmission shifts relatively fine, regardless of the driving pattern (i.e. hard, mellow, etc.) and the issue happens intermittently (every so many hundreds miles driven), at very low speeds with very little accelerator input, which indicates more of a software issue (and, possibly a mechanical design defect, coupled with the SW issue).  Again, Honda has refused to properly troubleshoot and address the issue.  There are now other customers with, what sound like, a very similar problem:  [XXX]   And, just as with my vehicle, other dealers are claiming "there is no issue" and Honda has ignored the issues.  Honda has a history of transmission problems from the 2000s and it's really worrying that they might be repeating that pattern with 2018-on models: [XXX]   While I am noting the issue at this mileage, there are numerous other instances of where the same problem occurred.  The violent manner in which these shifts happen, makes one wonder how much mechanical damage is being done to the transmission and if a recall should be issued.

On about 7-10 occasions since purchasing car new, the automatic braking system will engage brakes for no reason.  These have all been in cuise control mode and with no cars in front of me.  It is a very hard braking and a many of the times on interstates going 70 MPH.  Have no idea why it does this, but definitely feel it is unsafe and makes me wary of this situation happening in the future (as I'm sure it will).
My acc went out along with my collision mitigation system and no accident just for no reason.

The vehicle's safety system (not sure if it's the camera mounted behind the windshield or something else) will periodically interpret a road speed sign as showing 100mph speed limit. This has happened before and will have happened again (I am filing this complaint after some time has passed). As with a number of other issue with the 2018+ Honda models, Honda's response has been "take it to the dealer" while the dealer's mechanic drives the car for an hour, does not see the issue and then claims that nothing is wrong with the vehicle. A picture is attached.
The contact owns a 2018 Honda Accord. The contact stated while driving 60 MPH with the cruise control activated, the vehicle abruptly stopped with unknown warning lights illuminated. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was not contacted. The failure mileage was approximately 45,000.  The contact stated that at the time of the incident, the automatic braking system engaged by itself most likely due to the fact that a car was really close to the vehicle and possibly sensed danger.
The contact’s wife owns a 2018 Honda Accord. The contact stated that on numerous occasions while he or his wife was driving at various speeds, the vehicle stalled. The contact stated that he was able to maneuver the vehicle off the road however, he had to wait several minutes to restart the vehicle. The check engine warning light was illuminated followed by several unknown warning lights being intermittently illuminated. The vehicle was taken to several unknown dealers however, the cause of the failure could not be determined or duplicated. The failure recurred. The vehicle was not repaired. The contact referenced NHTSA Campaign Number: 20V314000 (Fuel System, Gasoline). The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 82,000.
The parking brake will randomly disengage when the car is parked, so I have to leave it in gear as a backup.
I have had this vehicle since June 2018 and I have not had any issues until the last month or so. The first incident happened while driving to work and it was raining, when I turned into the parking lot a number of warnings started going off : Electric Parking Brake System Problem, Brake System Problem, Brake Hold System Problem, Electric Power Steering System Problem, Adaptive Cruise Control System Problem. Parked my car, went in my office and called the dealership. They told me it was most likely because of the rain and that the issue should resolve on it's own. By lunch time it had stopped raining, went to get lunch and the warnings were gone, but now when accelerating I would lose power. So I go the the dealership, they check to see what the issue is and they can't find anything. Told me to come back if it does it again. Few weeks later, driving down the interstate going 75 and I start losing speed for no reason and car almost crashes into me due to the dramatic decrease in speed and once again all the warnings are back on - but it's not raining this time! Honda can't find any issues and I'm so frustrated because it's a danger to me!
Driving at 70 mph on interstate 74 in cruise control the vehicle automatically braked on its own nearly causing a rear end collision by the semi following.  Vehicle then proceeded to de-rate down to 40 mph and would not accelerate beyond this causing us to drive down the highway with our hazards on over an hour home.    Additionally, after making it home every warning lights for adaptive cruise control, collision mitigation, power steering assist, lane keep assist, etc. continue to come on and off.  Vehicle was just at the local Honda dealership where they did a recalibration, to which I just picked up and within 10 miles of driving the vehicle every warning light is back in and vehicle de-rated again.    Vehicle is very unsafe to drive and at this point a danger to myself, family and others on the road.
Two times while driving on the highway at 75-80 mph with CMBS system on and utilizing ACC. Out of nowhere, vehicle drops speed, ACC OFF notice comes on and an alert stating Collision Mitigation Braking System Problem. See dealer pops up. . At this point, I have to quickly react to increase speed on gas pedal and avoid someone hitting me from behind. I am not able to re-engage the ACC the remainder of the travel. After turning off the vehicle, the CMBS resets and ACC is available again. This is not possible to do while driving on a highway. The second time it happened, I was changing lanes into the passing lane on left and I seriously could have been hit due to my speed deceleration. I took the vehicle straight to the dealer and the guy checking me in said they get a lot of those system errors. This is not reassuring! They ran a diagnostic, step by step the advisor said, only to say the system shows no issue. This is not acceptable to me as I do not feel safe driving. In addition, the lane keeping assist LKAS feature also malfunctions. When there are shadows on the road, my car wants to swerve and steer me incorrectly. My car also will display a giant orange BRAKE warning when nothing is in front of me. One time it braked so hard that my seatbelt locked up and everything on my passenger seat slid off the seat. Thankfully, nobody was immediately behind me because I could have been hit for the sudden and unanticipated braking.
Routine and ongoing false and nuisance braking warnings from collision mitigation system.  Triggering of the warning is presumably a precursor to erroneous activation of automatic braking.
While driving my vehicle at approximately 25 miles per hour on a cloudy day with temperatures around 55 degrees, I heard a loud bang.  Apparently my sunroof exploded without any debris around.  As you can imagine, this shocked me and caused a brief panic as to what had just happened. I hope that this would be something that can be avoided in the future for all drivers of Honda so as to not cause a driver to swerve off of the road. Especially a Vet like me.
The contact owns a 2018 Honda Accord. The contact stated that when the vehicle was started, there were several unknown warning lights illuminated. The contact was unable to access several features in the vehicle during the failure. Additionally, the contact stated that while stopped at a traffic light, the vehicle would shake and vibrate abnormally. The spark plugs and rear sensors replaced by an independent mechanic however, the failure persisted. The local dealer was contact and informed of the failure however, the vehicle was not taken to be diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was unknown.
Vehicle occasionally displays large orange "BRAKE" warning on dash when there are no vehicles or obstructions ahead.  It then applies the brakes.  This happens both when Adaptive Cruise Control is engaged, and when it is not.
Approximately 4 days ago came out to my car (in the garage) to discover a large stress crack in my windshield starting at the very edge of the lower right portion into the drivers view. No rock damage was visible the windshield nor was there any kind of accident. Took it to my Honda dealership, and got a shrug in response. They wanted insurance to cover it. I was told that this problem is quite common with the 2018 2.0 T models, but nothing has been done.
So far I've had to replace 2 door lock actuators on my car since I purchased it brand new in 2018. Last year the first one to stop working was in the driver door. I figured this made sense because I am usually riding alone so this door gets more of a work out. But last month the passenger rear door lock stopped working as well. I purchased the extended warranty so both of the locks were fixed after a $100 deductible for each occurrence. This morning I notice my driver side rear door would not unlock. I figured I can't be the only person experiencing this issue.
U3006-13 CONTROL MODULE INPUT POWER “A” CIRCUIT OPEN   ISSUE # 19 PLEASE HAVE THE MANUFACTURER FIX THIS PROBLEM ASAP
All indicators that came on at the same time on the dashboard.  1. Brake system indicator  2. Vehicle stability(vsa)  3. Safety support system 4. ABS Anti-lock brake system 5. System message  6. Locks locking and unlocking while the car was in motion 7. Failure to disengage the electronic parking brake 8. Car wouldn’t start at all  While on the freeway locks started acting up locking and unlocking by themselves, got off the freeway and turn the car off to see if that would fix the issue. It didn’t fix the problem! Tried turning on the car and had a hard time starting the car than the parking brake didn’t disengage and all the warning lights listed above came on and the car had no power. Very dangerous I do not want to be statistic killed by my own car. If I take it to the dealer they will charge me a lot of money to diagnose and find nothing like always. I have no money to throw away like that.   I have a family and I don’t want to die due to my car malfunctioning on the freeway or street loosing power like it did.very concerned at this point!
I left my purse in the car and went in to pick up puppy. The car doors had self locked with my purse and keys inside the car. I  have reported  to the dealership and Honda of America. No response from HOA. I am concerned that someone might have a child or dog in the car and thinking that they are just going in house for a minute would come back to the car and find the doors locked. My phone was also in the car. It took 45 minutes for me to find someone, use their phone to make a call, and have someone bring the spare key. That is a long time for a child or animal to be locked in a car.
WINDSHIELD IS INCREDIBLY FRAGILE. HAS CRACKED AND GOTTEN CHIPPED UNDER MINIMAL DRIVING. THERE IS A PROHIBITIVELY HIGH COST TO REPLACE BECAUSE OF DRIVER ASSISTANCE CAMERA ATTACHED DIRECTLY TO WINDSHIELD.
I WAS BACKING THE VEHICLE SLOWLY IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE AND IT WAS ACCELERATE ALL OF SUDDEN. THERE WAS A CURB ON THE BACK, BUT IT WENT OVER AND HIT THE TREE. IT WAS OUT OF CONTROL
THE ADS BREAKING ERROR COMES ON AND THE CAR WON'T START- THIS IS THE 3RD TIME AND IS A CONSTANT PROBLEM FOR THIS YEAR- THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKS UP THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS. THIS HAS HAPPENED MOVING AND STATIONARY. HONDA SAYS IT IS A SIMPLE ERROR MY CAR HAS LESS THAT 30K MILES N THIS IS A CONSTANT ISSUE
THIS IS A COMPLAINT FOR A UNIQUE OCCURRENCE OF THIS PROBLEM ON THIS DATE.  IN SOME INSTANCES, IT SEEMS THAT THE VENTILATION SYSTEM IS POTENTIALLY PULLING NOXIOUS FUMES IN FROM THE ENGINE BAY AND IN OTHERS, THERE SEEMS TO BE AN ISSUE WITH MOISTURE RETENTION WHEN AC IS RUN.  THE VEHICLE SEEMS TO FORCE FOUL SMELLING AIR IN TO THE CAB.  HONDA HAS FAILED TO PROPERLY TROUBLESHOOT THE ISSUE (I.E. RETAIN THE VEHICLE FOR MORE THAN A FEW HOURS AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND IF THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE VENTILATION SYSTEM OR SOMETHING ELSE).
IN DECEMBER 2019, MY CAR AIR CONDITIONER WAS MAKING AN UNUSAL NOISE WHEN BEING TURNED ON. I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND THE TECHNICIAN THERE SAID THAT THE AIR CONDENSER WAS LEAKING. HE ADDED THAT IT WOULD BE A >$1000 CHARGE TO FIX THIS ISSUE. AT THAT TIME, BECAUSE THE WEATHER WAS NOT TOO HOT, THE AIR CONDITIONER WAS NOT A BIG ISSUE SO I DID NOT FIX IT THEN. HOWEVER, IN JUNE 2020, THE AIR CONDITIONER WAS BLOWING WARM AIR AND IT WAS A HOT SUMMER SO I HAD TO PAY >$1000 TO FIX IT BY THE DEALER. I SAW THE RECALL FOR HONDA CIVIC MODEL OF THE SAME YEAR BEING CLAIMED FOR THE SAME ISSUE SO I TALKED TO THE MANUFACTURER, BUT THEY WERE SAYING THAT THE RECALL DOES NOT APPLY TO HONDA ACCORD MODELS. HOWEVER, MY BROTHER, WHO HAS THE SAME MODEL OF THE SAME YEAR, HAD THE SAME ISSUE SO HE HAD TO FIX THE PROBLEM AS WELL. I ALSO HAVE SEEN SEVERAL SIMILAR CASES WITH THE AIR CONDITIONER OF THE SAME MODEL MANUFACTURED IN THE SAME YEAR. I BELIEVE, JUST LIKE THE CIVIC MODELS, A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION NEEDS TO BE PERFORMED ABOUT THIS ISSUE. IF YOU GOOGLE "HONDA ACCORD AIR CONDITIONER', IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO FIND THE ISSUE. I HOPE MY APPEAL PREVENTS ANY UNFORTUNATE, UNEXPECTED AND STILL UNFAIR COST TO THE VEHICLE OWNERS. THIS IS AN AIR CONDITIONING PROBLEM SO IN SUMMER THIS COULD BE A SAFETY ISSUE. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE THOROUGHLY. - OWNER OF 2018 HONDA ACCORD
COLLISION MITIGATION BRAKING SYSTEM' (CMBS'), FAILED. DURING DRIVING ALL OF SUDDEN AMBER LIGHTS OF COLLISION MITIGATION BRAKING SYSTEM' (CMBS'), WERE TURNED ON AND DISABLE THE ASSISTANCE SAFETY TECHNOLOGY FEATURES THAT HELP PREVENT COLLISIONS USING VEHICLE SENSORS.
THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE STEERING OF THE CAR WHICH SO FAR HAS ONLY PRESENTED ITSELF IN WINTER WHEN THE TEMPERATURES ARE LOWER.  IT WAS FIRST NOTICED IN NOVEMBER OF 2019 WHEN THE CAR HAD ROUGHLY 18,000 MILES.  THE VEHICLE WAS LEASED TO ME AS A NEW VEHICLE, AND I AM THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS SPENT APPRECIABLE TIME DRIVING THIS VEHICLE.    WHEN DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS OF 55+ MPH IN COLD WEATHER, IT REQUIRES HIGHER THAN NORMAL EFFORT TO MOVE THE STEERING WHEEL FROM ITS ON-CENTER POSITION (SUCH AS TO MAKE MINOR CORRECTIONS TO MAINTAIN LANE POSITION).    IF ENOUGH EFFORT IS EXERTED, THE STEERING WHEEL BREAKS FREE AND THEN ALLOWS THE CAR TO BE STEERED WITH NORMAL EFFORT UNTIL THE WHEEL AGAIN REMAINS ON-CENTER FOR A FEW SECONDS, AT WHICH POINT IT BECOMES "STICKY" AGAIN, REQUIRING HIGH EFFORT TO MOVE.    AT THIS POINT IT ONLY OCCURS AT THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, BUT MY CONCERN IS THIS COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE SHOULD THE EFFORT BECOME ANY HIGHER, REQUIRING SUCH FORCE TO MOVE THE WHEEL THAT THE RESULT WILL BE TO SWERVE OUT OF ONE'S LANE WHEN IT BREAKS FREE, OR EVEN LOCKING ON CENTER ALTOGETHER, MAKING THE CAR UNCONTROLLABLE BY THE DRIVER.    IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS A PURELY MECHANICAL ISSUE (E.G. AN ISSUE WITH THE STEERING RACK) BECAUSE TURNING THE IGNITION OFF RETURNS THE STEERING TO NORMAL EFFORT AND THE "STICKING" IS RESOLVED.    IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL NHTSA COMPLAINTS I HAVE FOUND IN INTERNET SEARCHES THAT DESCRIBE PRECISELY THE SAME ISSUE.    I HAVE REPORTED IT TODAY, 7/23/2020, TO THE DEALER FROM WHICH I PURCHASED THE CAR - TOM KADLEC HONDA IN ROCHESTER, MN - AS I WOULD LIKE TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE BEFORE COLD TEMPERATURES RETURN.
500 MILE TRIP ON THE INTERSTATE, STEERING IS AGAIN (THIRD TIME NOW)  FEELING STICKY OR LIKE IT GETS STUCK WHEN MAKING SMALL CORRECTIONS AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. STEERING RACK WAS REPLACED ONCE, SINCE THE PROBLEM FOR A FEW MONTHS BUT IT IS BACK AGAIN.
ON JANUARY 4TH WHILE TRAVELING HOME MY ACCORD WAS SET IN CRUISE CONTROL AND OUT OF THE BLUE HIT THE BRAKES ON IT'S OWN WITH NO ONE AROUND ME. I BRUSHED IT OFF BUT ABOUT 20 MILES OR SO DOWN THE ROAD IT DID IT AGAIN EXCEPT THUS TE WAS NEXT TO A DIESEL AND NOT ONLY DID BRAKE ON ITS ON IT ALSO RESPONDED AS IF I WAS OUT MY LANE AND BEGAN TO TO TURN MY CAR INTO THE DIESEL  I WAS ABLE TO KEEP THE CAR FROM CRASHING AND THE THE CRUISE CONTROL WENT OUT AND I BEGAN TO GET A MESSAGE THE THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE BRAKING MECHANISM. I WAS WORRIED ABOUT DRIVING THE REMAINDER OF OF MY TRIP BUT I WAS AN HOUR AND HALF AWAY FROM HOME SO TRAVELED ON HOME CHECK MY BRAKES CONSTANTLY. THIS EXPERIENCE HAS MY WIFE AND I RATTLED. I TOOK MY CAR IN ON THE 6TH TO TOPEKA HONDA  AND EXPLAINED WHAT HAPPENED AND THAT THE CAR TRIED TO KILL ME AND MY WIFE BY TRYING TO RUN US INTO A DIESEL TRUCK AND HOW IT WAS BRAKING ON ITS OWN AND THE TOOK AND LOOKED AT IT . THE DEALERSHIP CALLED ME BACK A STATED"THERE WAS SOME GUNK ON YOUR CENSOR AND THAT CAUSE THIS TO HAPPEN AND THEY CLEANED IT OFF IT WAS FINE" BUT IF THE CENSOR IS ON THE FRONT OFF THE CSR AND GUNK MAKES IT NOT WORK SURELY THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE NOR WILL I ALLOW MY WIFE TO OPERATE THIS VEHICLE.

I HAVE EXPERIENCED A NUMBER OF ISSUES WITH THE 2018 HONDA ACCORD SPORT, RELATED TO THE ENGINE, TRANSMISSION, HEAD UNIT, BRAKE HOLD SYSTEM, NOISE (TIRE AND POOR SOUND INSULATION) AS WELL OTHER ISSUES WHICH ARE DESCRIBED IN THE ATTACHED DOCUMENT.
ELECTRONIC BRAKING SYSTEM ERROR POPPED UP, WHICH SUGGESTED TAKING THE CAR TO A DEALERSHIP. THE CAR WAS PARKED FOR 2 DAYS AND THE ENGINE WOULD NOT START WITH THIS ERROR.
STEERING WHEEL STICKS WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  FIRST NOTICED ON A LONG TRIP FROM VIRGINIA TO NJ AND THOUGHT IT WAS A ONE-TIME THING.  HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM CONTINUED ON THE RETURN TRIP.  PROBLEM PRESENTS ITSELF INITIALLY AS THE STEERING WHEEL SEEMS "FROZEN" IN PLACE.  TO CORRECT THE NORMAL DRIFT, DRIVER MUST "BREAK" THE STEERING WHEEL FREE FROM THE FROZEN POSITION TO CORRECT THE DRIFT.  THIS IS A CONTINUAL CONDITION AS THE STEERING WHEEL RETURNS INSTANTLY TO ITS FROZEN STATE AND MUST BE CONTINUALLY UN-STUCK DURING THE DURATION OF THE TRIP - GOING FROM STUCK TO UN-STUCK BACK TO STUCK.  TRIP WAS MADE DURING COLD, RAINY, AND SOMETIMES LIGHTLY SNOWY CONDITIONS.  CAR IS CURRENTLY AT DEALERSHIP AND IS BEING DRIVEN HOME BY TECHNICIANS IN AN ATTEMPT TO INDUCE THE FAULT.  TURNED OFF ALL SYSTEMS SUSPECTED OF AFFECTING THIS CONDITION - ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL, HONDA SENSING, LAND DEPARTURE WARNING, ETC.  PROBLEM EXISTS WHETHER THESE FEATURES ARE ENGAGED OR NOT.  THE PRESENCE OF THIS CONDITION MAKE ME VERY UNEASY ABOUT DRIVING THIS CAR ON THE HIGHWAY AT 55+ MPH AS I DON'T KNOW IF THE STEERING WHEEL IS GOING TO JUST LOCK UP AND NOT BREAK FREE FROM ITS STUCK CONDITION.
COLLISION MITIGATION BRAKING SYSTEM PROBLEM WHILE ON CRUISE CONTROL IT WILL DISENGAGE AND THIS ERROR WILL SHOW UP ALSO BRAKING LIGHT FLASHES ON AND OFF WITH NOTHING AROUND OR NEAR THE SENSORS.
AS I WAS PULLING OUT THE GARAGE FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT HEADING TOWARDS THE HIGHWAY TO SAN FRANCISCO THE MILES PER HOUR IS 30 ENTERING AND THEN 65 MPH WHEN YOU GET ON HIGHWAY. THE DASH BOARD INDICATES THE WRONG MILES FOR SPEED IT SAID 100 MPH. IT STAYED LIKE THAT FOR MORE THAN 5 MINS. I ALREADY HAD A PREVIOUS SITUATION WITH THIS VEHICLE WHERE THE BRAKING SYSTEMS ENGAGED AS I WAS ON HIGHWAY IN 05/13/2018, AND ALMOST CAUSED MY LIFE AND OTHERS BEHIND ME, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE FROM BEING REAR ENDED AND OVER 18K WORTH OF DAMAGE BUT HONDA DEALER KEEP SAYING NOTHING WAS FOUND FAULTY! I HAD THEM TURN 'OFF' ALL SAFETY MODES CAUSE I'M AFRAID IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN BUT IT KEEPS COMING BACK 'ON'. IT YANKED ME SEVERAL TIMES WHEN NO OTHER CAR IS AROUND ME. THE BRAKING LIGHT APPEARED SEVERAL TIMES ALREADY SINCE I GOT IT BACK, AND IT'S LIKE THEY DON'T BELIEVE YOU. NOW AFTER ALL THIS I'M STUCK WITH A FAULTY CAR I'M REALLY THINKING ABOUT GETTING A LAWYER ON THIS. AND MY SPEAKERS SEEM NOT TO BE RIGHT EITHER THE SOUNDING IS VERY LOW COMPARED TO WHEN I GOT IT. ONLY 2000 MILES AND THIS CAR BEEN A PAIN . PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY! AND DID I MENTION THAT MY AIRBAGS DIDN'T WORK FROM FIRST INCIDENT I REPORTED. AFTER CAR WAS CRUSHED IN FROM BEING HIT FROM BEHIND . NOPE THEY FAILED TOO.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2018 HONDA ACCORD. WHILE AT A STOP LIGHT, THE VEHICLE STALLED AND THE TRANSMISSION AND BRAKE WARNING INDICATORS ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS RESTARTED AND WAS ABLE TO DRIVE NORMALLY. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO HONDA OF CONCORD (LOCATED AT 7650 BRUTON SMITH BLVD, CONCORD, NC 28027, (704) 774-4538) TO BE DIAGNOSED, BUT A FAILURE CODE COULD NOT BE FOUND. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 37,000.
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THIS CARS COLLISION MITIGATION SYSTEM HAS APPLIED THE BRAKES WITHOUT ANY REASON AND THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE FOR THE PUBLIC AT LARGE AND NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION FROM HONDA. I'VE SEEN SOME COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE 2017 AND 2018 CRV DOING THIS EXACT SAME THING.
SIMILAR TO NHTSB COMPLAINT ID# 11111897, VEHICLE LOST POWER WHILE IN MOTION ON 7/21/208 ON HIGHWAY IN CONGESTION WHILE RAINING.  IT HAS SINCE BEEN TOWED TO HONDA DEALERSHIP WHERE CURRENTLY UNDERGOING REPAIR WORK.  I WAS TOLD FUEL INJECTORS NEEDED REPLACEMENT UNDER WARRANTY.  I HOPE THIS SOLVES THE ISSUE AND DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN AS I WAS PUT IN A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT AFTERNOON.

See attached document for complaint
for the past 3-4 months it started off with shaking. once i would try to accelerate it it would choke. took it to the dealer ship and they had it for almost 2 months. Supposedly the engiens head gasket tend to blow for those type of cars model and year. i was called yesterday that it was ready after almost 2 months. not 3 hours went by and the issue started to happened again. i have my kids if a accident would of happened my kids would of been injured. if it has happened to many honda accords 2019 1.5 sport why not do a recall on it. it could cause my life my kids or someone else in the road.

Unlnown.  I need a recall service done on my vehicle , I have not been able to receive this service and my vehicle has hesitation during driving when I want to accelerate entering highways.
When I am driving on the highway, sometimes my car just brakes.  This has happened 7 times!  I am lucky I am not dead, or I have not killed anyone yet.  It will go from 60 mph down to 20 mph all of a sudden.  I am scared to drive my own car.

1.the AC is not working no more I told the people at the Honda dealer that it will hiss and my car will vibrate in the seats and this been going on for 2 years and I had Honda care and the people at the dealership  told me it’s not nun to worry saying it’s common for Honda now I don’t have AC at all
The fuel injectors failed at around 150,000 miles.  The entire dash will light up with warnings and the car will loose power.  I had it checked with the dealer and all of my maintenance's have been done at the dealer.  My advisor said that it was due to the fuel injectors and that I would need to replace all of the injectors and the injector rack.  That would cost approximately $1,500, but that I could still drive the car like that because my car is in great condition and I always take care of it.  He said drive it, "But just don't punch it (accelerate) to much".  My advisor knows that I commute to work, I drive about 150 miles per day and that was the advise that he gave me.  At 167,000 miles, as I was driving to work, my car started to pull on me, as if it was chocking, I released the gas and continued, but I noticed that the car wasn't accelerating anymore.  I pulled over to the shoulder on the freeway and turned off the car, I restarted the car to see if it would continue and it moved for about a mile and then it started pulling again.  I called my employer to let them know that I was having car trouble and that I will not make it to work.  I returned home and went straight to the dealership.  I met with my advisor and he said, "We'll take a look an I'll get back to you by the end of the day."  By the end of the day my advisor informed me that I had a blown head gasket and needed fuel injector replacements and that it would cost me around $5,000 to fix it.   My question was, "Did this occur because I didn't repair the fuel injectors when you told me?" He said, "No."  My thing is, if I have always took my car to the dealership for all maintenance work, how come they didn't know that my car was leaking or taking in liquid to the engine.   I've spoken to other Honda owners with 2018 thru 2020 Honda Accord Sport 1.5 an 2.0 and at least 15 of them have told me that they've had fuel injector problems with their cars and 5 of them had blown head gaskets.  Recall needed
I have a fuel pump defect and waiting for the part for months now and my car is running bad. Speed this process up or your going to have a class action lawsuit ahead.
The contact owns a 2019 Honda Accord. The contact stated that on three separate occasions, a bubble had formed on three different tires which resulted in the tires being replaced. On each occasion, an abnormal, thud-like sound was coming from the vehicle. Once the vehicle was taken for an inspection, the contact was notified that a bubble had formed on the tire. The contact stated that the failure had occurred twice with the rear passenger’s side tire, and once on the front driver’s side tire, each with a different tire brand. On the last occasion, the contact stated that while driving at 75 MPH, the tire pressure warning light illuminated on the instrument panel with a burning rubber odor coming from the vehicle. The dealer and the manufacturer were notified of the failure. The vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 38,000.
The car braked on its own without any obstruction or person in front of car, which almost caused me to get rear ended.
I have had several times where the "BRAKE" alert comes on the dash and the car brakes and will not excel.  Note.. this happens when there is absolutely NOTHING in front of me.  This is apparently a common issue as I am seeing that many people have reported this.   I have reached out to my dealer with this however, because it does it when it wants to and not all the time, they have not been able to see it happen or know why.
Vibration Noise / Shuddering – Experienced a pronounced Low-frequency vibration noise / shuddering while coasting down in speed with foot off gas pedal.  Felt like the CVT didn’t want to down-shift as speed decreased.  Problem first occurred several times on August 12-13, 2021 when odometer was ~ 15,250, and has happened a few times since.
The seatbelt and airbag collision sensor stopped working.  The air pressure monitoring system sensor stopped working.  The brake sensor suddenly goes off when no vehicle or person is in the way.
The contact owns a 2019 Honda Accord. The contact stated that while driving approximately 50-60 MPH, the automatic braking system was applied temporarily. An unknown warning light appeared and the vehicle started making a beeping sound. The contact stated that the failure reoccurred twice while a truck was passing the vehicle on the driver’s side at night. The dealer was notified of the failure and advised the contact to bring the vehicle to their location for diagnostic testing. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 15,000.
On 11/30/21, I was driving approximatley at 25 mph when my car suddenly came to a complete stop for no apparent reason. My foot was on the accelerator, an orange warning on the dash flashed and my head and neck snapped. This is the third incident this year. Other incidents were 11/18/21 and 2/6/21. Both were reported to NHTSA. Complaint number for 11/18/21 is 11442365. The Complaint number for 2/6/21 is 11395658.  I do plan to take the car to the dealer again for  diagnostic tests even though the tests performed on 2/10/21 showed "no system failure was detected at this moment". I fully expect to be told the same thing regarding this incident.

HAVE TAKEN MY BRAND NEW 2019 HONDA ACCORD SPORT 1.5 TO TWO DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS DUE TO MY CAR NOT TRACKING STRAIGHT. EACH TIME A MINOR TWEAK WAS DONE TO THE ALIGNMENT. AFTER RESEARCHING A BIT MORE I FOUND THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE GEAR BOX BEING FAULTY (53620-TWA-A28) WHICH CAUSES THE TRACKING TO BE OFF WITH AND WITHOUT LANE KEEP ASSIST ENGAGED. I AM TRYING TO GET THIS ISSUE RECTIFIED AND AWAITING DEALER FEEDBACK. I HAVE CONTACTED THE DEALER AND MADE THEM AWARE OF THE ISSUE.  THE 2018 AND 2019 ACCORDS ARE VERY SIMILAR AND THE ISSUE IS PRESENT IN 2018S AND A FEW 2019S AFTER READING ACCOUNTS ON 'ACCORDXCLUB.COM'. MY BUILD MONTH AND YEAR WAS NOVEMBER 2018.
When driving my car it will phantom break when there is nothing in front of it going down the highway 5060 miles an hour and it’s done at numerous times. I have not been in an accident yet, but it’s something that keeps occurring on my car.
Seat weight sensor failure resuling in the illumination of the SRS warning indicator
What component or system failed or malfunctioned, and is it available for inspection upon request? THE SRS LIGHT IS GOING OFF AND READING "SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM PROBLEM. SEE YOUR DEALER".  How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk? THE AIRBAGS ON MY PASSENGER SEAT  Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? YES, THERE IS A RECALL ON THE EXACT ISSUE, BUT THEY ARE TELLING ME THAT MY VEHICLE IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.  Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others? IT WAS INSPECTED BY HONDA OF LINCOLN.  Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear? YES.  JANUARY 28, 2025, I GOT IN MY CAR AND THE SRS LIGHT WAS GOING OFF. I TOOK MY CAR IN TO BE SEEN BY HONDA OF LINCOLN, AND THEY ARE REPORTING THE SRS DEVICE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. THOUGH THERE IS A OPEN RECALL. I AM BEING TOLD MY VEHICLE IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.
The contact owns a 2020 Honda Accord. The contact stated while driving approximately 50 MPH, the air bag warning light illuminated, and disappeared and reappeared approximately three weeks later. The vehicle was taken to a dealer where it was diagnosed and determined that the air bag needed to be replaced. The vehicle was repaired. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was 54,000.
I was driving on a road that the car has been on hundreds of times. Flat, straight, dry road with no other cars around. The car all of a sudden braked very hard and the "BRAKE" light started flashing and beeping for about 3-4 seconds and then went off and then the brake fully released. It was like hitting an invisible wall and fighting to maintain control of the car at the same time. It came out of nowhere and was so shocking. There was nothing around me and no reason for the AEB system to be used. I can't tell you if my foot was pressing on the gas or had lifted to maintain speed. I do know that my foot was on or lifted above the gas pedal and nowhere near the brake. I am shocked it didn't cause an accident but I am guessing that is because I held tight to the steering wheel and possibly because there were no other cars around. I have severe whiplash, a major headache, backache and am very scared driving the car should it happen again. I have not gone to receive medical treatment yet but it is highly likely that I will need it. I will be contacting the dealership as well to discuss.
The ANC module malfunctions already at only 67000 miles and causes a humming noise which is very annoying when driving. The ebreak also malfunctions during cold weather conditions. I have had to restart the car due to the electronic parking break not working properly. In case of an emergency I might need it and it may malfunction.
The contact owns a 2020 Honda Accord. The contact stated that on several occasions while driving at various speeds, the Forward Collision Mitigation Braking System notification message displayed, and the brake pedal was depressed but the pedal remained on the floorboard. The contact stated that the vehicle decelerated from 65 MPH to 15 MPH before abruptly stopping. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 55,000.
The contact owns a 2020 Honda Accord. The contact stated while driving 40 MPH, the vehicle inadvertently decelerated without warning. The contact stated that after several minutes the vehicle started to operate as needed. On another occasion, while driving 35 MPH, the brake assist activated independently causing the vehicle to brake suddenly. On another occasion, while attempting to start the vehicle, the vehicle failed to start-up after several attempts. The contact stated that several unknown warning lights were illuminated. The vehicle was towed to the dealer for diagnostic testing. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was not contacted. The failure mileage was 62,000.
I was driving at a slow speed (10-15mph) when my brakes automatically engaged. After the car stopped I began to accelerate and the brakes engaged again. There wasn’t any reason for the brakes to engage.
Just before March 2, 2021 shortly after purchasing this new vehicle I discovered a safety hazard in which the passenger window will not roll down, I brought it to Hoehn Honda in Carlsbad on March 2 and they oiled the window to make it work.   I had concerns that they did not replace the motor mechanisms and it would fail again which it has.  Today May 17 2021 I was not feeling ill at work and went to sit in my car to roll down the windows to get a breeze and again the passenger front seat window is stuck.  One or two times it seemed like it didn’t work but on the next try it did after the repair.   now it’s frozen again.     Having non-operational windows is a safety hazard and a passenger hazard, and a law enforcement hazard if pulled over and the window will not roll down.  It is stuck in the up position.  The dealership has no interest it’s a safety hazard and requires i drive it in and will not provide me a loaner car.
CONSTANT ALERT COMING ON VEHICLE AS DRIVING SAYING "COLLISION MITIGATION BRAKING SYSTEM HAS A PROBLEM. HAVE YOUR VECHILE CHECKED BY DEALER" ALONG WITH "ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROM SYSTEM HAS PROBLEM. TURN OFF ENGINE, THEN RESTART" AM I DEALING WITH A COMPUTER OR A VEHICLE I CAN POTENTIALLY LOSE MY LIFE IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG???
THE CAR WAS IN MOTION ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND IT STOPPED ACCELERATING.  I PULLED OVER AND COULD NOT GET THE CAR TO ACCELERATE MORE THAN A COUPLE MPH.
Infotainment system is glitching, I have had my car for 1 year and it is a distraction and frustrating when the infotainment system changes on its own. It shows touches to the screen when I have not touched the screen. Changes pages, mutes calls, closes maps, changes songs, etc. I have seen many blogs about it being a persistant problem for many people. When I take it to the dealership they will do nothing about it except disconnect the battery, which is not a solution. I do not like paying for a car that I am not able to use fully. Actions need to be taken to correct this issue for me and many other owners.
Lanes on the roadway were adjusted for a workzone. Because of these lane adjustments, a large amount of crack sealer was used on the roadway. The car confused the crack sealer as roadway markings and tried to slam on the brakes in a workzone, thinking I was going over the lines, unless I used the turn signal to override the automatic braking, which is the only way I was able to avoid getting rear-ended. This ian't the first time this ecent has occurred in my vehicle.
Honda continues to refuse to make recall repairs.  Currently telling me that there is a 4-5 wait for repairs because Honda refuses to supply them.  Dealers are telling me that Honda will only send them 10 per week and won't send more until the defective ones are returned to Honda.  According to my dealer there are 2,000 other customers in line before me for my repairs.   Honda also has a defective HondaLink app that work with car to communicate needed repairs and service.  Honda says my car needs a software update, dealer says there is no update, no TSB, and no recall.   Why is Honda allowed to drag their feet for years with recalls?  20 dead from the Takata recall alone.   Shameful lack of oversite!
My honda Accord’s automatic braking system suddenly engaged this morning for no reason. The driver of the car following me had to slam on his breaks to avoid rear-ending me. If the other driver had not stopped, we would both have been injured. Honda’s emergency braking system is dangerous. There should be a way to disable it permanently.

Car moving slowly and suddenly races and speeds UP.  Hard to STOP it.  Has happened twice, 8 to 10 Months apart..  First time was on a small driveway.  Was able to STOP CAR , with no damages.  2nd occurrence i was pulling into a parking Space.  Foot not on gas or brake and again the CAR accelerated.  This Time the CAR hit a handicapped parking sign and pushed it over.  The sign stopped the CAR with Assistance from me.  There was a small drop in front of the CAR and a tree 10-15 Feet in front of the Hill. The passenger in my CAR would have been in severe trouble had I not gotten the CAR stopped.  My husband thought i may have somehow activated the cruise control.  But i was going less than 20 miles per hour each time.  This could be a deadly problem if a Child or Someone Crossed in front of me.
Automatic braking has initiated for no reason, at least four times almost causing accidents, car radio sometimes will no shut off, seems to be some type of electrical problem, I have had both issues looked at by dealer who states they cannot find a problem with this vehicle, there is Definitely a problem and it must be found before someone get hurt.  auto braking has happened on the freeway, and on residential streets
My touch screen glitches to the point where it changes stations, changes my navigation and it doesn’t fix itself at all even when I touch the screen. It’s a driving hazard especially when you are using the navigation. It just started and has been happening every time I’m driving, regardless if my phone is attached via Bluetooth or usb or not even at all now it just glitches.
My car won’t crank. my touch screen is glitching. my idol system doesn’t work nor does my parking brake system.
The contact owns a 2022 Honda Accord. The contact stated that while driving approximately 40 MPH on a two-lane road, a truck going in the opposite direction passed the vehicle, and the Forward Collision Avoidance system erroneously engaged and applied the brakes and abruptly stopped the vehicle. The contact stated no warning light was illuminated. The contact stated that the failure had occurred once. The contact had not taken the vehicle to a local dealer or independent mechanic to be diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was not informed of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 5,000.
My car has been phantom braking very hard  on its own many times this past week while I was driving on the freeway. There’s no car in front of me and luckily no car was in back of me. Also I noticed it happens a lot when I change lane. I noted these frequent frightful occurrences below. It just brakes when nothing is in front.  6/14/24 @11:30am on the freeway 6/19/24 @9:17am on the freeway 6/22 /24 @8:37am phantom brake very hard  on the freeway
This occurred twice both happened on the highway going 65 mph. I accelerated as usual, suddenly the check engine light began blinking and I lost the ability to accelerate (limp mode). The car instantly dropped to 20 mph. After a minute, the check engine blinking light went away.  Both times I was luckily able to get off of the highway going 20 mph. The first occurrence, I turned the car off for 30 minutes. After turning back on, car was fine as if nothing happened. The second occurrence, after calling Honda they recommended towing to dealership, which I did.  At my dealership, they drove a lot, but could not duplicate issue. However, there was code DTC P0304 misfire. From the dealer paperwork "cylinder 4 swap spark plugs to known working plug misfire gone recommend replacing all plug random misfire. Removed and replaced all spark plugs."  Since this repair two weeks ago, I have not had any issues and the acceleration feels less sluggish than before.   This is a VERY serious issue that could result in injury or death if it occurs to others!
Experienced very hard and rapid braking from the Collision Mitigation Braking System when no obstruction or collision was imminent. The dashboard indicated "BRAKING" at the time of the event, but there was otherwise no other warning or indication before the event happened. Issue has happened several times. Sometimes when drifting over a dashed line when merging onto a highway, but also happened this week when driving in a straight line while it was raining. All hard braking was when vehicle was over 50 MPH and on a highway.
The contact owns a 2011 Ford Escape. The contact stated while driving 10-15 MPH the power steering function became inoperable. The contact pulled over and turned off and restarted the vehicle several times to regain power steering functionality. There were no warning lights illuminated. The contact stated that the failure was related to NHTSA Campaign Number: 14V284000 (Steering). The contact called the local dealer, but the vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic who determined that the power steering assist sensor had failed and needed to be replaced. The manufacturer was contacted and confirmed there was no recall coverage on the VIN for the failure. The manufacturer referred the contact to the NHTSA Hotline for assistance. The failure mileage was approximately 195,000.
There was a recall (#14S05 from Ford) that covered Electric Power Steering Failure in Escapes and Mariners from 2008 - September of 2011 made in the Kansas City Assembly plant. This vehicle mentioned is having the same issue, but is not included on the recall list? We diagnosed the problem with a Snap-On computer here at M&D Auto & Trailer Sales & Service, LLC. The customer complained that the steering wheel and column would shake and then feel like there was no power steering making it almost impossible to drive. No inspection other than at M&D Auto. No lights came on but our Snap-On scanner produced DTC B2278 and told us about the afore mentioned recall.
The electric steering is not letting you turn the steering wheel while driving you have to turn the car off and let it sit before it will work again. I see there is a recall for the same year as my car but it is not included? I don’t understand why as I see that there are others with the same issues.
This 2011 Ford Escape has a front K-frame (subframe) failure. The area where the front passenger lower control connects to the k-frame has completely rusted through, causing the lower control arm to almost detach from the vehicle at the front bushing.   While driving, the steering wheel suddenly became crooked and the car was taken to a shop for an alignment. Upon inspection it was learned that the K-frame has rusted in that one area so badly that the wheel could become detached if the vehicle is driven any further.   I see that Ford has this exact issue with 2001-2004 models and did a recall. However, they are not indicating that they are addressing this same problem with newer models.
Front sub frame rusting through that could potentially result in the control arms breaking away from the sub frame and the driver losing control of the vehicle. No incident has occurred from this, but could if not inspected and found. This was found by an independent service center. No warning lamps
Power steering fails intermittently with no warning. Causes loss of steering control momentarily, then returns to normal after restarting. It has affected this vehicle sporatically since 152K miles. Odometer reads 156K on 7-10-23. It has not been inspected by any mechanic, dealer, or insurance professional. This is a serious safety risk.
electric power steering failed without warning while driving.
subframe is rotted and its so common why does ford not doing anything on this
got rear ended/t-boned in january 2022 at low rate of speed, started having issues for the first time since 2011, check engine light comes on periodically since the accident, power steering has gone in and out periodically since the accident, engine seems to stumble periodically since March 2022, AC has never worked since 2011, recently (june 3rd 2022) the tire pressure sensor light has come on despite air pressure being adequate in all 4 tires, took car to a collision specialist and they repaired cosmetic damages but cleared 3 codes and did not repair/resolve any of the actual issues affecting drivability and safety because they could not attribute it to the mechanism of accident, took the print out of codes in to my normal mechanic when I got the tires and oil changed June 3rd 2022 and he said if there were no active codes I would have to take it to the dealership, yesterday June 24th 2022 while waiting for a light to change the car pedals suddenly stopped working, car stayed idling at a stop while still in drive, would not work even when shifted into park, drive, or reverse, air still blowed, music still playing, a horrid smell started to fill the car, turned everything completely off and turned hazards on and waited for 2 minutes then turned the car back, car resumed working with tire pressure light still on and smell still coming out of engine. Car now smells constantly of putrid burning plastic/carpet and stumbles frequently, had the car stumbled while at a high rate of speed during rush hour, both mine, my infant son, and the other drivers lives' could've been devastated or lost. These are the codes they reset at time of incident/repair 1) ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM: C1963-20 - STABILITY CONTROL INHIBIT WARNING  2) ACCESORY PROTOCOL INTERFACE MODULE: U3000-04 -CONTROL MODULE - SYSTEM INTERNAL FAILURES  3) POWER STEERING CONTROL MODULE: B2278-2F - STEERING SHAFT TORQUE SENSOR MALFUNCTION
The power steering in my 2011 Ford Escape is producing a grinding noise along with vibrations strong enough to make the steering wheel rock back and forth while in park. In driving the vehicle you have to actually fight the wheel to maintain your position in the lane. The car will be inspected by a certified service center by Thursday, 1/19 if not sooner. I will be able to provide more information once it is inspected. In having to fight with the steering you had to be aware of cars and objects nearby as it had a tendency to jerk the wheel off course. The car did not display and warning messages or symptoms prior to this current event.
When I entered elementary street in Lousville CO, to pick up my three grandchildren, the steering got so hard that I couldn't maneuver between so many cars, I couldn't turn, I was very scared if children started to come out, I got to the parking and parking badly, I called for help, to pick up children, and a man said turn it on again, it will work, my brother took the car to my house, and according to him it worked, I was so scared, that I will not drive it anymore, until I fix it , mechanic said the electric power steering should be changed, in the Ford, they gave a budget for a spare part, I am inquiring about "Recalls" and it says my car has zero, but there is one on # 14S05 and I want to know why this does not apply to me car, can you please help me?

POWER STEERING FAILURES RELATED TO ELECTRICAL POWER STEERING COLUMN. IT CUTS OUT INTERMITTENTLY AND HAS FAILED WHILE DRIVING. RESTARTING THE CAR SOMETIMES FIXES ISSUE. FORD HAS STATED OTHER 2011 FORD ESCAPES HAVE A RECALL FOR THE POWER STEERING SYSTEM- THIS VEHICLE IS NOT RECALLED.
THIS VEHICLE HAD A RECALL REGARDING THE FUEL DELIVERY MODULE REPAIRED IN MAY 2019 (BY CHAPMAN FORD IN HORSHAM, PA), JUST BEFORE I BOUGHT THE CAR IN JUNE. IN LATE AUGUST 2019, THE CAR WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY STARTING.  I BROUGHT IT TO MY LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP (FULLERTON FORD IN SOMERVILLE, NJ).  THEY INSISTED CHAPMAN FORD DID A POOR JOB WITH THE RECALL REPAIR (SPECIFICALLY CONNECTING THE FUEL PUMP) AND FORD CORPORATE AUTHORIZED FULLERTON TO FIX CHAPMAN'S POOR WORK (FREE OF CHARGE FOR ME). A FEW DAYS AGO, THE VEHICLE FAILED TO START EVEN WHEN JUMP STARTED.  THE LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIPS (MALOUF FORD IN NORTH BRUNSWICK, NJ AND FULLERTON FORD) SAID THEY DIDN'T HAVE AN OPENING TO WORK ON THE CAR FOR 3 WEEKS.  I WANTED TO TAKE THIS VEHICLE TO A FORD DEALERSHIP BUT I CAN'T AFFORD TO BE OUT OF A VEHICLE FOR 3 WEEKS SO I TOOK THE CAR TO A PRIVATE SHOP (QUALITY AUTO CENTER IN FRANKLIN PARK, NJ) .  THE PRIVATE SHOP DIAGNOSTICALLY PROVED THE FUEL PUMP NO LONGER WORKS. THE PRIVATE SHOP REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP AND THE VEHICLE NOW WORKS AGAIN.    THIS IS INDEED AN OLDER VEHICLE, BUT I THINK THE TIMING IS ESPECIALLY SUSPICIOUS THAT THE FUEL PUMP FAILS SHORTLY AFTER IT HAS BEEN HANDLED MULTIPLE TIMES FOR RECALL REPAIR.  FURTHERMORE, CHAPMAN FORD WAS DEEMED BY FORD CORPORATE TO DO A SUBPAR RECALL REPAIR.    I CALLED FULLERTON FORD AND FORD CORPORATE ABOUT POTENTIAL LIABILITY BUT THEY DIDN'T SEEM INTERESTED TO ENTERTAIN BECAUSE I WASN'T ABLE TO BRING MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR INSPECTION.

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 FORD ESCAPE. THE CONTACT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 16V777000 (FUEL SYSTEM, GASOLINE); HOWEVER, THE PART TO DO THE REPAIR WAS UNAVAILABLE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE MANUFACTURER EXCEEDED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THE RECALL REPAIR. THE CONTACT CALLED MULLINEX FORD OF KISSIMMEE (1810 IRLO BRONSON MEMORIAL HWY, KISSIMMEE, FL 34744) AND WAS INFORMED THAT THE PART WAS NOT AVAILABLE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE ISSUE. THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE. THE VIN WAS NOT AVAILABLE. *TT  *TR
LOST STEERING WHILE VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION ON A CITY STREET.  POWER HAS CUT OUT ON MANY OCCASIONS
I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY CRUISING AT 80MPH WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE GAS PEDAL STOPPED WORKING. THE CAR WAS STILL RUNNING BUT EVEN WHEN I WOULD PUT THE GAS PEDAL TO THE FLOOR IT WOULD NOT GIVE IT ANY ACCELERATION. A SMALL WRENCH SIGN POPPED UP ON THE DASH AND I PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE L. WHEN THE CAR WAS IN IDLE THE ENGINE WAS VERY SHAKY AND RPMS WERE GOING UP AND DOWN SO I SHUT THE ENGINE OFF. I SAT FOR ROUGHLY 5MINUTES AND THEN TRIED TO RESTART THE VEHICLE IT STARTED NO ISSUES. PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE AND THE GAS PEDAL WAS WORKING AGAIN NO ISSUES SO CONTINUED TO DINNER. ON THE WAY HOME TOOK 95 BUT WAS GOING 55-65 TAKING CAUTION IN CASE THE CAR STOPS WORKING AGAIN. TO NO SURPRISE IT DID SO I PULLED OVER SAT FOR 2 MINUTES AND RESTARTED WITH NO ISSUES AND FINISHED DRIVING HOME.
MY ESCAPE HAS FORD RECALL #16S41 ON IT.  I BEGAN TO SMELL A STRONG GASOLINE SMELL AROUND MY CAR.  I TOOK IT INTO MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIRS AND IT WAS DIAGNOSED WITH THE RECALL ISSUE.  EVEN THOUGH THIS RECALL HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE NOV/DEC OF 2016 THERE IS STILL NO PART TO REPAIR IT 8 MONTHS LATER.  THE DEALERSHIP SAID THEY WERE GOING TO REPLACE IT WITH A PART THAT HAS THE SAME DEFECT/RECALL.  I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THIS. THERE IS AN INCREASED RISK OF FIRE DUE TO FUEL LEAK.  THIS TIME I COULD SMELL GAS.  WILL I NEXT TIME?  WHAT IF THE CAR HAD BEEN PARKED IN THE GARAGE WHERE FUMES COULD BUILD UP AND SOMETHING SPARKED AND OUR WHOLE HOUSE EXPLODED.  I CANNOT CONTINUE TO PUT MYSELF, MY CHILDREN AND FRIENDS AND FAMILY (INCLUDING OTHER CHILDREN) IN MY CAR WHEN I DO NOT FEEL THAT IT IS SAFE AND FORD CANNOT CERTIFY THAT IT IS SAFE.  THEY DO NOT HAVE A DATE FOR WHEN THE REPLACEMENT PART WILL BE AVAILABLE AND THEY REFUSE TO GIVE ME A RENTAL OR LOANER VEHICLE.  THEY ARE REPORTING THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO INJURIES OR FATALITIES TO DATE DUE TO THIS RECALL.  ARE THEY WAITING FOR THAT TO HAPPEN BEFORE THEY PROTECT CONSUMERS?  ARE THERE NOT LIMITS TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY HAVE TO REMEDY AND DANGEROUS SAFETY RECALL?  I ALSO FIND IT INTERESTING THAT THIS RECALL WENT INTO EFFECT IN DECEMBER OF 2016 WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH THE EXACT TIME THAT ALL OF THOSE VEHICLES 5 YEAR WARRANTIES WOULD BE EXPIRED.  COINCIDENCE?
THE THROTTLE BODY OF MY FORD ESCAPE 2011 SEEMS TO BE MALFUNCTIONING, SINCE IT HAS A DRIVE BY WIRE SYSTEM, I WANT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE DEFECTS FORD CARS HAVE BEEN HAVING SURROUNDING ITS THROTTLE FUNCTIONALITY. WHENEVER I AM ACCELERATING FROM A STOP LIGHT OR ON THE HIGHWAY, THE CAR JUMPS FORWARD AND STARTS TO SHAKE, AND THEN SIMPLY DOES NOT ACCELERATE. IT HAPPENS SPORADICALLY, AND AFTER AN INSPECTION FROM A MECHANIC, IT'S SHOWING THAT THE THROTTLE BODY IS MALFUNCTIONING, AND THE CODES SHOWING THAT IT IS SIMULTANEOUSLY OPEN AND CLOSED. IT IS AN ISSUE THAT FORD VEHICLES UP TO 2012 SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN GETTING. I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS ISSUE SINCE 50,000 MILES ON THE CAR OF 2 YEARS AGO, AND IT'S BEEN HAPPENING SPORADICALLY, MAYBE ONCE A MONTH, OR ONCE EVERY 10 MINUTES.
WHEN DRIVING IN A LOW SPEED IN A CITY STREET, ALL OF A SUDDEN THE STEERING WHEEL WON'T STEER IT FELT SO HARD THAT I HAD TO STOP ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD TO PREVENT TO GET INTO ACCIDENT. I CHECKED ONLINE IF THERE'S ISSUE OR RECALL ON THIS VEHICLE. THERE'S A RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE BUT WHEN THEY TYPE THE VIN # IT'S NOT INCLUDED AND DEALERSHIP SAID IT WILL COST $2,000 TO FIX IT.NOT SURE WHY THIS IS NOT INCLUDED FOR RECALL...
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 FORD ESCAPE. WITHOUT WARNING, THE EPS FAILED AND THE STEERING WHEEL BECAME EXTREMELY TIGHT. THE CONTACT HAD TO CAUTIOUSLY PARK THE VEHICLE DUE TO THE FAILURE. THE DEALER WAS NOTIFIED. THE MANUFACTURER STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS EXCLUDED FROM NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 14V284000  (STEERING). THE CONTACT WAS UNCERTAIN OF WHEN THE VEHICLE WOULD BE DIAGNOSED AND REPAIRED. IN ADDITION, THE CONTACT WAS INCLUDED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 16V777000 (FUEL SYSTEM, GASOLINE). THE INTERIM NOTICE INDICATED THAT PARTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 106,000. VIN TOOL CONFIRMS PARTS NOT AVAILABLE.
WHILE DRIVING MY CAR I SLOWED DOWN TO MAKE A TURN AND THE ENGINE SUDDENLY STOPPED.NO WARNING, SHAKING OR DECREASE IN SPEED. IT JUST STOPPED I TRIED RESTARTING BUT IT WOULDNT START UNTIL 10MINS LATER. I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP WITH NO PROBLEMS OR  LIGHTS ON THE DASH  BUT AFTER I LEFT (THEY COULDN'T SEE THE CAR UNTIL 4 DAYS LATER) LEAVING THE LOT THE ENGINE SEEMED TO STALL  OFF AND ON FOR THE 5 MILE TRIP SO I WOULD PUT IT IN NEUTRAL  WHEN I WOULD COME TO A LIGHT AND COAST TO A STOP, THEN RESTART.  THE WRENCH LIGHT CAME ON AND LATER THE ENGINE LIGHT.  ALSO THE RPM 'S ON THE DASH WOULD GO UP TO 4-5 BUT MY ENGINE SPEED WOULD BE 40 MPH THIS SCARED ME SO BAD, I PARKED THE CAR UNTIL THE APPOINTMENT AT THE DEARLERSHIP WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP THEY DID A DIAGNOSTIC BUT KNOW CODES CAME UP. THEY DID FIX THE THROTTLE
THE POWER STEERING RANDOMLY GOES OUT. SOMETIMES IMMEDIATELY UPON TURNING THE VEHICLE ON, OTHER TIMES WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGH WAY, SOMETIMES WHILE DRIVING SLOW, OR TURNING. IT IS COMPLETELY RANDOM. THE QUICK/TEMPORARY FIX IS TO TURN THE VEHICLE BACK OFF AND ON AGAIN AND IT GOES AWAY FOR A WHILE. I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN TO FORD AND THEY HAVE TO REPLACE THE STEERING COLUMN WHICH COMES TO A TOTAL OF AROUND $1500. THIS IS THE SAME PROBLEMS OTHER VEHICLES HAD THAT WERE A PART OF THE RECALL. MY YEAR IS INCLUDED IN THE RECALL BUT FOR SOME REASON MY VIN IS NOT.
WHILE MERGING ONTO THE INTERSTATE THE THE CAR SUDDENLY BEGAN TO ACCELERATE AT FULL THROTTLE. TEMP ~30 DEG, ROAD - DRY PAVEMENT  ODOMETER:  110367.0 MILES. THE THROTTLE BODY WAS REPLACED IN SEPTEMBER 2015 BY THE FORD DEALER, AS WELL AS A NEW EXHAUST SYSTEM AT THE SAME TIME. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON THE DAY BEFORE.    INCIDENT:  I DO NOT KNOW MY ACTUAL SPEED AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT BECAUSE I WAS MERGING ON TO THE INTERSTATE. IT WAS A LONG RAMP, I AM PRETTY SURE I WAS GOING AT LEAST 45MPH.  I WAS ACCELERATING TO MERGE ON. ALL OF A SUDDEN THE ENGINE STARTED TO RACE AND THE CAR PROCEEDED TO ACCELERATE EVEN FASTER. I IMMEDIATELY PUSHED ON MY BRAKES WHICH HELPED TO KEEP ME FROM HITTING THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME. THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO RACE AS I WAS DEPRESSING THE BRAKE. I SHUT THE ENGINE OFF AND STEERED MY WAY TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. I PUT THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL AND ONCE I STOPPED I PUT THE CAR INTO PARK. I PROCEEDED TO TRY TO START THE CAR, BUT THE ENGINE RACED LIKE IT WAS AT FULL THROTTLE. I IMMEDIATELY SHUT IT OFF. I TRIED TWO MORE TIMES WITH THE SAME RESULT.    I CALLED MY HUSBAND'S MECHANIC WHOSE BUSINESS WAS CLOSE BY TO ASK HIS OPINION ABOUT WHAT TO DO NEXT. WITH HIM LISTENING ON THE PHONE, I STARTED THE ENGINE, BUT THIS TIME IS STARTED UP CORRECTLY. MAYBE A TOTAL OF 10 MINUTES HAD PASSED FROM THE FIRST INSTANCE OF ME HAVING TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THIS LAST TRY WHEN IT STARTED CORRECTLY. I DROVE THE CAR TO THE MECHANIC'S BUSINESS ABOUT 5 MILES AWAY. I WANTED HIM TO CHECK THE CODE FOR WHY THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON AND IF THAT WAS A FACTOR FOR THE THROTTLE ISSUE. THE CODE FOR THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT READ:  CODE#:   P0456  -  (EVAP) SYSTEM LEAK DETECTED  ( VERY SMALL LEAK).  WE ALSO CHECKED THE FLOOR MATS, BUT THERE WAS NO ISSUE WITH THEM. [THE MATS DID COME WITH THE CAR AT TIME OF PURCHASE FROM THE DEALER]  PURCHASED:11/30/2010
WHEN DRIVING CAR GOING ABOUT 45MPH.CAR SHUT OFF AND WRENCH WILL APPEAR ON DASHBOARD . I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COAST OFF THE ROAD , SHUT OFF CAR WAIT FOR A FEW MINUTES AND RESTART CAR . I AM IN FEAR THAT CAR WILL SHUT OFF IN AREA WHERE THERE IS NO SHOULDER  AND I WILL BE HIT FROM BEHIND . THERE SEEMS TO BE A PATTERN BUILDING WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM , SAME MODEL, SAME YEAR .
DRIVERS SIDE DOOR LATCH SWITCH SAYS IT IS NOT LATCHED, BUT IT IS.  THIS CAUSES THE INTERIOR DOME LIGHTS TO REMAIN ON WHILE DRIVING.  HARD TO DRIVE AT NIGHT WITH LIGHTS ON.  DANGEROUS.  DOORS DO NOT LOCK PROPERLY BECAUSE IT THINKS THE DOOR IS AJAR.  I UNDERSTAND THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ON THIS EXACT ISSUE.
I WAS ACCELERATING TO MERGE ONTO I-495 IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA, ATTAINING A SPEED OF APPROXIMATELY 55 MPH.  WHEN I REMOVED MY FOOT FROM THE GAS PEDAL (BECAUSE I HAD REACHED MY DESIRED SPEED), THE CAR CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE UNCONTROLLABLY.  I APPLIED FULL PRESSURE TO THE BREAK WITH BOTH FEET, BUT THE CAR CONTINUED TO SURGE FORWARD.  I ATTAINED A SPEED OF ALMOST 100 MPH, EVEN WITH BOTH FEET FULLY DECOMPRESSING THE BREAK.  BOTH SHOULDERS OF THE INTERSTATE HAD CONSTRUCTION, SO THERE WAS NO SHOULDER TO UTILIZE ON EITHER SIDE.  AFTER WEAVING IN AND OUT OF TRAFFIC, I FINALLY FOUND A SUITABLE OFF RAMP.  AFTER PULLING THE EMERGENCY BREAK, PUTTING THE CAR IN NEUTRAL, AND EVENTUALLY PARK, THE CAR CAME TO A VERY ABRUPT STOP (JUST BEFORE I REACHED A BUSY INTERSECTION AT THE END OF THE OFF RAMP).  THE BREAKS CONTINUED TO SMOKE FOR ANOTHER 45 MINUTES AFTER COMING TO A STOP AND CUTTING THE ENGINE.  I DO NOT KNOW HOW I'M ALIVE, BUT I AM GRATEFUL. *TR
CAR WAS PARKED AND CLOSED REAR LIFT GATE AND REAR WINDOW EXPLODED ON ME.  *TR
ENTERED LEFT TURN LANE TO APPROACH OFF RAMP, TRUCK STALLED. APPX 40MPH. TURNED OFF AND RESTARTED, DROVE HOME.  HAD NOTICED JUMPING RESPONSE FROM IDLE TO REVERSE TO DRIVE, PARTICULARLY UPON FIRST IGNITION OF DAY, FOR ABOUT A WEEK. HAVE CONTACTED DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR OF NOTED THROTTLE BODY ISSUE, WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR 1 WEEK FROM TODAY.  *TR
SIGNS OF ISSUE DURING THE OCCURRENCE:    -CAR STOP RUNNING  -THROTTLE ALARM SHOWED UP  -TRANSMISSION ALARM SHOWED UP  -THE ISSUE HAPPENS APPROX. 3 TO 4 TIMES A MONTH    YOU WILL NEED TO STOP AND TURN OFF YOUR ENGINE FOR A WHILE BEFORE YOU CAN START   DRIVING THE CAR AGAIN, THE THROTTLE ALARM WILL GO AWAY BUT THE TRANSMISSION STAYS SOMETIME  APPROXIMATELY AFTER 12 HOURS.  *TR
MY FORD WOULD NOT ACCELERATE, IT SPUTTERED AND WENT DEAD. IT WOULD NOT RESTART. IT HAD DONE THIS BEFORE BUT PREVIOUSLY I COULD RESTART IT. DEALERSHIP REPLACED THROTTLE BODY.  *TR
THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT THREE SEPARATE TIMES WHILE DRIVING IN HEAVY TRAFFIC. EACH TIME, I WAS BARELY ABLE TO PULL OVER AND TURN THE IGNITION OFF, WITHOUT BEING HIT BY TRAFFIC. I HAD TO TAKE MY SEATBELT OFF AND RAISE UP TO PUT MY FULL BODY WEIGHT ONTO THE WHEEL. AFTER THE THIRD ATTEMPT AT RESTARTING, THE POWER STEERING CAME BACK ON. I DRIVE ALMOST 50 MILES A DAY ON THE HIGHWAY TO AND FROM WORK, AND I'M VERY AFRAID TO DRIVE THIS CAR, AND WON'T LET MY KIDS RIDE IN IT NOW. PHONE CALLS TO FORD AND TWO LOCAL DEALERSHIPS HAVE BEEN NO HELP. I WAS TOLD THAT THEY DOUBT THAT A CODE WILL SHOW ANY PROBLEM WITH A DIAGNOSTIC CHECK, AND THAT IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO THE SERVICE EMPLOYEE, THERE IS NOTHING MORE THEY CAN DO. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT MINE IS THE FIRST REPORT OF THIS KIND, AND THAT A DIAGNOSTIC CHECK AND POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT COST WILL BE UP TO ME AS MY WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED. THERE ARE NUMEROUS ACCOUNTS OF THIS PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET, AND SHOULD NOT BE A WARRANTY ISSUE, IT'S A SAFETY ISSUE THAT FORD NEEDS TO ADDRESS.  *TR
AS MY WIFE WAS DRIVING ONE MORNING THE FORD ESCAPE WITH OUT WARNING STARTED TO FEEL LIKE THERE WAS NO THROTTLE WHEN SHE STEPPED IN THE GAS. SHE IMMEDIATELY PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD (COASTING BECAUSE THE GAS PEDDLE WASN'T RESPONDING. A LITTLE WRENCH (THROTTLE BODY/POWERTRAIN) LIGHT CAME ON, ON THE DASH. THIS HAPPENED TWICE ON THIS DAY, BOTH TIMES OUT OF THE BLUE. THE FORD DEALERSHIP LOOKED AT IT AND IT WAS THE THROTTLE BODY. THIS SHOULDN'T HAPPEN ON A VEHICLE SO NEW AND SUCH LOW MILEAGE. *TR
WAS DRIVING 2011 FORD ESCAPE AND CAR STARTED TO JERK AND DECELERATED WITH GAS PEDAL NOT DOING ANYTHING.  PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  THE POWERTRAIN WRENCH LIGHT HAD COME ON THEN THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT.  RESTARTED THE CAR A MINUTE LATER AND IT DROVE A FEW HUNDRED FEET BEFORE SAME THING HAPPENED AND WRENCH LIGHT CAME ON.  WILL GET CAR TOWED TO DEALERSHIP.  I AM A LONG-TIME FORD OWNER.  FORD NEEDS TO STEP TO THE PLATE AND ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.   *TR
SEVERAL WEEKS EARLIER, AS A WAS STOPPED AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT, MY CAR STARTED BUCKING OR SURGING, FEELING AS THOUGH IT WAS GOING TO STALL.  IT DID NOT STALL AT THAT POINT.  A FEW MINUTES LATER, AS A WAS SLOWED DOWN BY A BUS, IT DID STALL.  RESTARTED VERY EASILY AND I KEPT DRIVING.  EVERY FEW DAYS, WE WOULD NOTICE THE SURGING, AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON.  TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND THE WAS TOLD THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE FUEL SYSTEM, BUT THEY WEREN'T SURE WHAT EXACTLY.  STALLED A SECOND TIME POST DEALER VISIT.  THIS MORNING, AS I WAS IN MOTION AT 35 MILES AN HOUR, THE CAR SUDDENLY SHUT OFF.  I COASTED VERY EASILY TO THE SHOULDER, BUT COULD NOT RESTART.  CAR HAS BEEN TOWED TO THE LOCAL DEALER.  AWAITING THEIR ANSWER, BUT SOUNDS VERY MUCH LIKE THE OTHER THROTTLE BODY ISSUES I'VE READ ON HERE.  I'M FORTUNATE TO HAVE BEEN ON THE HIGHWAY YET, ESPECIALLY WITH MY YOUNG CHILD IN THE BACK SEAT.  THIS WAS A SCARY SITUATION, AND I'M NOT PLEASED THAT THE PREVIOUS RECALL DID NOT INCLUDE THE 2011 MODEL YEAR. PLEASE REOPEN THE INVESTIGATION.  *TR
THE VEHICLE EXPERIENCED A FUEL SURGE CAUSING A REACTION THAT WAS NOT INTENDED BY THE DRIVER. THE CAR JOLTEDAS IF ONE MASHED THE ACCELERATOR THEN RELEASED REPEATEDLY. ONCE THE VEHICLE CAME TO A STOP THE CAR SPIT AND SPUTTERED LIKE BAD ENGINE TIMING. WE TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF WHERE IT SAT OVERNIGHT. IT WAS HARD TO START THIS MORNING AND EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM TWICE THIS MORNING WHILE TAKING THE KIDS TO SCHOOL. I STOPPED BY AN ADVANCED AUTO PARTS STORE WHERE THE ATTENDANT  PULLED THE SERVICE CODE P2112 THROTTLE ACTUATOR STUCK CLOSED.  *TR
WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, THE CAR SUDDENLY SHUTTERED AND STALLED. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WENT ON AND THE DRIVER HAD TO GUIDE CAR TO SHOULDER WHILE AVOIDING ONCOMING TRAFFIC. NO ONE WAS INJURED BUT THE DRIVER WAS SCARED AND THIS WAS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO OUR SERVICE STATION AND THEY FOUND THAT THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE CONTROL WAS POTENTIALLY DEFECTIVE OR IMPAIRED.  *TR
AS I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD, ALL THE SUDDEN WITHOUT NOTICE, THE VEHICLE WENT TO 1 RPM AND 5 MILES PER HOUR.  TRIED TO ACCELERATE AND IT WOULD NOT, THEN THE WRENCH LIGHT CAME ON. I PUT ON MY FLASHERS IMMEDIATELY SO I WOULD NOT GET REAR ENDED BY CARS COMING FAST BEHIND ME.  THEN, THE VEHICLE STALLED OUT.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT NEVER CAME ON.  SAT THERE IN THE RAIN FOR A FEW MINUTES.  THEN, STARTED THE VEHICLE BACK UP AGAIN, TO GET IT HOME.  THEN, I WAS AFRAID TO DRIVE IT, CALLED THE FORD DEALER TO GET MY VEHICLE IN, THEY COULD NOT LOOK AT IT UNTIL MONDAY OF THE NEXT WEEK, SO HAD VEHICLE TOWED ON SATURDAY TO DEALER---EXTRA COST INVOLVED ON A 2 YEAR OLD VEHICLE.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT LOOKED AT IT, THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  I PICK UP THE VEHICLE ON 9/25/2013.  DROVE THE VEHICLE FOR 4 DAYS, THEN HAPPENED AGAIN ON 9/29/13 AND IT HAD BEEN RAINING.  THEN, DROVE THE NEXT DAY 9/30/13, AGAIN THREW THE WRENCH SYMBOL AFTER GOING TO 1 RPM AND 2 TO 5 MILES PER HOUR AND BUCKING, COULD NOT ACCELERATE AT ALL.  IT WAS DRY ON THIS DAY. AGAIN, PUT MY FLASHERS ON THIS TIME WAS GOING 30 MPH ON A NARROW TWO LANE ROAD.  REMEMBER THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT NEVER CAME ON, BUT THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND A CODE THIS TIME.  THEY SAID IT WAS THE THROTTLE BODY, SO I BEGAN ASKING MORE QUESTIONS AS TO WHY FORD HAS NOT RECALLED THIS SINCE SO MANY ACROSS THE USA ARE HAVING ISSUES.  NO ONE KNOWS, SO AS A CONSUMER ON A TIGHT BUDGET --LIKE MANY OF US THESE DAYS....GETS TO FIGURE OUT ALL THE MONEY PIECES.  I GUESS I WILL NEED A THIRD JOB JUST FOR VEHICLE REPAIRS ON A TWO YEAR OLD VEHICLE.   THIS WAS A VERY SCARY EXPERIENCE AND FORD NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BEFORE ANYONE ELSE IS SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED.  THIS PROBLEM SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING WITH A TWO YEAR OLD MAINTAINED VEHICLE.  NOW BECAUSE IT IS OVER THE 36,000 MILES MORE MONEY OUT OF POCKET....GEEZ.  *TR
THIS FOLLOWING INCIDENT HAPPENED BOTH YESTERDAY AND TODAY.  DRIVING AROUND 20 MPH AND SERVICE LIGHT CAME ON IMMEDIATELY DUMPING ME IN "LIMP MODE".  TOOK THE VEHICLE TO BOTH AUTOZONE AND ANOTHER PRIVATE REPAIR SHOP WITH BETTER DIAGNOSTICS, NEITHER COULD PICK UP A DEFECT CODE.  RESEARCH ON FORD ESCAPES TODAY, SHOWS THAT THIS COULD BE A PROBLEM.  I DO NOT WANT THE VEHICLE TO GO INTO LIMP MODE WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD.  HOPING THE NHTSA RECALLS THE ESCAPES TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. *JB
I WAS DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE AT 65 MPH WHEN MY 2011 FORD ESCAPE BEGAN TO DECELERATE RAPIDLY.  I TRIED GIVING IT GAS BUT EVEN WITH THE GAS PETAL PUSHED DOWN ALL THE WAY IT STILL WOULDN'T ACCELERATE AT ALL. I HAD TO PULL OVER IN THE EMERGENCY LANE SO I WASN'T HIT BY THE CAR BEHIND ME.  WHEN I CAME TO A STOP THE VEHICLE WAS SHAKING AND I NOTICED THAT A FLASHING WRENCH LIGHT WAS DISPLAYED.  I TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF FOR A MINUTE AND THEN RESTARTED IT WITH NO PROBLEMS.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE IT'S STILL UNDER WARRANTY AND THEY TOLD ME TO BRING IT IN AND THEY WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT IT. *JB
ON AUGUST 21, 2013 DRIVER OF A 2011 FORD ESCAPE WAS ATTEMPTING TO TURN AND ACCELERATE THE VEHICLE FROM A STOPLIGHT WHEN THE CAR JERKED FORWARD AND WOULD NOT ACCELERATE WITH ONCOMING TRAFFIC, AND WITH TRAFFIC MOVING BEHIND THE VEHICLE. THE DASHBOARD SHOWED A WRENCH LIGHT, AND DRIVE FOUND IT HARD TO STOP CAR AS IT WAS SPUTTERING AND JERKING FORWARD. THE CAR WAS FINALLY MOVED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, SHUT OFF, AND RESTARTED, AND DRIVE THE 10 MILES HOME. OWNER TOOK CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE THROTTLE BODY CODE WAS DISCOVERED. THIS PART IS NOT COVERED UNDER POWERTRAIN WARRANTY, THUS OWNER FIX COST IS $600.00. THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN ON THE VEHICLE, WHEN IT GOES INTO SAFE MODE THERE IS NO WARNING AND CAN CAUSE AN ACCIDENT WHEN THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY DECELERATES TO UNDER 1000 RPM. I BELIEVE FORD SHOULD RECALL THE FAULTY THROTTLE BODY IN THE 2009-2011 MODELS AS THEY ARE SAFETY ISSUES FOR DRIVERS IN THE CAR AND OTHER DRIVERS ON THE ROAD.  *TR
WHILE ATTEMPTING TO MERGE ONTO THE HIGHWAY I LOST ENGINE POWER IN MY CAR.  I WAS UNABLE TO ACCELERATE OR MOVE AND WHEN I PUT THE CAR INTO PARK IT BEGAN TO SHAKE.  I HAD TO TURN IT OFF AND TRY TO GET IT TO START SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE IT WOULD START AGAIN...  *TR
WHILE DRIVING ON AN EXPRESSWAY AROUND 35-40MPH, VEHICLE EXPERIENCED A SUDDEN LOSS OF POWER AND WENT INTO LIMP MODE (LESS THAN 1000RPM) WITH A WRENCH INDICATOR ILLUMINATED ON THE DASHBOARD. PULLED OVER, SHUT DOWN VEHICLE AND THEN RESTARTED ENGINE. VEHICLE WAS DRIVEN HOME AND TAKEN TO THE DEALERSHIP THE NEXT DAY. FORD DIAGNOSED AND IS REPLACING THE THROTTLE BODY UNDER POWERTRAIN WARRANTY.  *TR
I WAS DRIVING WITH MY TWO KIDS IN TRAFFIC ON 95 WHEN MY TRUCK JUST SEEMED TO STOP WORKING. IT DID NOT STALL, THE ENGINE WAS STILL WORKING, I COULD  STEER BUT COULD NOT ACCELERATE . I QUICKLY HAD TO GET OVER FOUR LANES TO THE SHOULDER . WHEN I DID, I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND WAITED A COUPLE MINUTES. I TURNED THE CAR BACK ON AND IT WAS A HARD START, ALMOST AS IF IT WERE GOING TO NOT START. TO GET .I  CALLED MY FORD DEALERSHIP AND EXPLAINED AS BEST AS I COULD TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT~ WHO IN TURN ,OVER THE PHONE DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS ELECTRICAL AND INFORMED ME MY WARRANTY WOULDN'T COVER IT, I SHOULD TAKE IT TO MY MECHANIC. I DROPPED MY TRUCK OFF  AND HE TRIED TO FIX WHATEVER MAY HAVE CAUSED THE PROBLEM, COSTING US $500. MY HUSBAND PICKED IT UP AND WE TOOK IT OUT THAT NIGHT ~ IT HAPPENED FIVE MORE TIMES . THIS WAS SATURDAY NIGHT, MONDAY I TRIED TO CALL FORD AND TELL THEM WHAT HAPPENED. I WAS ON THE PHONE OFF AND ON FOR ABOUT 3-4 HOURS TRYING TO HAVE THIS HANDLED. FINALLY, I WAS TOLD BY MY MECHANIC~NOT THE DEALERSHIP~ ABOUT THIS BEING SOMETHING I COULD LOOK UP, THAT OTHER OWNERS HAD THIS SAME EXACT ISSUE. FORD TOLD ME TO BRING IT IN ON WED, I HAD TO CALL FORD CORPORATE TO FIND OUT IF I WAS ENTITLED TO A RENTAL AND DID I HAVE TO PAY A $100 DEDUCTIBLE. IT WAS LIKE PULLING TEETH TO HAVE THIS HANDLED. ON WED WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO DROP IT OFF, AFTER MORE DISCONNECTED PHONE CALLS AND VOICEMAILS~ I ASKED TO SPEAK WITH A DIRECTOR OR MANAGER. IN MIND EXPERIENCE HE WAS TREATING ME AS IF I WERE A CHILD AND I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A PROBLEM WITH THE FORD ESCAPES.AFTER TELLING HIM WHAT I FOUND OUT ONLINE I WAS TOLD  "IF YOU READ ANYTHING ON THE INTERNET, THAT'S SIMPLY YOUR RESEARCH." I AM DISGUSTED WITH MY EXPERIENCE,MY TRUCK IS SUPPOSEDLY FIXED. I  DO NOT TRUST A COMPANY TO FIX SOMETHING THEY ARE PRETENDING DOESN'T EXIST.   *TR
MY FORD ESCAPE HAS STALLED 11 TIMES IN THE PAST FIVE DAYS. IT HAS HAPPENED AT VARIOUS SPEEDS, RANGING FROM 20 MPH TO 65 MPH. THE FIRST 8 TIMES THE VEHICLE STALLED (AS IF OUT OF GEAR), THE "WRENCH" LIGHT CAME ON THE DASH, AND I WAS ABLE TO COAST TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. AS I CAME TO A FINAL STOP EACH TIME, THE VEHICLE WOULD JERK AND THEN I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK. I TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF AND ATTEMPTED TO RESTART. THE VEHICLE HAD TROUBLE STARTING BUT FINALLY CAME BACK ON. AGAIN, THE SAME DESCRIPTION ABOVE HAPPENED ALL 8 TIMES. THESE INCIDENTS CAUSED SOME VERY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS, ONE WHERE THE VEHICLE STALLED AS I WAS CROSSING THE STREET TO TURN LEFT AND IT STALLED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND ANOTHER TIME WHEN IT STALLED GOING 65 MPH DOWN THE INTERSTATE WITH CARS FLYING UP BEHIND ME.I DID NOT IMMEDIATELY TAKE THE VEHICLE IN TO BE CHECKED BECAUSE I THOUGHT I JUST HAD A BAD BATCH OF GASOLINE.  THE LAST 3 TIMES THE INCIDENT HAPPENED (CAR STALLED AND THE GAS PEDAL WOULD NOT WORK) BUT THE "CHECK ENGINE" LIGHT CAME ON AND STAYED ON. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP THIS MORNING AND WAS TOLD THAT I NEED A NEW THROTTLE BODY AND IT IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. I AM TERRIFIED TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE AGAIN AND BECOME ANXIOUS AT EVERY BUSY INTERSECTION WONDERING IF IT WILL STALL OUT AGAIN. I HAVE READ MANY CONSUMER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SAME ISSUE AND ASK THAT FORD DO A RECALL ON THIS PART BEFORE A FATALITY OCCURS.  *TR
TRAVELING 70 MPH ON INTERSTATE NORTH WEST OF ATLANTA, GEORGIA AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING USING CRUISE CONTROL.  CRUISE CONTROL WENT OFF AND CAR HAD A CATASTROPHIC LOSS OF POWER.  NO RESPONSE TO THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL. THE OPEN END WRENCH EMBLEM CAME ON  THE DASH BOARD.  CAR SPEED DROPPED TO 2.5 MPH WITH OCCASIONAL DOUBLE SURGES UP TO 4.5 MPH.   HAD TO DRIVE ON SHOULDER FOR 1 1/2 MILES AT 2.5 MPH IN ORDER TO GET TO AN EXIT AND CALL FOR ASSISTANCE.  WAS ON MY OWN AND TOTALLY UNFAMILIAR WITH THE AREA.  CALLED FORD MOTOR ASSIST AND THEY TOWED VEHICLE TO DEALERSHIP.  THIS WAS A SUNDAY SO HAD TO SPEND NIGHT IN MOTEL BEFORE COULD SEE SERVICE PEOPLE.  DIAGNOSIS ENDED UP BEING THROTTLE CONTROL NEEDING REPLACED.  HAD COMPLAINED TO LOCAL DEALERSHIP ABOUT SOMETHING BEING WRONG WITH WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE TRANSMISSION AS THE CARE WOULD SURGE OR SHIFT FUNNY SEVERAL TIMES CLEAR UP TO JUST PRIOR TO REACHING 36,000 MILE WARRANTY.  SINCE THIS OCCURRED AT 37,195 AND 500 MILES AWAY FROM HOME IT WAS CONSIDERED AN OUT OF WARRANTY REPAIR AND COST $478.00.  I AM THANKFUL IT WAS 5:00 IN THE MORNING ON A SUNDAY AS HAD THIS OCCURRED IN RUSH HOUR IN A FURTHER LEFT HAND LANE, THE SUDDEN DECELERATION WOULD LIKELY HAVE CAUSE A BAD ACCIDENT.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM!!!!!  *TR
VEHICLE HAS STALLED MULTIPLE TIMES AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS WHICH FORD APPARENTLY CALLS "LIMP MODE".   ALL POWER TO THE MOTOR WAS GONE.  AS THIS ONLY HAS HAPPENED AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, I FEARED FOR MY LIFE THAT I WOULD GET REAR ENDED. APPARENTLY FORD KNOWS OF A PROBLEM WITH THE THROTTLE BODY BUT SINCE THE CAR NEVER KEEPS THE CODE IN THE COMPUTER, FORD WILL NOT DO ANY REPAIRS TO IT.   THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE AND AM WORRIED SOMEONE WILL BE KILLED BY THIS PROBLEM AND THE UNWILLINGNESS OF FORD TO REPAIR IT.  ONCE I COAST TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND TURN OFF THE MOTOR.... WAIT A MINUTE... AND RESTART THE PROBLEM GOES AWAY.   THIS HAS HAPPENED THREE TIMES TO ME ALREADY.  *TR
THE FIRST OF 4 INCIDENTS OCCURRED WHILE DRIVING ON THE BELT PARKWAY IN BROOKLYN NY. I WAS DRIVING AT A SPEED OF 65 MPH IN THE LEFT LANE ON A STRETCH OF HIGHWAY WITH NO SHOULDER ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD WHEN I LOST ALL PEDAL POWER. I WASN'T ABLE TO ACCELERATE. THE ENGINE WAS RUNNING AND ALL THE ELECTRONICS WERE WORKING PROPERLY EXCEPT FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCELERATE. THE SMALL ICON OF A WRENCH APPEARED ON THE DASH. I MANAGED TO CROSS THREE LANES OF HEAVY TRAFFIC TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER. I PUT THE VEHICLE IN PARK AND STEPPED ON THE ACCELERATOR TO REV THE ENGINE, NOTHING HAPPENED. IT  SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS NO GAS GETTING TO THE ENGINE. I THEN SHUT DOWN THE ENGINE AND CHECKED THE OWNERS MANUAL FOR THE  ICON OF THE WRENCH. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE WRENCH ICON STATES THAT A THROTTLE CONTROL/POWERTRAIN FAULT HAS BEEN DETECTED AND I SHOULD CONTACT AN AUTHORIZED DEALER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. UPON CONTACTING THE DEALER HE INDICATED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN HAVING A PROBLEM WITH THE THROTTLE BODY ON MY MAKE AND MODEL AND ALSO STATED THAT MY WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED AND THERE WAS NO RECALL ISSUED FOR THIS PROBLEM. THE COST WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY. I PROCEEDED TO HAVE THEM ORDER ME A NEW THROTTLE BODY. THE LEAD TIME WOULD BE 2-3 WEEKS FOR THE NEW PART. DURING THAT TIME THE SAME PROBLEM HAS HAPPENED 3 MORE TIMES, 2 OF WHICH WERE AT A SPEED OF 65 MPH AND 1 TIME STARTING OFF FROM A RED LIGHT AT A SPEED OF LESS THAT 10 MPH. AFTER RESEARCHING THIS PROBLEM ON LINE I HAVE FOUND  THIS TO BE A MAJOR ISSUE AND A RECALL FOR THE THROTTLE BODY SHOULD BE ISSUED AND REPAIRS MADE BY FORD AT NO COST TO THE OWNERS. I FEEL THAT I WAS PUT IN A VERY DANGEROUS LIFE THREATENING POSITION.  *TR
VEHICLE LOST POWER IN DRIVE AND DECELERATED.   FORD SERVICE DIAGNOSED FAILURE OF THE THROTTLE BODY.  *TR
WHILE DRIVING ON I40 MY VEHICLE LOST THE ABILITY TO ACCELERATE. I COASTED TO THE SHOULDER AND THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO SURGE FORWARD AND STOP WHILE I ATTEMPTED TO PUT IT IN PARK. THIS HAPPENED TWICE MORE ON THIS TRIP, AFTER RESTARTING THE ENGINE TO REST THE ISSUE SO I COULD DRIVE AT ALL. I HAVE TAKEN IT TO FORD THREE TIMES FOR SERVICE FOR THIS. THEY REST CODE AND TELL ME FORD IS AWARE OF THE DEFECT IN THE THROTTLE BODY BUT WON'T FIX IT FOR FREE. I AM IN FACT TYPING THIS COMPLAINT IN THE SERVICE WAITING AREA. I HAVE EXPERIENCED SURGES FORWARD WHILE SITTING IN TRAFFIC AND HAD ALL POWER DROP OUT AT INTERSTATE SPEEDS. IT'S INSANE FORD HASN'T RECALLED THIS PART AND REPAIRED IT. I HOPE ME OR MY FAMILY DON'T HAVE TO BE INJURED OR KILLED FOR THEM TO TAKE CARE OF THIS FAULTY PART.  *TR
WIFE PULLED OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY AND VEHICLE LOST ALL POWER AND WENT INTO LIMP HOME MODE. SHE STOPPED THE VEHICLE, PUT IT INTO PARK AND TURNED THE CAR OFF.  FIRST ATTEMPT TO RESTART VEHICLE FAILED, SECOND ATTEMPT, VEHICLE STARTED AND WRENCH SYMBOL ILLUMINATED AND STAYED ON APPROXIMATELY 20 MILES UNTIL SHE ARRIVED AT WORK.  SHE HAS ALSO BEEN EXPERIENCING INTERMITTENT SURGING FORWARD WHILE DRIVING AND TRANSMISSION BANGING INTO REVERSE WHEN BACKING OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY.  THE RPMS HAVE BEEN SURGING SPORADICALLY WHEN CRANKING THE CAR.  TOOK THE CAR TO FORD DEALER ON FRIDAY, 17 MAY 2013, RECEIVED A CALL FROM SERVICE REP. SAYING THAT THE THROTTLE BODY ASSEMBLY HAD TO BE REPLACED, BUT HOWEVER, PART IS ON BACKORDER AND THEY ARE SEARCHING NATIONWIDE FOR THE PART TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  HE ALSO STATED THAT HE DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE RETURNING THE VEHICLE FOR MY WIFE TO DRIVE UNTIL THE PART IS FOUND DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF HER HAVING A ACCIDENT. HOWEVER, UNTIL THEN, WE ARE OUT A VEHICLE, BECAUSE IT IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE. FORTUNATELY, THE VEHICLE IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IS THE MAGIC NUMBER FOR NTHSB TO FORCE FORD INTO ISSUING A RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM, HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO BE INJURED OR DIE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN ???????  *TR
PERIODICALLY THE VEHICLE SEEMS TO LOSE POWER OR HESITATED THEN ACCELERATE, I'VE NEVER HAD IT STALL OUT.  ALTHOUGH IT HAPPENED A FEW TIMES EARLY ON THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN MORE FREQUENT LATELY. I HAVE ALSO NOTICED THAT WHEN ACCELERATING, FOR EXAMPLE ON AN INCLINE, THE VEHICLES TAKES SEVERAL MINUTES TO SHIFT INTO GEAR.  THE VEHICLE IDLES VERY ROUGH, IT HAS BEEN SINCE I BOUGHT IT BUT HAS GOTTEN WORSE RECENTLY. I'VE MENTIONED IT TO THE TECHNICIAN WHEN I'VE TAKEN IT IN FOR SERVICE AND WAS TOLD THIS IS NORMAL FOR A FOUR CYLINDER.  I'VE HAD MANY CARS OVER THE YEARS 4 CYL AND 6 CYL AND I'VE NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN.  I'VE READ SOME OF THE OTHER COMPLAINTS WITH THE SAME DESCRIPTION AS WHAT MY VEHICLE IS DOING.  *TR
AFTER STOPPING AND UPON ACCELERATION THE ENGINE COMPLETELY SHUTS DOWN AND THE CAR STALLS.  AFTER PUTTING THE CAR IN PARK AND RESTARTING THE CAR, IT RUNS OKAY.  THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME 4 TIMES OVER A 23 MONTH PERIOD.  EACH TIME I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THE FIRST TWO TIMES I WAS TOLD THE CAR WAS STILL BREAKING IN AND IT MUST BE DUE TO THE GAS I WAS USING.  THE THIRD TIME, THEY REPLACED THE THROTTLE BODY.  TO MY KNOWLEDGE THE "WRENCH" LIGHT ONLY CAME ON ONCE. THEY SAID THEY HAD A NUMBER OF VEHICLES THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED WITH AND REPLACING THE THROTTLE BODY HELPED.  THREE WEEKS AFTER THEY REPLACED THE THROTTLE BODY, IT HAPPENED AGAIN!   THIS TIME ONLY THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  FORD SAYS THEY NEED A CODE TO TRY TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS ONE OTHER PERSON, WHO HAS THE SAME MAKE AND MODEL AS MINE THAT THIS IS HAPPENING TOO.  THIS PERSON ALSO HAD THE THROTTLE BODY REPLACED.  THE FACT THAT NO CODE IS TRIPPED IS A PROBLEM IN ITSELF!  PLEASE HELP!  I DO NOT WANT ANYONE TO BE KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM.  *TR
WHILE TRAVELING 80MPH ON THE INTERSTATE, MY 2011 FORD ESCAPE WITH 27000 MILES SUDDENLY LOST POWER AS A WRENCH INDICATOR LIGHT CAME ON THE DASHBOARD. THE GAS PEDAL WOULD NOT ACCELERATE TO PULL ONTO SHOULDER OR TO MOVE AROUND TRAFFIC. ALL FUEL ACCELERATION WAS LOST. AS I FINALLY COASTED TO THE SHOULDER, NARROWLY AVOIDING BEING THE CAUSE OF MULTIPLE ACCIDENTS, THE VEHICLE STARTING SHAKING. I TURNED THE CAR OFF, WAITED A FEW MINUTES, AND TURNED THE CAR BACK ON. THE WRENCH INDICATOR LIGHT (POWERTRAIN INDICATION) REMAINED OFF AND THE VEHICLE ACTED NORMAL. THERE WAS NOT AN INDICATION BEFORE OR AFTER THE INCIDENT OF ANY FAULTY SYSTEMS OR PARTS. THE VEHICLE DID THIS WITHOUT ANY REASON, LEAVING ME IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION. THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN PROPERLY MAINTAINED AND RUNNING WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS SINCE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE UNTIL THIS INCIDENT. I FEAR IT MAY HAPPEN AGAIN WITHOUT REASON AND PLACE MY LIFE AND THOSE OF MY PASSENGERS IN HARMS' WAY.  *TR

Sunroof will not close and every time it rains it leaks so much to the point that it’s going to cause more electrical issues. I will not take this back to the Randy Marion dealership in west Jefferson NC they also sold me this car with a bad transmission which ended back up in the shop for 3 plus months. They were completely incompetent about handling the situation. So I will not go back to them. Also they sold this cat with seatbelts that are so lose if I were to have a wreck I would probably go through the windshield. They didn’t want to repair that without me handling the bill.
TWO THINGS: Transmission failed, as it frequently does, in this car at around 90K. Shop said it's a known flaw  and Ford said sorry, despite having pointed related issues out to our dealer several times. Replaced at tranny shop to the tune of $7K+. Less than a year later, the engine failed due to known structural flaw with cylinders where coolant intrudes. Engine completely shot - dealer said sorry pay us $13K to replace it. Both these things have been parts of class-action lawsuits. Please remedy. Thank you.
The door panel falls off the door very easily and then becomes stuck. The door cannot open due to the panel catching on the floor of the car.  This is dangerous to have a door that does not work. I brought my car to Ford to get this fixed and after having my car for 6 days, the next time I drove on the freeway it fell off again and has the same problem. I've seen multiple reports of this
I was stopped at a stop light and when it turned green and I stepped on the gas the engin reved up but the car would not move. I looked down to see if the gear shift had been moved and when I saw it had not I stepped on the gas again and this time slowly moved and then jerked to a stop. I stepped on the gas again and it started rolling and the spead up so that it peeled out and then jerked to a stop again. I was right by a Les Swab and very slowly was able to pull into their parking lot. I had just had my breaks done and thought maybe something went wrong with them. They checked and said it was the transmission. I was afraid to try to drive it so I towed it home. After seeing other Ford Escape transmissions haveing issues and being recalled I wanted to report this. It sounds just like the complaints that are listed for the recalled transmissions. After checking with a local transmission shop they told me they had replaced 3 of these transmissions in the last month. So I know a lot of people do not look into this kind of stuff but I want someone to know this was very scary for me and if there had been another car close to me there could have been a accident.
The contact owns a 2015 Ford Escape. The contact stated that the vehicle would leak coolant, and needed to be refilled consistently. The vehicle was taken to the local dealer where a hole in the coolant tank was discovered and replaced the tank, however, the coolant continued to leak and the engine warning light illuminated. The vehicle was taken back to the dealer where it was diagnosed and advised that the Turbo engine eco boost failed and that the vehicle coolant was leaking into the engine. As a result, the engine needed to be replaced. The contact referenced NHTSA Campaign Number: 12V551000 (ENGINE AND ENGINE COOLING). The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 136,000.
My daughter borrowed my car and experienced a loud rattling noise.  We had it towed to our local shop who recommended bringing it to a Ford Dealership for the issue.  We had it towed there and I was informed after they looked at it that we had a cracked flex plate.  It horrifies what could have happened while she was in the car.  There was a check engine light on, but that was not connected to this issue apparently because I had to pay an additional cost to get that fixed.   I have never heard of a cracked flex plate but when I googled it I found Ford had several recalls for it, but not attached to my VIN
The contact owns a 2015 Ford Escape. The contact stated that while her daughter was driving approximately 45 MPH, the vehicle started losing motive power and then stalled.

DRIVING ALONG JUST FINE WENT PASS ANOTHER CAR ON THE ROAD. WHILE ACELARATING THE MADE A SUDDEN HARD SHIFT AND THEN STARTED TO HESSITATE. THE CAR DID THIS DOWN TOWN PHX 75 TO 25 CAUSING TO CARS BEHIND ME TO CRASH INTO EACH OTHER SO YEAH I HAVE TO SAY THAT WOULD BE A SAFTEY ISSUE. AS IT WAS DOING THIS THE CAR SAID TRANSMISSION FAILURE. SO I HAD THE CAR TOWED AND WHEN I GOT IT HOME I HOOKED IT UP TO MY AUTEL CODE READER BI DIRECTIONAL SCANNER. THERE WAS A PROPLEM WITH 1ST GEAR NOT HAVING THE CORRECT RATIO AND 6TH GEAR INVALID RATIO. THAT IS ALL IT SAID.
I am writing to bring to your attention a critical safety issue I recently encountered with my 2015 Ford Escape. I am deeply concerned about the lack of response and accountability from Ford regarding this matter, and I kindly request your assistance in addressing this potentially life-threatening problem. During a recent incident, my vehicle's power steering suddenly failed, rendering the car extremely difficult to maneuver. The lack of power steering made it nearly impossible for me to maintain a straight line, let alone perform any evasive maneuvers to avoid potential hazards on the road. Fortunately, this incident occurred in a drive-thru, and my children were not present in the vehicle at the time. I dread to think of the consequences if this failure had happened while driving at higher speeds or in a more critical situation. Upon taking my car to the Ford dealership for inspection and repair, I was shocked to learn that the power steering issue is not covered under my warranty. The dealership informed me that because my vehicle has exceeded 60,000 miles and is now over four years old, it falls outside the warranty coverage. I find it deeply troubling that Ford refuses to acknowledge the obvious flaw in the design of the car's power steering system, especially when comparable Ford models such as the 2011-2013 Fusion have been recalled for the exact same issue. As a loyal Ford customer, I implore you to thoroughly investigate and address this widespread problem, not only for my own sake but also for the safety and well-being of countless other Ford owners who may be facing similar risks. This dangerous design flaw poses a significant threat to drivers and their passengers, and it is utterly irresponsible for Ford to shirk responsibility and shift the financial burden onto the customers.
While putting the vehicle in park, the vehicle continued to roll and accelerate in an unintended direction, forward. This caused the vehicle to crash into and through a house, causing around $15,000 worth of damage. The vehicle remained difficult to control for the driver.
I took my 2015 Ford Escape to Gary Yeomans Ford Ocala for 2 recall items and they wanted to charge me for the recall items.  My Vin#[XXX]  Making me pay for recall items is illegal and they should be prosecuted. IMHO  Where can I go to have the recall items fixed without having to pay for them?

The contact owns a 2015 Ford Escape. The contact stated that the rear back up camera failed to operate as needed with a blank on the display screen. The vehicle was taken to the dealer where the contact was informed that the Accessory Protocol Interface Module (APIM) was defective and needed to be replaced. The contact was then notified of NHTSA Campaign Number: 15V406000 (Electrical System); however, the vehicle was not included in the recall. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 72,000.

Our 2015 Escape is having the same problem as the recall recently released for the 2020-23 models. We are getting terrible fuel smell inside the vehicle. Getting unsafe to drive.
The temperature gauge pegged-out at FULL HOT in a matter of seconds, the engine overheated. The safety risk would be a seized or blown engine while driving. The problem was checked by  two independent auto repair facilities and an authorized dealer service department.  The authorized dealer representative said the vehicle had a "coolant invasion of the #1 cylinder.  The car had a defective block so changing the head gasket was not recommended, replacing the engine was the prescribed fix.  Each week for a period of three weeks the 'check engine' light came on. I went to my mechanic and he checked it out with his electronic engine diagnostic port, each time it showed that the #1 cylinder misfired.   He could not find any reason/couldn't figure it out.  The fourth week when the screen showed red when the engine overheated was the first time there was a light/warning other than the check engine.  I immediately stopped, turned the engine off, opened the hood and notice the antifreeze reservoir was empty.   Sharing this information helped my mechanic to piece the problem together and said the antifreeze was getting into cylinder #1and that I needed a head gasket, which was confirmed by another mechanic.  They both recommended going to Ford for the work since they could get the part(s) quicker and perform the work more timely.   Since Ford said the engine was defective then why doesn't Ford assist in the cost of repair and/or replacement?
All four of my 235/55R17 103V XL tires are dry rotting. They are separating and creating a crack all along the tire shoulder. I bought these tires brand new in January 2020, they are not even 3 years old yet. The tires can blow due to the dry rotting causing me to crash, getting them replaced ASAP. No warning to them getting worse, until I did a tire check early this month.

After the contact was able to turn off the vehicle, the instrument panel and radio remained operational. There were no warning lights illuminated. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The VIN was not included in NHTSA Campaign Number: 15V436000 (Electrical System). The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 97,800.
I have been trying to schedule an appointment for the following recall. The dealership tells me that Ford does not have a fix for the shifter cable bushing.  How long do they have to come up with a fix. Jan 01,2001 Manufacturer Recall Number22S25 NHTSA Recall Number22V254 Recall StatusRecall Incomplete Summary IT MAY BE POSSIBLE THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTER CABLE BUSHING IS DAMAGED OR MISSING.
The bushing connecting the shifter to transmission broke and popped off causing the car to not go into park and not be able to turn on again after shutting the car off. Had to attempt to push broken bushing down to get it into park and have the car towed due to safety concern.
While driving I hear a pump sound and my car will die ,  I stop traffic all behind me until I can get it started again
Took car in for maintenance (my Ford dealer) and was told needed new lug nuts. Was informed that it is “a known issue” with the lug nuts. I don’t see a recall but see quite a few issues reported. If their as dangerous as implied by the dealer then why not on recall. Was quoted over $300 to replace them.
On 5/22/2021 when I was pulling into the parking space in front of my house my 2015 Ford Escape accelerated on its own, jumping the railroad tie at the edge of the parking lot and on to the front yard – fortunately the car stopped when I applied the break only less than five feet from the front of my house.  I put the car in reverse and removed my front from the break and the car accelerated on its own again.  I applied the break again and it stopped, thankfully there were no other cars in the parking lot at that time.    On 5/24/2021 I called the Ford dealership where I purchased the vehicle, the service advisor said they were not aware of this issue.  I had the vehicle towed to the dealership that day as I was concerned that the issue would reoccur ($80.00).  The service advisor called on Wednesday and stated there were no codes on the computer related to acceleration but there were codes for the transmission. They were able to overhaul the transmission, $3999.41; there was only 38,384 miles on the vehicle, I have always been a responsible owner and maintained all of my vehicles - I have no doubt this was a defect.  I had no other issues with this vehicle prior to that day.
ON THE DATE OF 04/07/21 I WAS DRIVING ON MY WAY TO WORK, HAD PULLED OUT OF DUNKIN DONUTS AND WENT UP A SMALL HILL TO A STOP SIGN I HAD THE AC ON, AND MY WINDOW ROLLED DOWN AS I JUST LEFT A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT  AND AS I GET TO THE TOP OF THE SMALL HILL, MY AC TURNS OFF AND MY CAR DISPLAYS A MESSAGE SAYING TRANSMISSION NOT IN PARK AND IT COMPLETELY SHUTS OFF, I PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND TRIED RESTARTING IT AND NOTHING I HAD DASH LIGHTS EVERYTHING BUT DIDN'T START. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED IN A 2 WEEK PERIOD, THE FIRST TIME IT SHUT OFF AND DISPLAYED A STARTING SYSTEM FAIL MESSAGE TOOK IT TO DEALER AND CANNOT FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEM. COULD THIS BE RELATED TO A RECALL!

I PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND IT CONTINUED TO ROLL! I COULD NOT GET THE SHIFTER TO MOVE AND THE CAR WOULD NOT START. I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO THE NEAREST DEALER. THANK GOODNESS I WAS IN A PARKING LOT WHEN THIS HAPPENED
I WENT TO MAKE A TURN INTO A PARKING LOT I LOST STEERING AND A LIGHT APPEARED ON DASH THAT SAID DRIVER ASSIST.I WRESTLED TO GET VEHICLE HOME AFTER WAITING TO NEXT DAY TO HAVE SOMEONE FOLLOW TO DEALER STEERING CANE BACK BUT WHEN I ARRIVED TO TURN INTO DEALER STEERING WENT OUT AGAIN WHICH IS DANGEROUS.I TALKED TO DEALER WHO SHOWED ME A LOT OF  PEOPLE WITH THIS STYLE VEHICLE HAVE HAD SAME PROBLEM BUT NO RECALL AND QUOTED $2400.00 TO REPAIR WHICH I COULD NOT AFFORD.THE VEHICLE IS 5YRS OLD WITH 4100 MILES
THIS VEHICLE HAS APPROX 45,000 MILES, REGULARLY SERVICED. HUSBAND DROVE HOME FROM WORK AND HAD ISSUES ACCELERATING. RPM'S WOULD GO UP BUT THE CAR DIDN'T SEEM TO RESPOND VERY WELL TO PUSHING ON THE GAS. TOOK IT TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP WHO TOLD US THE TRANSMISSION WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED AS A PIECE OF IT (NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT PIECE) HAD BROKEN OFF WITHIN THE TRANSMISSION AND HAD DESTROYED IT.
I WAS DRIVING ON THE ROAD, AND OUT OF NO WHERE, MY CAR JUST STOPPED MOVING.  IT WAS STILL ON, BUT WOULDN'T MOVE.  AFTER PUTTING THE ACCELERATOR ALL THE WAY DOWN, AND AFTER ABOUT 20 SECONDS, IT FINALLY MOVED BUT WAS REALLY JERKY FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MINUTES UNTIL I WAS HOME.  WHEN I TRIED TO TAKE IT TO GET CHECKED, IT DID THE SAME THING.  I PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, TURNED MY CAR OFF, WAITING SEVERAL MINUTES, AND STARTED IT AGAIN.  IT WOULD RUN FINE FOR SEVERAL YARDS, THEN DO THE SAME THING, WHERE IT WOULD JUST STOP MOVING.  A CLEAR SAFETY HAZARD WHEN DRIVING ON THE ROAD AND THE CAR JUST STOPS MOVING.  IT'S CURRENTLY AT A FORD DEALERSHIP NOW, AND I AM WAITING TO HEAR BACK.  I HAVE NOTICED THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH THE 2015 FORD ESCAPE.  THIS IS ALSO TERRIBLE BECAUSE THE CAR IS ONLY 4 YEARS OLD AND ONLY HAS A LITTLE OVER 60,000 MILES ON IT.  THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING, ESPECIALLY IN MULTIPLE CARS!

THEY TOLD ME TO PUT SEAFOAM GAS TREATMENT IN DIDN'T WORK. THE STALLING KEPT HAPPENING AFTER DRIVING A  LONG DISTANCE. AFTER MANY TIMES TO THE DEALER (1TIME THEY KEPT IT 2 WEEKS) THEY STILL COULDN'T FIND THE PROBLEM? DEALER DECIDED TO REPLACE THE THROTTLE BODY AND MOTOR ASY THE ONLY THING THAT CONTROLS THE IDLE. IT STILL CONTINUED TO STALL ON AND OFF AFTER A LONG RIDE. THEN IN FEB. 2016 IT STALLED ON I-75 SEVERAL TIMES THIS TIME NOT EVEN 10 MILES FROM WORK. WE WERE GOING SLOW DUE TO ICY ROADS HAVING TO PUT IN NEUTRAL JUST TO KEEP FROM STALLING. BACK TO DEALER, NOTHING SHOWED UP ON COMPUTER. MY WIFE THEN CALLED DEALER CONCERNED THAT IT COULD STALL WHILE DRIVING 70MPH ON THE HIGHWAY THE DEALER DECIDED TO REPLACE THE THROTTLE BODY AND MOTOR ASY AGAIN.

Rear view camera is not working properly. Will either flicker on & off while reversing, display upside down, or just show a black screen. This has been going on for a while. There seems to be a recall for this malfunction for several Ford models, however not one for my model.
While driving my vehicle my vehicle would suddenly stall while in motion. This stalling happens while driving and has stalled in the middle of intersections causing passing vehicles to slam there breaks to avoid hitting me. In addition my vehicle has stalled and almost causing rear end collisions. There would be no warning signs or no lamps that turn on when it first stalls. After the initial stalling of the vehicle it would rough idle, tug and continue to stall. Until I get to a destination. A check engine lamp may turn on once in awhile but not always. If the mechanic shop is closed and I try to take my car the next day the lamp would be off and it would not stall anymore until I use it further.  I have taken my car to a Napa when the engine lamp turned on and pulled a code for fuel pump. Although when I get it to my mechanic the light has turned off and they cant get a code from it. This has been happening for approximately a year now. It also seems to happen when fuel gets to quarter tank or less. This happens multiple times approximately 1-2 times everyb2 weeks.
While in reverse gear, during operation rear view camera stopped working and shows error that back up Camera is not available. Screen shows blue screen. It is very dangerous as it can cause an accident.
The contact owns a 2016 Ford Escape. The contact stated after reversing at 5 MPH and shifting to drive(D), the vehicle failed to respond as intended and continued to reverse. The contact stated that the failure recurred on several occasions. No warning light was illuminated. The vehicle was taken to the dealer for diagnostic testing; however, the dealer attempted to convince the contact to trade-in the vehicle. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 60,000.
The contact owns a 2016 Ford Escape. The contact stated that upon reversing out of the driveway, the power steering assist failed with the "Steering Assist Fault Service required" message displayed on the instrument panel. The dealer was notified of the failure and instructed the contact to bring the vehicle to the dealer. The vehicle was taken to the dealer and the contact was informed that the steering angle sensor module was defective. The mechanic replaced the part and then discovered that the steering was not operating as needed. The manufacturer was notified by the dealer about the issue and the contact was informed that the gear assembly needed to be replaced. The contact reached out to the manufacturer and was informed that the VIN was not under recall. The contact was then provided an estimate for the repair. The vehicle remained with the dealer unrepaired. The failure mileage was approximately 33,000.
The felt undercarriage cover keeps coming off the bottom of the vehicle. Completely fell off first time, and dealership screwed it back on. Approximately 60 days later it was hanging again. Dealer said it isn't needed if I don't drive on dirt roads and removed it. Not clear as to the safety concern to the under part of the vehicle and engine protection.
Backup camera fails intermittently and unpredictability. Often just a blank blue screen appears, sometimes an error message over a video image appears, and other times the camera works at first but fails after a few seconds.  It can work one minute, and the next time the car is shifted into reverse (such as when parallel parking) it may not work (or vice-versa).  OBDII fault codes indicate a possible communications/electrical issue. Online reports reveal that there are scores of other owners of model year 2014-2019 Ford Escapes with the same or similar issues with their back-up cameras (one mentioned having theirs replaced at least _4 times_ while the car was still in its warranty period). No other warning lamps are available. The alert text that (only sometimes) appears on the display screen when the camera fails is non-specific (e.g. “Camera not available.”).  This has been occurring for at least the last 3 or 4 years.  For all intents and purposes, since this fault is so unpredictable, I can no longer consider this car to possess a back-up camera.  Safety: while I have never had a serious, another driver could easily fail to see and possibly collide with property or individuals while reversing (especially when the camera image disappears in the middle of an in-progress reversing operation).  I am more than happy to make my vehicle available for inspection upon request.  Ford has issued a recall for the seemingly identical issue for 2020 model year vehicles, but not for my 2016 Ford Escape (nor, to my knowledge, many other model years using an identical camera and display design).
Catastrophic engine failure. "Engine skipped timing; timing codes coolant intrusion in cylinder#1 inside cylinder head".  Car towed to Portland Oregon Ford dealership and remains there. When warning lights appeared saying "engine failure pull over safely", the driver pulled over; it was not a safe area to be parked indefinately.  The Escape vehicle has needed towing twice for related engine /coolant problems including driver being on a road out of town alone and needing to take a bus back home from the rural area. Engine/vehicle is available at dealership for inspection. Problem has been recreated and the Ford mechanic has given the above description.
Uncontrollable acceleration increase; Difficult and rough starting; Engine overheating warning lights and message alerts; Coolant empty and no visible leak; Continued loss of coolant; Copious moisture smelling of anti freeze coming from exhaust; Check engine light codes: P1450, P1450 pd, PO302
I have 2 ford escapes a 2015 and a 2016 (2016 referenced in this complaint) both have experienced catastrophic transmission failure within weeks of each other. The transmission would slip and hard shift, eventually disable completely and would indicate the transmission needed to be serviced.
Out of the blue on highway. Tachometer reved up to 6 without using throttle.  No power, then it jumped out of gear to neutral down a hill. I almost got hit by a truck ,  no dash lights came on till I called fot help and my husband drove to a safe area and ford escape reared up in air .   Then transmission default light came on .   A guy put transmission module in to it and it didn't work.  So this is not right if it was recalled and now it is doing the issue later
engine coolant leaking into cylinders 1&2, causing check engine light to come on, misfires (over a period of 6 months)and block to crack. Had to replace. Bought escape in April 2023, Have car loan plus personal loan to pay for repairs. This was caused by defective design. Caused finical hardship for us. Could have caused engine overheating and fire. I will download one document for engine replacement, I have to many to download.
The car has a clicking noise and  recently I lost power steering. I didn’t see any codes but was not looking as I was terrified I couldn’t get home.
Vehicle over heated and had to pull over to cool it down. Got vehicle home safe and check engine light was on. 116867 T1.0 for diag verified customer's concern. Quick test P1299, P0217, P0219 for over temp condition. removed spark plugs and found coolant intrusion into all the cylinders, WSM direction is to replace the long black.  This same issue is happening with other Escapes and are on the recall list. I am requesting my VIN/car be added to the recall for the same issue.
My 2016 Ford Escape was in park and when I tried to put it in drive it went backwards almost into the car behind me. Luckily they saw something happening and backed up or I would of hit them.  It wouldn't shift into gear.  I put it in sport mode to get it to move forward then moved it into a safe location and shut it off.  It was a hot day so I thought maybe it was overheating.  It started fine and went about a mile before shuddering and refusing to shift into gear.  I managed to get it home but the Transmission Fault Service Now light came on as I was pulling into the driveway.  Had it towed to the dealership and was told it wasn't the recall bushing that went but a part inside my transmission and it would be $8200 for a new transmission.  What if I had been on the highway when this happened? This is a serious safety issue which could of caused a crash and injury.

Car suddenly would not shift and engine revved without moving in the middle of driving. This is an extreme hazard as my 2 year old son and I were pulling out into traffic. Had to turn the car off and back on and was able to get off the road. The transmission died without warning and the car is only at 55k miles.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2016 FORD ESCAPE. THE CONTACT STATED WHILE DRIVING 25 MPH, THE CHECK ENGINE WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED. THE CONTACT STATED SHE CONTINUED DRIVING THE VEHICLE. ON A ANOTHER OCCASION WHILE DRIVING 70 MPH, THE HOT TEMPERATURE SENSOR WARNING LIGHT WAS ILLUMINATED. THE CONTACT PARKED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE WENT BACK TO NORMAL. THE CONTACT STATED SHE CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC AND THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED THAT THE ENGINE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DRIVABLE. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO CORWIN FORD SALES INC (5107 US-250, MANNINGTON, WV 26582, (304) 986-1111) AND WAS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING REPAIRED. THE VEHICLE HAD NOT BEEN DIAGNOSED NOR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER HAD BEEN INFORMED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 55,000.
I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AT ABOUT 65 MPH WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN OUT OF NOWHERE I COULDN'T ACCELERATE ANYMORE IT WAS ALMOST LIKE I WAS STUCK IN NEUTRAL BUT I WAS CLEARLY IN DRIVE. I BEGAN HAVING OTHER DRIVERS HONK AT ME AND TRYING TO PASS ME, I HAD MY DAUGHTER IN THE CAR WITH ME, IT WAS REALLY SCARY. I COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN IN A ACCIDENT. I PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY, TURNED MY HAZARDS ON, AND CALLED A TOW TRUCK. THE MECHANIC SAID MY TRANSMISSION WAS DONE AND I NEEDED A NEW ONE, HE ALSO SAID THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE FORD ESCAPES. I REPAIRED IT IT COST 5600$. THE PART THAT BOTHERED ME MOST WAS WHEN I CONTACTED FORD THEY DIDN'T CARE ONE BIT. I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND FORD NEEDS TO RECALL THIS PART AND MAKE IT RIGHT AND STAND BEHIND THEIR NAME, BECAUSE I GUARANTEE THEY ARE FULLY AWARE OF THIS HAPPENING AND YET FAIL TO RECALL IT AND FIX IT.
WHILE DRIVING IN TRAFFIC THE CAR LUNGES FORWARD AND JERKS IN TRAFFIC AND LOSSES POWER. NO TO LITTLE MOVEMENT WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING. ALSO YOU CAN NOT ACCELERATE THAT IS A NON FACTOR AND YOU ARE IN THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC WITHOUT WARNING! MY CAR NEVER GAVE ME ANY SIGNS OF A BAD TRANSMISSION UNTIL OUT THE BLUE ONE DAY AND A TRANSMISSION VAULT LIGHT CAME ON MY DASH! MY FAMILY AND I WAS VISITING MY SON AT HIS COLLEGE  TOWN OF BEVERCREEK OHIO WERE HE ATTENDED WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY AND THIS HAPPENED ON THE WEEKEND. I WAITED UNTIL THE WEEKDAY TO CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE AND FORD GAVE ME A CASE #CAS27510020. MY SON DROPPED IT OFF AND MADE THE APPOINTMENT AND RENTED A CAR AND DROVE BACK TO CHICAGO. THE CAR IS AT GERMAINE FORD AND THEY CALLED HIM BACK AND SAID $4 THOUSAND OVERHAUL OR $8 THOUSAND FOR REPLACEMENT AND I STILL OWE A YEAR OR 2 YEARS WORTH OF PAYMENTS TOTALLY UNFAIR. A CAR SHOULD LAST LONGER THAN 85,000 MILES OFF HIGHWAY AND NORMAL DRIVING! P.S FORD HAS BEEN SUED FOR THERE POWER SHIFT TRANSMISSION FOR BAD TORQUE CONVERTERS , WHO'S TO SAY THEY ARE NOT USING THOSE SAME TORQUE CONVETERS IN THEIR 6SPEED AUTOMATIC SELECT SHIFT TRANSMISSIONS.
I BELIEVE THE SAME ISSUE WITH PREVIOUS MODELS OF FORD ESCAPES AND OTHER MODELS WITH THE RECALL BASED ON THE COOLANT LEAKING INTO THE ENGINE AND CAUSING BURNING AND FIRES IS STILL A RELEVANT ISSUE IN MODELS FURTHER. I BOUGHT MY 2016 FORD ESCAPE A YEAR AGO FROM CARMAX WITH 61K MILES. WITHIN ONE MONTH AND CONSTANT SERVICE THE CAR WOULD NOT STOP BURNING COOLANT. NO LEAKS OR ANYTHING I PAID TO HAVE IT CHECKED BY THREE DIFFERENT MECHANICS BECAUSE ALL OF THEM TOLD ME THERE HAD TO BE A LEAK. CARMAX STATES THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THEY CAN NOT COVER. BUT IT SEEMS TO NOT BE ANY PERSON AT FAULT. THERE ARE NO LEAKS I'VE HAD THE CAR INSPECTED. IT'S STILL RUNS A YEAR LATER, BUT CATCHES ON FIRE IF LEFT RUNNING IN PARK OR IDLE FOR MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES. SMOKES A TON FIRST THEN SOMETHING IGNITES. EVERY TIME YOU START IT THOUGH THERE'S A CLOUD OF THICK WHITE SMOKE WHICH EVENTUALLY CLEARS WHILE I'M DRIVING. DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO REPAIR THIS SO I HAVE TO KEEP DRIVING IT LIKE THIS. FORD HAS HAD THIS ISSUE ALREADY IN THE PREVIOUS MODELS. I'VE ATTACHED THE CUTOUT FROM THE PRIOR RECALL ON PREVIOUS MODELS. I APPRECIATE AND THANKYOU FOR YOUR TIME. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE APART OF HELPING THE BIGGER PICTURE.
FORD ESCAPE 2016, WHILE DRIVING ON THE STREET MY CAR STARTED SMOKING FROM THE HOOD I STOPPED IMMEDIATELY CHECKED FOR WATER, COOLANT WATER WAS EMPTY SO I FILLED WATER AND I TOOK TO THE MECHANIC SHOP THEY SAID ITS COOLANT RESERVOIR
WHILE DRIVING IN HIGHWAY, CAR BEGAN TO INCREASE ACCELERATION SUDDENLY AND BEGAN TO LOSE SPEED.  TRANSMISSION COULD NOT ENGAGE AND VEHICLE WOULD NOT MOVE. STRANDED IN HIGHWAY.  CAR WAS TOWED TO FORD DEALER. MILEAGE WAS 61,700 AND FORD REFUSED  COVER UNDER 60K POWERTRAIN WARRANTY. TRANSMISSION WAS REBUILT BY DEALER AT A COST OF $3,400.
2 WEEKS AFTER I PURCHASED MY 2016 FORD ESCAPE,  THE RADIO STARTED TO TURN OFF AND ON, THEN RANDOMLY STARTED CHANGING STATIONS ON ITS OWN. ALSO, WHEN THE BLUETOOTH IS IN USE, AFTER ENDING A CALL THE SCREEN WOULD FREEZE. I WOULD THEN NEED TO TURN OFF THE VEHICLE AND TAKE THE KEY OUT OF THE IGNITION TO SORT OF RESET BUT NOW THAT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE BC THE SCREEN IS BLACK AND THE RADIO ONLY WORKS. THE CAMERAS DO NOT WORK EITHER.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2016 FORD ESCAPE. WHILE DRIVING 20 MPH, THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO HESITATE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE TRANSMISSION GEAR MALFUNCTION WARNING INDICATOR ILLUMINATED.

BOUGHT NEW TIRES AT 44,500 MILES (MUSH SOONER THAN EXPECTED ) AND INSTALLER COULD NOT REMOVE LUGS AS THEY WERE "SWOLLEN". WENT TO SAM PACK FORD, LEWISVILLE, TX WHERE I BOUGHT VEHICLE. WAS TOLD BY SERVICE  ADVISORS "SWOLLEN" LUG NUTS WERE A KNOWN ISSUE AND THE DEALERS USED SPECIAL 19 1/2 METRIC SOCKETS TO REMOVE THEM.  THEY TOLD ME IT COST $10.00 PER LUG TO REPLACE WITH FORD ORIGINAL LUGS OR THEY WOULD SELL ME AN AFTER MARKET SET FOR $50 AND I HAD TO PAY TO HAVE "SWOLLEN" LUGS REMOVED AND NEW ONES RESTORED.  THEY REITERATED FORD AND ALL DEALERS WERE WELL AWARE OF THE ISSUE BUT FORD CONTINUES TO INSTALL THE PROBLEM LUGS ON NEW VEHICLES.

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2016 FORD ESCAPE. WHEN IT RAINED, AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF WATER ENTERED THE VEHICLE. THE WATER POURED INTO THE VEHICLE FROM THE PASSENGER AND DRIVER SIDE WINDOWS. THE FAILURE CAUSED THE INSIDE OF THE VEHICLE TO BECOME DRENCHED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 500.  UPDATED 12/21/16*LJ
IN FOLLOW UP TO MY ORIGINAL  COMPLAINT NUMBER 10885168, STEERING ASSIST MALFUNCTION WHILE OPERATING ON THE MASSACHUSETTS TURNPIKE, WHICH RESULTED IN A LOSS OF POWER STEERING, THE DEALERSHIP CONFIRMED THE VEHICLE NEEDS A NEW STEERING RACK AT 2500 MILES.
We started to notice a rough idle when starting the vehicle, the check engine light came on. The rough idle continued to get worse. We took it to a Certified Mechanic to have it inspected.  Based upon the check engine status, they did further diagnosis through various tests. They determined that the coolant appeared to be seeping into the #1 cylinder. They checked the Ford website for any recalls and found a TSB ( Technical Service Bulletin} # 19-2346 regarding the 2.0L Eco-Boost engine. Ford's TSP says to replace the engine block, but does not indicate at who's expense.  If this is defective and Ford knows, the consumer should not be responsible to pay for this major expense. What do we do? Within the ;next couple weeks we plan to take the car into a Ford Dealership to do their own diagnosis.
In 2021 my engine was replaced by the dealership I purchased it from, with a manufacturer made engine. The issue was that the coolant was leaking into the cylinders causing the engine to overheat which is a potential risk of fires. It was under warranty for 5 years or 50K miles whichever came first.   Today, I was notified by the dealership that my engine needs to be replaced AGAIN for the SAME ISSUE as 4 years ago. Coolant leaking into cylinder causing misfire. I was charged $1400 for repairs that DID NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE ISSUES.   Ford is now telling me there is nothing they can do for me and my car is safe to drive so long as I keep it filled with coolant.
Check engine light came on, Ford Dealership told me I need to have the engine replaced at my cost $10,000  I am the second owner and it only has 45,000 miles  Please help!
Frequently (not all the time) the motor would shake after filling with the gas in tank when I start the engine and it stops pumping. So It needs to be turned back on and have to use the gas pedal to keep it running during neutral mode. Something is not right. It has to do with fuel pump system issue and engine light would be on when the problem comes.
On or about 16 June 2025, a misfire prompted me to have the problem investigated. The computer showed a misfire on #1 cylinder; however, the problem cleared within two days. Then, the engine overheated. I filled the antifreeze tank, and the heat was reduced immediately. However, it recurred the next day, prompting me to have it investigated by our local dealer. They found it to be a leaking of coolant into the cylinder. I researched this problem and have learned it to be a common problem with 2015 - 2019 2.0L Ecoboost engines, of which my vehicle is one. Further research revealed that Ford was aware of this problem, had recalled several vehicles to address it, and had even extended the warranty to 10 years or 150,000 miles, whichever came first. However, I have been informed this is done by "VIN" and only a few are selected. I am upset that my engine is NOT included in this, as it is a 2.0L Ecoboost, just like the others. If Ford knew this problem, regardless of manufacture, why would my engine NOT be included? I cannot afford this cost on top of the $17,300 I owe for the car!
What component or system failed or malfunctioned, and is it available for inspection upon request? The component that failed is the engine cooling system, specifically due to a known issue with coolant intrusion into the short block. This failure led to significant engine damage in my son’s 2018 Ford Escape. The vehicle is currently available for inspection upon request.  How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk? The sudden engine failure posed a serious safety risk. If the vehicle had stalled while in motion—particularly on a highway or in heavy traffic—it could have led to a collision or left the driver stranded in a hazardous location. In this case, my son's car failed unexpectedly, which could have resulted in harm had the conditions been different.  Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? Yes, the issue has been confirmed by a certified service technician. It matches a known problem in 2018 Ford Escapes involving coolant leaking into the engine block, which has been documented in Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) issued by Ford.  Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives, or others? At this time, the vehicle has not been inspected by the manufacturer, police, or insurance representatives. However, the diagnosis and confirmation of coolant intrusion was made by a mechanic.  Were there any warning lamps, messages, or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear? No. Only engine coolant container was empty without warning.
The contact owns a 2018 Ford Escape. The contact stated that while driving at an undisclosed speed, several unknown warning lights illuminated. The contact was able to pull over to the shoulder of the road and restart the vehicle; however, the failure persisted. The vehicle was taken to a local independent mechanic, where it was diagnosed with DTC: P0012. The vehicle was taken to another independent service center, where it was diagnosed and DTC: P0014, P1299, P0012, and P04DB were retrieved. The local dealer was contacted and related the failure to Customer Satisfaction Program: 19B37. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 146,318.
There was a coolant intrusion into engine and mixing with oil causing check engine light to come on. There is a memo from Ford that if this happens the only repair would be to replace the engine motor assembly with all hardware (for the cost of $9, 467.88).  The safety of myself and others was put at risk because the engine experienced sudden performance issues due to coolant mixing with the oil. These symptoms could have led to a complete engine failure, especially at highway speeds or in heavy traffic, which creates a serious risk of accidents. Additionally, the potential for internal engine damage raises the risk of a fire, as documented in similar cases involving EcoBoost engines. I was driving a vehicle that could unpredictably stall or become inoperable, putting both me and other drivers in dangerous situations.  The Willowbrook Ford Dealer diagnosed the problem on 6/13/25 after running diagnostics.  The engine light came on on 6/11/25.

From what I understand, the engine malfunctioned in a way that caused the cylinder compression to fail in several cylinders, but not all. This caused the car to stutter, shake, and slow down significantly in traffic on the highway. A warning popped up on the dashboard that said to shut the car down as soon as possible. We pulled over right away, which left us on a bridge on the highway. This endangered us as well as passing traffic, and then the tow truck person as well. We had to have the entire engine replaced in the car, which then after about 25 miles of driving, had the exact same problem (thankfully, in a 25 mph neighborhood this time). The problem has been replicated by the service center several times. They have now installed a total of three replacement engines that were all defective.

I received a warning on my dashboard to pullover safely because my engine was overheating even though I just left work from a cold start. I had it towed to  my mechanic who told me I  had a serious issue and recommended I take it to Ford. Ford just confirmed a short engine block issue and even though I had the required repair done on 7/9/22 that was supposed to prevent this more expensive issue.  My particular vehicle was not on the Program 21N12 Coolant Intrusion Recall for possible short engine block issue but that's the exact issues the dealership just told me has happened to my vehicle. Luckily I was able to maneuver it out of the line of traffic safely.
Widely known issue that the engine has coolant leaking into the engine. Ford issued a statement on it. Now the same thing is happening to my car.   Safety of myself and others put at risk by vehicle running incorrectly and engine is now misfiring resulting in difficulty maintaining power while driving.   Problem has been confirmed by independent body shop and is being confirmed but dealer now.   Check engine light was on at 97k and now at 106k with same codes.
this car had an engine light go off and there was a cylinder 2 misfire.  When I brought it into the dealership they said that there is a known issue that the coolant is intruding into the motor. Ford knows about this as a problem and has a faulty design and avoided telling people about it. I only realized the thousands of people who are being put at risk of the engine blowing while driving it down the road. My car was not the only one at the dealership with the same exact problem. These cars need to be recalled and corrected

The engine isn’t working. Took to Ford Dealership in Selma, Alabama and they told us it will cost 10k to fix the car and I still owe 15K for the car. It started out not cranking. It is not safe for a woman to be in a car and not crank to get me home back and forth to work everyday. I have only had the car for 4 years. The warning lamp came in for me on Monday, June 5th, 2023 and  at that time my husband immediately got it to the Ford Dealership on Thursday of that week so he could get a dolly to take it there. The car is at the dealership in Selma right now. We don’t have an invoice yet. Paying 10k for a new engine is almost paying the car off on what I owe on it. My husband is trying to find someone else to look at the car at a reasonable cost. Hope you can help. This has put me out of a car.

The 2019 Ford Escape (purchased new in December 2018) was taken to the Nick Mayer Ford (Mayfield Heights, Ohio where it was purchased) service department in August/September 2024 for a computer diagnostic analysis for a previous warranty recall/repair problems regarding short block replacement for coolant intrusion that was not performed/corrected several years prior in 2021 when only the turbocharger was replaced. The problem was excessive smoke being emitted at engine start back in 2021 when the only turbocharger was replaced and the problem reappeared in August 2024. Nick Mayer Ford had the vehicle for two weeks in August/September 2024 and provided neither a computer diagnostic analysis report nor repair of the previous recall/repair issues (2021) including no explanation/resolution of the problem. Currently, due to the previous undiagnosed/unresolved problems, the engine failed at 70,000 miles in December 2024 and the long engine block has to be replaced. The engine warning lamp was on at the time of engine failure. We are still paying on a car loan for the vehicle.  References:  1. Ford Help Desk Assistance Claim Case# [XXX] on 12/5/2024 filed with Tanya E. for  short block replacement for coolant intrusion.  2. Ohio Attorney General Matter Number [XXX] on 12/6/2024 filed with Ross.  3. Ohio Attorney General Consumer Complaint# [XXX] filed online on 1/3/2025.
The contact owns a 2019 Ford Escape. The contact stated when the vehicle was started, the check engine warning light illuminated. The contact stated that the failure had occurred while returning home from visiting a nearby town. The vehicle was driven to the residence. The following day, the vehicle was taken to the dealer where it was diagnosed with head gasket failure, coolant intrusion into the engine, and engine failure. The contact was informed that the engine needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The contact was advised to contact the NHTSA Hotline and report the failure. In addition, the contact was informed that the repair was not covered under the Customer Satisfaction Program: 21N12. The failure mileage was approximately 68,000.
My check engine light first came on in June 2024 (3 months ago), and said there were too many cylinder 4 misfires, and to replace the spark plugs. This was done, check engine light was cleared. My car began showing an "engine fault, service now" error 2.5 weeks ago and it sounded like water was "rushing" in the engine. The check engine light came on 3 days later, got the codes read, took it to a mechanic, then exchanged the ignition coil. When I went to pick it up, the car shuddered whenever trying to accelerate, so much so that my car wouldn't accelerate, and I had to have to towed to the Ford dealer. The mechanic confirmed that with the codes and the symptoms, and he previously worked at Ford, there is a coolant leak into the engine block and I would likely need a new engine. There is a Technical Service Bulletin out for this issue, so they know it exists. The dealer has not confirmed the issue yet, they said it will probably take 2 weeks before they get to that, then it would likely be 1-3 months to get the parts here, then they would start repairing it, but there were 3 vehicles ahead of mine with the exact same issue. My safety was put at risk because the car would not accelerate to the speed limit, increasing likelihood of a wreck, and the engine felt like it was going to die at any moment when I returned the one block back to the mechanic.
Noticed vehicle was admitting black and grey smoke on cold start.  Took vehicle to local automotive service center.  They conducted a Level 1 Test - leak down testing.  They found that coolant was infiltrating the engine.  The cylinders are showing scoring.  The repair would consist of replacing the engine at a cost of $13,000.  This is apparently a known defect for this engine.
- engine severely lost power  - if I didn’t get off the road in time could’ve possibly created a big car accident  -took my car to 2 independent car shops and one have confirmed the problem  - no the car has not been inspected by anyone but the service center. If have to it will be done  -the only warning was the check engine light which isn’t much of a warning if the problem is already present  Anti-Freeze coolant leaks into a cylinder randomly. Caused the engine to stall out immediately on the freeway.
Vehicle started to idle oddly on startup. Then a few days later it started to vibrate or cavitate. Check engine light came on. Scheduled for service. Service as of today 05/31/2024, coolant has leaked into engine, engine needs replaced according to service provider. Brought this issue up in 2022 to service after seeing the NHTSA customer service bulletin. My mfr date was out of the listed date range so nothing was done or checked.

THE VEHICLE WILL OCCASIONALLY LOCK AND UNLOCK ITSELF AS IT IS BEING DRIVEN. AS IT LOCKS AND UNLOCKS ITSELF, IT BRIEFLY ACTIVATES THE HAZARD LIGHTS AS WELL. THE VEHICLE IS KEYLESS IGNITION, AND THE KEY FOB IS PLACED IN THE CENTER CONSOLE AREA WITH NOTHING CONTACTING IT. WHEN IT OCCURS, IT IS QUITE FREQUENT, AND SEEMS TO NOT BE AFFECTED BY MOISTURE, SPEED OR TEMPERATURE, NOR BY CITY OR HIGHWAY DRIVING.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2019 FORD ESCAPE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING AT LOW SPEEDS, THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY SURGED FORWARD TO THE RIGHT AND CRASHED INTO A UTILITY POLE.

THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURES. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 500.  *JS
INTERMITTENT ISSUES WITH THE TRANSMISSION NOT BEING ABLE TO SHIFT INTO PARK.  WHEN IT HAPPENS, THE SHIFTIER FREELY MOVES BETWEEN ALL POSITIONS EXCEPT WILL NOT GO ALL THE WAY FORWARD TO THE "PARK" POSITION.  IT CAN EVENTUALLY BE MOVED FORWARD BY FIDDLING WITH IT OR ONE TIME A PASSENGER WAS ABLE TO FORCE IT.  EVEN WHEN THIS IS DONE, THE INDICATOR IN THE INSTRUMENT PANEL DOES NOT ALWAYS SHOW A GEAR SELECTED SO IN THOSE CASES, IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER IT IS TRULY IN PARK.
Vehicle has active alerts for powertrain control module, and low boost pressure with the turbocharge along with emissions codes P0299, P0496 and P0456. The vehicle is constantly going into deep sleep mode. While driving the vehicle started to enter safe mode. And displayed an alert that said please turn ignition on. The dash and screen went black like vehicle was off but it was still running. This happened multiple times. My vehicle also will not start after pumping gas so I have to leave vehicle running every time I pump gas. My vehicle will not pass NY state inspection because of the recalls.
My key fob stopped working due to BCM not being able to communicate.
My vehicle had been driving great up till about three or four months ago. It started losing speed, stalling and would not accelerate unless i pressed the pedal to the floor which I had to do in order to avoid an accident. All while this was happening the service light with the  would comes on, but once I cut the car off and started it up again the next day or after running multiple errands the service light would be gone and my car would drive normal so I thought it was just a fluke and I didn’t worry about it again. Until now!!! Just today my car would not start and at the same time I would also get a warning saying, start the car or cut the engine off as I was trying to start the car so that was crazy. And in order to get it started I had to get the battery jumped, after that it would start right up. But later if I tried starting the car up again it would barley start up without multiple attempts of me pressing the push start, and pressing down hard on the brake pedal and to top it all off my car is losing speed and stalling again.. So because of this I had the battery, terminals, starter, and alternator tested and they said everything is fine so none of that is causing my car not to start up. While trying to find a solution and get a estimate on repairs, I found out my car model has three recalls on it but from what I can see non of these recalls should cause any of these issues. Still I made a appointment to drop it off tomorrow so they can fix the recalls and hopefully figure out what the problem is and fix these other issues. Any who, I thought I should share this just in case others are having these problems and maybe Ford will correct these hazards. Thank you.

The door hinge's weld came off. All of the sudden the door was making noises when opening and closing. When finally, it wouldn't close at all.  I was looking on what was wrong and the door hinge wasn't welded on the door and it shows 3 dots where the welding broke off.
The door has separated and will not close properly. I’m concerned the door could potentially open while in operation. My wife should not have to climb through the passenger side of the car to drive somewhere because the driver door has come apart.
Drivers side door weld problem that could cause drivers side door to come open.   My drivers side front door makes a creaky sound when I open it.  It seems the internal weld to the door has failed. During my research to determine, if this was a national concern, I read internet articles stating this appears to be a faulty spot weld in the Drivers' side door check arm.  For me, this started on [XXX], 2024.  I reported the issue, to my local Ford Dealerships auto repair department, Gary Crossley Ford, Kansas City, Missouri on Friday, [XXX].  It told me Ford had not notified it of a recall, nor has it provided repair instructions.   I spoke to Jennifer in Houston, TX, at the Customer Support Line 1.800.392.3673 on Friday, [XXX].  She stated parts and repair instructions were available and she was placing an order for them while, we spoke.  This turned out to be false information, given the above stated information and Gary Crossley's auto repair department confirming on [XXX], 2024, it did not have the parts, nor did it have Ford how to repair instructions. INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
Ford service center diagnosed a failed AWD module. It was only examined by the Ford techs at the dealership where I bought it. Total price was approx $1200 which was covered by extended warranty plan, but I had to pay a $250 deductible. The mileage when the warning illuminated was approx 38,900. While driving, AWD OFF was illuminated on dash. As well as POWERTRAIN FAULT, HILL START ASSIST OFF, PRE-COLLISION ASSIST UNAVAILABLE, SERVICE ADVANCETRAC, AND SEE MANUAL. I was put at risk because all of my safety features seemed to be failing. I have heard many others having the same issue all with low miles.(40,000 or less) I believe this component requires a recall because I had only owned the car 3 weeks when this happened. I havent even made a payment on it yet!!
The contact owns a 2020 Ford Escape. The contact stated that while opening and closing the front driver’s side door, there was a popping and cracking sound coming from the door panel. Additionally, sometimes the front driver's side door was difficult to open and close. The cause of the failure was not yet determined. The manufacturer and local dealer were notified of the failure. The failure mileage was 35,000.
The contact owns a 2020 Ford Escape.

The driver's side door hinge has broken. I can't open the door wide or it won't shut. The gentleman at the dealership said it may need welding. Whatever has happened is affecting the operation of that door's window as well. I have read that there have been complaints/concerns of this from others yet no recall has been considered.
My 2020 Ford Escape Hybrid SE driver's side door has failed (ripped) spot welds at the door's arm. I simply opened my car door one day, and heard a loud pop. Ever since I simply opened my car door, my door now has constant cracking/popping sounds when I open or close my driver's side door. Due to issues with my door, my driver's side window now does not move up or down. This issue did not have any warning or symptoms prior to the ripped weld spots, it was a random instance which now permanently has affected my car. I have done some investigating on my own regarding this matter with other Ford Escape owners, and this is a very common issue with this make and model. Some owners that had similar issues with their vehicle stated that their driver's side door flew off when traveling at highway speeds. Due to the previously stated sentence, this is a huge safety concern as a door flying off my vehicle could affect other drivers and put them at risk of injury. I took my vehicle into an auto shop to be diagnosed, who recommended that I take my vehicle into a Ford dealership to deal with this problem directly. The Ford dealership had me call Ford's Customer Service line to discuss my options. Ford's customer service informed me that their is nothing that FMC can do to assist with this matter and that I do not qualify for any financial assistance to cover the cost of this repair. I have been in contact with my Ford dealership who told me that the whole door will need to be replaced, and that this repair will cost a minimum of $3,000. Due to not having any other way of getting to and from work, I have to drive my unsafe vehicle for transportation. There is currently a TSB on this specific issue, but Ford is refusing to consider this matter a "recall".

The following day, the contact stated that upon entering the vehicle, he found that the driver's side door was unable to latch closed and required an excessive amount of force to securely close the door. As a result, the door hinge detached from the vehicle. The vehicle was not taken to the dealer or an independent mechanic. The vehicle was not repaired. After investigating the failure, the contact related the failure to NHTSA Action Number: PE23013 (Structure). The manufacturer was notified of the failure but provided no assistance. The failure mileage was 80,000.

There was no warning light illuminated. The vehicle was taken to the dealer, where the electronic selectable one-way clutch (SOWC), was replaced; however, the failure recurred. The vehicle was taken to a second dealer, Schicker Ford of St. Louis (3300 S Kingshighway Blvd, St. Louis, MO 63139) where the electronic selectable one-way clutch (SOWC) was replaced a second time; however, the failure persisted. The vehicle was taken back to the second dealer, where it was determined that the transmission needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure, but no assistance was provided. The failure mileage was approximately 52,189.
Door hinge on 2020 Ford Escape has failed. The window no longer works, the door is difficult to open and close, sometimes it will not open or close. It makes a loud popping noise when opened or closed.
I was driving home in my 2020 Escape Hybrid, a 2 1/2 hour trip. All of a sudden, 40 miles from home and as I was driving on a busy expressway just before nightfall, my info screen and the main screen went black. The info screen said there was a connectivity error. I had no idea what was going on, but I was terrified that my headlights would go out. Luckily, there was an exit coming up, and I took it and parked at the gas station right off the exit. I called AAA for a tow. They had to put the car on a flatbed truck, as once I had turned the car off it wouldn’t start again, so I couldn’t put it into neutral. I got towed home, as the dealership was closed; and the next morning I got towed to the dealership. I was told by the service advisor that the battery had a bad cell. Since this was the second battery that died within a year, the dealership replaced it for free.   I’m on a Ford Escape Hybrid forum, and there are many people who have had the same problem with the 12 volt battery. It was suggested to replace the battery with a larger AGM battery.   I was lucky there was an exit right there. If I had driven the car any longer, I probably would have lost my headlights and the whole car would have died. And I could have been killed. This is a life-threatening issue that Ford should fix by replacing the battery with a larger one that has enough power to run the car and thus won’t fail prematurely. I’m scared to drive my car now.
Door check bracket is popping/clicking as I close & open my drivers side door. Also the window can only roll down 25% of the way now because of the bracket failure
The contact owns a 2020 Ford Escape. The contact stated while opening and closing the front driver's side door, there was an abnormal popping sound coming from the door as if the door hinge was fracturing. The contact had taken the vehicle to a local dealer, where it was diagnosed and determined that the driver's side door needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was informed of the failure. The contact had researched online and related the failure to NHTSA Action Number: PE23013 (Structure). The failure mileage was approximately 26,000.
Nothing has yet happened, however, Ford sent a recall notice regarding premature engine failure in May 2023. The recall (NHTSA recall 23V380) stated that they anticipated a solution by October 2023, but they have no solution still. I don't know what the nature of the defect is, but I did not anticipate waiting more than 8 months for a solution on something that could cause the engine to set on fire. This vehicle is a daily driver for us, and we'd like to take it on a road trip this summer, but the combination of heat and unknown engine risk makes me not want to risk it.
Cracked broken well spots on front left door (driver door) at the check arm attach attachment points in door assembly. Prevent driver window from opening or closing.
Driver side door suddenly began making loud creaking and popping noise when opening and closing. The driver side window also will not let all the way down since the noises started. Took it to the Ford dealership advised it was the door check assembly that was broke and they order the part. Took it to a 3rd party to have it put on and they advised that there was a failure with the spot welds in the check arm bracket on the the front door. Bracket has pulled out of the front driver's side door. Also advised this is why the window will only let down a little bit. Call the dealership and they advised that the door panel was not taken off so they would of not been able to see the spot welds provided Ford Company# called and stated that they was not a warranty on the vehicle and that there was nothing they could do at this time and provided case# CXH01214372. The cheapest estimate I have received so far to fix this issue is approximately 2,200.00 which I do not have please issue a recall on this issue
Front left drivers door hinge check arm attachment welds have broken causing a terrible noise and making it hard to close the door. It hasn't been reproduced or confirmed yet by a dealer or independent service center as I just now figured out what the noise was and it's getting worse every time the door is used. Hasn't been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others, I came here first just now. No warnings or messages, just a terrible sound that was hard to pinpoint what was causing it until I saw the spot welds move away from the door when it opened. But now it is hard to close the door.
My driver side door began to make a popping sound and was hard to open and shut.  Now it feels like the door will fall off or open while driving and has caused the window to no longer roll down.  The Ford dealership (Bob Tomes) has acknowledged the problem and the same problem with other same year models but will not take care of the issue unless I pay full price out of pocket.
Unable to get an E-Check, emissions test. Getting Gateway error. Found on [XXX]  that others are also unable to get their SUV's E-checked to get a registration sticker. Ford is possibly aware of this. Found SSM [XXX] and SSM [XXX] , "Some 2020-2021 Escape/Corsair and 2021 Bronco Sport vehicles may exhibit a communication fault with emissions inspection equipment. This may be due to the software in the gateway module. To correct this condition, reprogram the gateway module to latest software level using the appropriate Ford diagnostic scan tool. Use causal part 14F642 and applicable labor times from Section 10 of the Service Labor Time Standards (SLTS) Manual." Yet they are not doing anything about it. I called my local ford dealer and they weren't aware of any of these and want me to pay for the reprogramming. If this fault is inherent in the product line, it should be a recall. I wanted you to know about this. No warning lamps, I went to 2 different county E-Check inspection places and tried several different connections and even tried the self serve kiosk. I could not get the e check completed as their equipment would not communicate with the Ford OBD-II Port. This affects all owners of the product years 2020-2021 for Ford Escape and Broncos. My dealer is not at fault and offered to reprogram my vehicle at no charge, so i commend them.  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)

The drivers door started making a popping noise when opened and then the welds on the door broke. Drivers side window would not go down.
The driver door panel is not welded properly which cause the door to crack when you open it and the arm of the door is broke. I took the vehicle to the shop and they stated that it a welding problem with Ford my issues and now I have to pay for the door. I feel ford need to recall the vehicle and fix the issue free of charge
The driver side door started making a loud click on Saturday 10-14-2023. By Monday the 16th I could not open the window. I took it to the Ford dealership and when the service tech tried to close the door it would not close.

Ford escape brakes have been a continuous issue after purchasing car 3 years ago. Brakes would make loud screeching noise when reversing car slowly. The problem seemed to get worse after it rained or the car gets wet. I’ve taken the car into the Ford dealer 3x for the same issue and they cannot seem to recreate the noise. Dealer has said the brake pads look fine. Recently, when applying brakes the car isn’t slowing down but still moving forward. After about 10seconds of “skipping” forward the car will stop.

The dial shifter gets stuck/ locked in position (Park) when overly hot outside. Takes significant time to cool car and release.
My Escape has just over 41,000 miles. Very well taken care of and after sitting in a personal garage, while on vacation, I opened drivers side door and LOUD popping noise began when opening or closing. I took to dealership where I lease from and was informed door stop is broken and only way to fixe is total door replacement. This would need to be at my own cost, I REFUSE TO PAY SINCE I DID NOTHING TO IT, and I exchange in 7 months. This is freaking ridiculous. I can now not use my window and literally am anxious to use my only care to get to and from work. They need to fix!!
The door limiter is ripped free of its mounting [inside the door] and makes keeping the door closed and/or opening it impossible at times.  In addition, the broken pieces in the door damaged the window regulator, making egress through the window equally impossible.  Our safety is put at risk due to the possibility of the door opening while driving as well as the safety of oncoming traffic.  Both Ford dealer and independent body shop confirmed that they have seen this problem on many other Ford vehicles, and the only remedy is a complete door replacement.  Prior to door failure, there was a lot of creaking and difficulty closing the door.  When we first bought the car [new], the door was not closing correctly, and the dealer claimed that the weatherstripping was the issue.  Now that the car is OUT of warranty, Dealer mechanic confirmed this door limiter breaking from the spot welds is a common occurance, yet not yet under recall for my VIN number.
My main car display is dying and it’s also my way into the car, diagnostic reporting and navigation. Navigating is harder with out main display freezing or not working at all. Also my blind spot sensor goes off at random times in which nobody had a answer for me on a fix for that.
Driving vehicle and AWD became disabled, received a major power train fault, and pre collision system disabled as well as other safety issues. Took to ford dealer and they said it was the AWD control module that caused the faults but this was not covered under powertrain warranty. There was a customer service program for this for 2020 escapes but my vin was not covered. It is identified as a powertrain fault so how is that not covered under powertrain warranty.
Transmission becomes unresponsive and unreliable in high temps and locks into whatever gear it was in IE if left in the sun in park the shifter won’t budge until enough time for it to cool down has passed
The contact owns a 2020 Ford Escape. The contact stated that the check arm attachment points were fractured on the front driver's side door. The front driver's side door made an abnormally loud sound while being opened. The dealer was made aware of the failure; however, the vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The dealer confirmed that there was no recall associated with the VIN. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 39,000.
The contact owns a 2020 Ford Escape. The contact stated while opening the front driver’s side door the contact felt the door falling off the hinge. When the contact entered the vehicle and attempted to roll down the window, the window failed to roll down. The vehicle was taken to the dealer and stated that the front driver’s side door was defective and needed to be repaired. The vehicle was repaired. On another occasion while opening the front passenger’s side door, the contact heard a popping sound coming from the door. The vehicle was taken to the dealer again and the contact stated the that the door was defective, and that the door needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was contacted and stated that a half of the repair cost would be covered. A case was filed. The failure mileage was 38,000.
The check arm door makes a strong creaking/cracking sound as the door is opened and closed. This is believed to be due to cracked spot welds in the check arm assembly. It creates an inability to roll down the window all day and I fear further damage if this is unable to be fixed through a recall.
I have been the only driver/owner since May of 2020. Vehicle has not been in any type of accident.  2020 Ford Escape has approximately 18,000 miles. I did purchase (bumper to bumper) warranty. Vehicle is scheduled for service on July 10, 2023. Ford dealerships are understaffed and can only service vehicles on urgency of issue or issues. July date was soonest and was from the 3rd Ford dealership I called.  Issues started on May 13, 2023. While vehicle is parked and while it’s being driven, the following warnings occur: •AWD Off •AWD Service Required •Powertrain Malfunction •Powertrain Service Required •Pre-collision Assist Not Available •Service Advance Trac •See Manual •Passenger window opens/closes on its own  When vehicle is in park: •Power Lift-gate opens halfway or does not open •Doors unlock and lock on their own
The welds securing the check arm on driver's side door detached without prior warning during normal use, making the door nearly impossible to close fully, and keeping the window from going down more than about an inch.  The dealer says they have seen multiple instances of this on the 2020 Escape, and there are many reports of the same thing on the internet.  The body shop that repaired it has also seen it many times, always with the 2020 model.  Ford appears to have strengthened it in subsequent model, but hasn't issued a recall and won't cover the cost the repair.  Obviously, having a door (or even a window) that doesn't operate well, especially on the driver's side, is a safety issue.  This detached check arm also allowed the door to swing out uncontrollably if caught by the wind or on a downhill slope, which could damage other cars in a parking lot.
The contact owns 2020 Ford Escape. The contact stated that while parked, the driver's side door stopper made an abnormal sound and the door failed to close or open as needed.

I went to get in my car one day and my door was making a popping noise. I took a closer look and my door check strap unwelded from my car door.
November 18, 2022 had my car for 22 months when I took it for oil change I reported a noise when turning the steering wheel.  Ford mechanics decided it the front shocks.  Part # LX6Z18124EQ was ordered at that time.   As of today 3/8/2023 it is still on back order.  The noise is getting louder.   I have been in contact with Ford which has expedited the part about 3 - 4 weeks ago.  Still not at dealership.   I have never had so much problems with a new car.  Ford denied the buy back or lemon law for FL stating it was after the 24 month warranty which is false.   I’m wondering what else can I do if anything.

Front passenger door began making loud snapping noise when closing or opening.  Window was affected, would only go down halfway and required manual assist to close.  Took to dealer, repair not covered by warranty.  Told spotwelds at door check were busted.  I had the spotwelds replaced on 12-29-22.  It was quite expensive and didn't seem this should happen in a car only 2 years old..
On June7th I was driving home in my 2020 hybrid escape when the motor quit and the car came to a stop, then smoke started coming out from under the hood, I opened the hood and flames shot out at the back side of the motor on the passenger side, oil was leaking on to the road and on fire, I called the fire department, when they got there all the fire finally went out as the oil burned up. I had the car towed that day to Purchase ford in Mayfield KY. where it is still at. At first I was told this would be a warranty covered job, the car had 37500 miles, the power train and motor are good for 60,000 miles. It was apparent this would take a long time to fix, and I told Ford I did not want the car back as it would be depleted in value with a history of a fire, In July I got a recall 22V484 for the very reason my car caught on fire. Come to find out the motor failed and thru a rod and a hole in the block let the oil leak out and catch on fire. I asked for a loaner but they did not have one, I rented a car and Ford finally paid for most of it but I'm still out $500.00, I have returned the rental car. I have made five months of payment on this car without having it. At first Ford said they would do a buy back, then they emailed me saying this was denied  due to KY. guidelines? I also asked for another car of equal value and that will not happen. Finally Ford told me to accept the repairs on my car and take it back or they were closing my case. My case # is [XXX], my contact was customer service rep . [XXX]. The car has a value of about $25000.00 if it had not caught on fire. I feel Ford should reimburse me for my payments or give me another car of equal value or make up the difference I will lose if I take the car back. I also think they should provide me a loaner while my car is being fixed.  Thank You [XXX]  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).
Passenger mirror blind spot indicator randomly comes on. Just purchased, so I have not taken the vehicle to the Ford dealership. The driver side functions properly.

My back passenger door will not lock. If I lock it from my ford app or key fob that back door stays unlocked. This puts my safety at risk because I’m a young female living in a big city known for sex trafficking. I could be followed to my car and I could lock the door but that door stays unlocked someone could kidnap me. Or what if I’m driving the car and the door flies open, that can cause a deadly accident. There was no warning signs or messages just a mere coincidence that I noticed it wasn’t locking. We took it into ford and they have found the issue but don’t want to cover it even though we pay for the primary care. I noticed that past models have been recalled for this issue and should be recalled again that this is something that should not be taken lightly. A lock on a door is not wear and tear when it doesn’t get used.

I have had multiple issues with the powertrain warning light illuminating. The first time it was decided to be low/dirty oil. This occurred about a month after purchasing the vehicle in 2021 with about 4000 miles. The second time it occurred about 6 months later. The dealer could not find a code nor replicate the issue. We thought I had bought bad gas. A year later it came on again, Ford dealership again couldn’t replicate the issue. Finally it came on and stayed on and throttle position sensor was replaced in July 2022. Light came on again in November 2024. Auto parts store and dealership could not find a code. This time I had no coolant. Added coolant and it has not come back on again.

Safety Recall Notice 23S27 - Engine Failure - How does UPDATING THE POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE fix an internal engine manufacturing problem?    Does this correct the internal engine manufacturing issue with these vehicles?   Or is this just a fire prevention issue?  This fix seems similar to the previous fix of drilling holes in the pan under the engine to allow the leaking oil to drain out, thereby preventing a fire.   This fix appears to be a band-aid to avoid correcting the original engine manufacturing issue by forcing the engine to shut down before the oil leaks out.     Recall Reference Number: 22S47 Isolated engine manufacturing issues have resulted in engine failures involving engine block or oil pan breach on certain 2020—2023 Ford Escape and 2022—2023 Maverick vehicles with 2.5L HEV/PHEV engines. In the event of an engine block or oil pan breach, the HEV/PHEV system continues to propel the vehicle allowing the customer to continue to drive the vehicle. As the customer continues to drive after a block breach, oil and/or fuel vapor continues to be expelled and accumulates near ignition sources primarily expected to be the exhaust system.  This recall appears to be a way for Ford to avoid fixing these engine issues permanently.  I mostly drive locally (2021 Ford Escape with 17,500 miles) because I don't want to get stuck on an interstate highway 500 miles from home.   I have seen no documentation on how this helps owners feels safe when traveling away from home.

Started the vehicle and turned the defroster on high setting one morning to defrost the windshield with heavy frost. Car had been running about 3-4 minutes and I heard a cracking sound. I noticed a 12" crack in the middle of the windshield when the frost was melted off.  The car was still parked when the windshield cracked and was not being driven due to visibility being limited by frost.
The car smells like gas on the inside.  Ford says no codes so no issue.  Started when 15000 miles on ur and ur still smells like gas with 21000 miles on it.  Ford can’t seem to find the issue after being in shop 3 weeks.

I don't do much interstate/expressway driving but after an 80 mile trip yesterday, my ears last night had tinnitus hiss and it continues today, The sound inside the car was a continuous loud medium high-pitched sound. This vehicle's engine is noisy as you pick up speed but not unacceptable. This sound was eminating from the road and amplified through the vehicle chassis and interior driving chamber and easily cancelled out any noise coming from the engine compartment. This sound was high enough that a horn or siren could be canceled out unless right on a tight perimeter of the car.
The contact owns a 2022 Ford Escape. The contact stated that while driving approximately 50 MPH, the vehicle started losing power. The contact stated that a notification from the Ford mobile app indicated that there was a power train malfunction, reduction in power, Four-wheel Drive fault, and advised to contact an authorized dealer.

The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired by a dealer or an independent mechanic. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 23,000.

We were driving on the interstate and the car began to make a metallic clicking/ticking sound. We started to move to the shoulder as we thought it might be a tire issue when we saw an orange glow reflected on the concrete. As soon as we reached the shoulder the engine started pouring out smoke and we immediately left the car. We opened the hood and saw fire inside the engine compartment. We left the hood up and moved away from the car and called 911. It appears this issue is tied to a known, open recall for which Ford has not released any information on how to fix with no specific timeline in place to release the fix.  Our safety was at risk as the car was on fire and we were standing on the side of an interstate at midnight not knowing if the fire was going to go out or the car was going to explode; luckily for us it went out. The vehicle is currently at a Ford dealership for inspection. There was an engine service warning immediately before we heard the clicking noise but that is the first notification of any issue.

There is an issue with the brakes and brake dust covers the wheel.   The brakes have been squealing when pressed since the vehicle was leased.  Each time I inquired at the dealership I was told it was because the brakes were new.  Since they brakes continued to squeal after months, I asked service to look at them for me.  They did, and said everything looked fine.  As of now the front driver side wheel is completely covered in a black substance.  Possibly brake dust and the brakes still squeal.  I am concerned about the safety of my brakes.  I took photos and sent them to my dealership today. This has been on ongoing problem since day one.
The issue I'm having is the traction light is on and my rear break lights stay on constantly. I took the car to a shop and had the break light switch replaced. Two days later the lights was back on. I did some research and there was a  recall for the exact issue I'm have (NHTSA14V252)  when I gave the Chevrolet dealership my VIN they said there were no recalls but there was three recalls but they are no longer open.  Is there any thing I can do? Please help

THE BRAKES ARE DOING THE SAME THING THAT WAS RECALLED AND REPAIRED BACK IN 2014. THEY ARE ILLUMINATING WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND TURN OFF WHILE I HIT THE BRAKES. I HAVE BEEN PULLED OVER SEVERAL TIMES AND CANNOT GET MY CAR INSPECTED WITHOUT GETTING THIS CORRECTED. I HAVE BOUGHT SEVERAL PARTS TRYING TO REPAIR THIS BUT THE PARTS ARE NOT CORRECTING THE PROBLEM. CRUISE CONTROL, STABILITY CONTROL AND SEVER OTHER FUNCTIONS ARE NOT WORKING EITHER ALL OF THEM ARE RELATED TO THE SAME RECALL ISSUED BACK IN 2014. IS THERE ANY KIND OF WARRANTY ON THE RECALL THAT WAS REPAIRED?
Lost power steering and increasing the risk of a crash. There is a recall on several Malibu just not the 2010 LTZ. I am wondering why this vehicle does not a recall when the 2004 to 2006 on the electric power steering has a recall???
Brake lights illuminate without being pressed. Service ESC and Service Traction Control lights intermittently comes on. Dealer said recall issues has already been fixed.
I COULD SMELL A FAINT ELECTRICAL SMOKE SMELL WHILE THE CAR WAS RUNNING, THEN THE INSTRUMENT PANEL QUIT WORKING COMPLETELY.  I THEN ALSO NOTICED THE DRIVER SIDE SEAT ALSO QUIT HEATING.

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 CHEVROLET MALIBU. THE CONTACT STATED WHILE HIS SON WAS DRIVING AT APPROXIMATELY 35 MPH WHEN HIS BRAKES LIGHT WERE ILLUMINATED WITH THE STABILITY LIGHT ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO A DEALER (RON NORRIS BUICK GMC1350 S WASHINGTON AVE, TITUSVILLE, FL 32780) FOR A DIAGNOSIS AND REPAIRS. THE DIAGNOSIS WAS A REPLACEMENT STABILITY CONTROL MODULE. HOWEVER THE FAILURE RECURRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THIS FAILURE. THE CONTACT'S DAD WAS REFERENCING THIS FAILURE TO NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 14V252000 (SERVICE BRAKES, HYDRAULIC, ELECTRICAL SYSTEM, EXTERIOR LIGHTING, VEHICLE SPEED CONTROL, AND ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL). THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 100,000.
TWO DAYS AGO, I NOTICED THAT MY STEERING WHEEL WOULD SHAKE WHEN I WOULD STOP AT A LIGHT OR SOMETHING BUT I COULD STILL DRIVE.  THAT SAME NIGHT, I TURNED ON MY CAR TO LEAVE A PARKING LOT WHEN MY STEERING WHEEL LOCKED UP.  IT WOULD NOT BUDGE.  I NOTICED THAT IT SAID MY ESC SYSTEM NEEDED TO BE CHECKED.   I TURNED MY CAR ON AND OFF 5 TIMES TO SEE IF IT WOULD MOVE AND IT DID NOT.  ON THE 6TH TRY, THE WHEEL MOVED AND I TOOK THE CHANCE TO DRIVE MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP.  AFTER 2 DAYS OF WORKING ON MY CAR, THEY DETERMINED THAT SENSOR WENT BAD.  AFTER LOOKING ONLINE, I SEE THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM THAT IS VERY DANGEROUS.  I COMMUTE 2 HOURS ROUND TRIP EACH DAY ON THE INTERSTATE AND I AM SO THANKFUL THAT THIS HAPPENED IN A PARKING  LOT.
BOTH LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS JUST QUIT WORKING BUT THE FUSES ARE GOOD AND THE HEADLIGHTS AREN'T A MONTH OLD.
THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE AIR BAG WARNING LIGHT KEEPS GOING OFF. PURCHASED CAR USED AND I AM NOT SURE OF THE PROBLEM. I WANT TO BE SURE THAT THIS IS A SAFTEY ISSUE FOR SOMEONE IN THE FRONT SEAT. NO ACCIDENT YET,BUT I HAVE CONCERNS. IT IS ON GOING AS TO A CERTAIN DATE.
HELLO, MY CAR IS HAVING THE ISSUES DESCRIBED IN RECALL NUMBER 13036, MY BRAKE LIGHTS TURN ON WHILE NOT PRESSING THE BRAKE AND SOMETIMES WHEN BRAKING DO NOT TURN ON AT ALL.  MY VIN # SAYS THAT MY CAR WAS NOT INCLUDED HOWEVER MY CAR IS EXPERIENCING THE ISSUES DESCRIBED.  THIS ALL HAPPENS WHEN THE CAR IS DRIVING.
WHILE DRIVING, THE POWER STEERING FAILED AND IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO TURN THE WHEEL AT APPROXMATLY 50 MPH. CONTACTED GM ABOUT THIS ISSUE, SINCE SIMILAR MODELS OF THE SAME YEAR, WITH DIFFERENT VIN NUMBERS, HAVE BEEN RECALLED FOR THIS SAME EXACT ISSUE AND THEY REFUSED TO CONSIDER REPAIRING THE VEHICLE, JUST BECAUSE MY VIN NUMBER WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL, BUT THE SAME FAULTY PARTS ARE IN THE CAR.
WHEN I FIRST TURN THE CAR ON IT WILL FLASH SERVICE ESC AND POWER STEERING WHEEL ALSO FLASH AT THAT POINT I HAVE NO POWER STEERING, AND THEN I WILL TURN THE CAR OFF AND TURN IT BACK ON AND I HAVE POWER STEERING THERE IS NO FLASHING OF ESC OR POWER STEERING. THE STEERING WHEEL WILL SHAKE WHILE STATIONARY. IN THE LAST YEAR I HAVE REPLACED ALL FOUR TURN SIGNALS AT LEAST TWICE AND BOTH HEADLIGHTS AT LEAST TWICE. WHEN I TURN ON THE CAR THE HEADLIGHTS WILL FLASH AND THEN ONE WILL GO OUT WHILE THE OTHER ONE STAYS ON DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD I DON'T HIT ANY BUMPS OR POTHOLES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND THE HEAD LIGHT WILL COME ON, AT THAT POINT IT STAYED ON FOR ONE DAY AND THEN IT WENT BACK OUT AGAIN. MY THIRD BRAKE LIGHT WILL WORK OFF AND ON, MORE OFF THEN ON. MY REAR DEFROSTERS DO NOT WORK AT ALL AND THE CONTROL ON THE DRIVER SEAT DOES NOT WORK EITHER. WITHIN THE LAST MONTH WE HAVE REPLACED THE BATTERY AND CABLES FOR THE CAR AND WAS TOLD THAT THAT SHOULD FIX ALL THE ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS AND IT DID NOT.   I HAVE 2 VIDEOS OF WHAT THE CAR DOES BUT CANNOT UPLOAD ON HERE.
I HAVE SERVICE ESC LIGHT (ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL) AND POWER STEERING LIGHTS THAT JUST RECENTLY CAME ON IN MY 2010 CHEVY MALIBU. I HAVE CALLED GM AND THEY REFUSE TO FIX THE ISSUE BECAUSE IT SUPPOSEDLY ISN'T UNDER MY VIN NUMBER [XXX], EVEN THOUGH MY CAR IS EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUE AS LISTED IN THE RECALLS. I HAVE VISITED NUMEROUS SITES FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE 2010 MALIBU'S AND HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE WITH THEM REFUSING TO FIX THE ISSUE BECAUSE IT AGAIN SUPPOSEDLY WASN'T LISTED UNDER THEIR VIN. I WILL BE GETTING A LAWYER AND IF MY CAR CAUSES ME TO GET INTO AN ACCIDENT I HAVE GIVEN ALL INFORMATION TO GO FORWARD WITH A LAWSUIT.  THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE AND I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER CAR FROM GM!!!!!!!! NOW I HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT WILL COST ME!!!! I DON'T KNOW WHY I AM EVEN BOTHERING TO WRITE THIS COMPLAINT BECAUSE NOTHING WILL BE DONE!!!    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR
HEADLIGHT CONTINUES TO GO OUT, REPLACE WITH NEW ONE ONLY LASTS A FEW DAYS. ALSO IF YOU SHUT OFF CAR TO GO GAS CAR DOESNT RESTART. THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME GET GAS.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 CHEVROLET MALIBU. WHILE DRIVING AT AN UNKNOWN SPEED, THE REAR BRAKE LIGHTS REMAINED ILLUMINATED. WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS PRESSED, THE REAR BRAKE LIGHTS WOULD SHUT OFF AND NOT ILLUMINATE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE LOCAL DEALER (COGGIN CHEVROLET, 10880 PHILIPS HWY, JACKSONVILLE, FL) WHERE THE BATTERY PACK CONTROL MODULE WAS REPLACED, BUT THE FAILURE CONTINUED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS ALSO NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE CONTACT INDICATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS PREVIOUSLY REPAIRED PER NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 14V252000 (EXTERIOR LIGHTING:BRAKE LIGHTS) IN 2014 FOR THE SAME FAILURE, BUT THE FAILURE RECURRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 99,000.
I FOUND A COMPLAINT BEFORE ABOUT THE POWER STEERING GOING OUT ON MY CAR. TODAY IS OCTOBER 17TH 2018 THE INCIDENT HAPPENED AT ABOUT 5:50 IN THE MORNING MY WIFE WAS DRIVING TO WORK IN THE VEHICLE ON THE FREEWAY AND THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT AGAIN AND THE WHEEL LOCKED UP AND TURNT THE CAR ONTO A CONSTRUCTION SHE WAS ABLE TO STOP THE VEHICLE. SHE TELLS ME THAT EVERY LIGHT CAME ON AND STARTED FLASHING THEN IT WENT AWAY AND SAID ESE, NO POWER STEERING, SERVICE, NO TRACTION. SHE TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE AND STARTED IT BACK UP AND EVERYTHING WORKED AGAIN, THIS HAS HAPPENED MORE THAN ONE TIME AND EACH YEAR IS HAPPENING MORE AND MORE.
PASSENGER LOW BEAM HEAD LIGHT GOES OUT EVERY 2 MONTHS. I HAVE REPLACED THIS 3 TIMES. REPLACING THE HEADLIGHT REQUIRES REMOVING THE FRONT BUMPER AND IT IS $120 JUST TO REMOVE THE BUMPER TO DETERMINE THE ISSUE. NEW CONNECTOR AND PIGTAILS HAVE NOT SOLVED THE BURNOUT ISSUE. UPON AN INTERNET SEARCH, I FOUND OTHER HAVE THE SAME ISSUE WITH PASSENGER HEADLIGHT. IHTTP://WWW.CARPROBLEMZOO.COM/CHEVROLET/MALIBU/2010/HEADLIGHTS-PROBLEMS.PHP    I WAS IN MOTION WHEN THIS WAS NOTICED AS I WAS PULLED OVER BY THE POLICE. ISSUE IS STILL THERE WHEN CAR IS PARKED.
I PURCHASED THIS CAR IN SEPTEMBER 2016 AND NOT MORE THAN TWO DAYS OF OWNING IT MY ESC LIGHTS DISABLED AND MY BRAKE LIGHTS WERE STUCK ON, I BROUGHT IT INTO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY REPLACED THE BREAK PEDAL SENSOR, AND THE LIGHTS CAME ON AGAIN, I BROUGHT IT IN AGAIN AND THEY ONCE AGAIN REPLACED THE SENSOR, THIS PROBLEM HAS YET TO BE FIXED ALMOST TWO YEARS LATER, THE ESC CONSTANTLY DISABLES AND THE BRAKE LIGHTS COME ON AND STAY STUCK I AM LUCKY I HAVE NOT BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT. THE DEALERSHIP I BOUGHT IT FROM HAVE FAILED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. NOW THEY ARE TELLING ME I WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR A PROBLEM THAT THEY NEVER ACTUALLY FIXED. I WILL BE DRIVING AND MY CHECK TRACTION LIGHT WILL COME ON AND MY ESC LIGHT WILL SAY OFF. YOU CAN SEE BY THE ATTACHED DOCUMENT I ORIGINALLY REPORTED THIS PROBLEM ON 9/26/2016, I PURCHASED THE CAR SEPTEMBER 24, 2016... TWO DAYS LATER AND THIS ISSUE STARTED OCCURRING AND NOW TWO YEARS LATER AND IT IS STILL NOT FIXED.
WHILE DRIVING ON AN INTERSTATE I LOST ALL POWER STEERING.   THE POWERING STEERING LIGHT CAME ON AND I HAD TO TRY TO MOVE OVER TO THE SHOULDER WHICH WAS VERY DIFFICULT.  VERY HARD TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL WITHOUT POWER STEERING. I'M JUST GLAD I WAS DRIVING AND NOT MY WIFE.    THIS HAPPENED MORE THAN ONCE.  AFTER SHUTTING OFF THE CAR IT WENT BACK  TO NORMAL BUT WOULD HAPPEN MORE OFTEN OVER TIME.  I ALWAYS KNEW THE CAR HAD STEERING ISSUES BUT ALWAYS THOUGHT  IT WAS JUST THE TIRES .  FINALLY WHEN THE WHEEL WOULD JUST SHAKE WHILE IN PARK I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT THIS IS A MAJOR RECALL IN MANY GENERAL MOTORS CARS WHICH INCLUDE EVERY MODEL YEAR MALIBU EXCEPT THE 2010.  FOR SOME REASON THE 2010 MODEL THERE IS ONLY A SPECIAL COVERAGE WARRANTY, NOT A RECALL.  GM ADMITS THERE IS A MAJOR DEFECT WITH THE POWER STEERING RECALL ON ALL THESE CARS BUT FOR SOME REASON DIDN'T RECALL THE 2010 MODEL.  THEY ONLY DID THE SPECIAL COVERAGE BULLETIN.  IF YOU ARE OVER 150,000 MILES OR 10 YEARS YOUR OUT OF LUCK.  YOU PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE DRIVING IT.  SINCE THEY PUT THE SPECIAL COVERAGE ON IT THEY ARE ADMITTING IT HAS THE FAULTY PARTS IN THE CARS.  UNEXCEPTABLE .  ALL CARS THAT THEY KNOW HAVE THESE PROBLEM PARTS NEED TO BE TAKEN OFF THE ROAD .
WHILE DRIVING ON BUSY HIGHWAY THE POWER STEERING LIGHT AND ESC LIGHT COMES ON AND THERE WAS LOSS OF POWER STEERING. IT BECAME VERY HARD FOR MY DAUGHTER TO TURN THE WHEEL. AFTER STOPPING AND TURNING OFF ENGINE, SHE RESTARTED AND GOT THE POWER STEERING BACK BUT THE STEERING WHEEL VIBRATED AND MOVED ON IT'S OWN. LATER THAT WEEK THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AND IT HAS NOT COME BACK. I'M THANKFUL SHE WASN'T HURT AND THE NUMBERS OF THE EXACT SAME COMPLAINT ON THIS CAR IS GETTING RIDICULOUS. THE MANUFACTURERS NEED TO STEP UP AND DO THE RIGHT THING.
PERIODICALLY, UPON INITIAL SWITCH-ON, POWER STEERING / ESC CONTROL ERROR MESSAGES FLASH AND POWER STEERING IS INOPERATIVE (VERY DIFFICULT TO TURN). SWITCHING OFF IGNITION AND RESTARTING USUALLY CLEARS THE PROBLEM. IN ADDITION, WHILE IDLING (STOP LIGHT) THE STEERING WHEEL PULSES OR VIBRATES SLOWLY WITH NO HANDS ON THE WHEEL.     THIS SEEMS TO BE GETTING WORSE WITH TIME; AND HAS OCCASIONALLY HAPPENED WHILE THE CAR WAS DRIVING. TAKING FOR REPAIR TOMORROW.
PLASTIC FUEL LINE FROM FUEL PUMP ON TOP OF TANK CRACKED LEAKING FUEL ALL OVER TOP OF FUEL TANK. I DO NOT KNOW WHEN THE CRACK FIRST APPEARED, BUT THE CAR WAS LEAKING GAS IN THE DRIVEWAY.
THE BRAKE LIGHTS COME ON WHILE DRIVING WITH OUT PRESSING THE BREAK PEDAL.  WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL IT PRESSED THE LIGHTS GO OFF.  THE CRUISE CONTROL IS NOT FUCTIONING AND THE ESC INDICATOR LIGHT COMES ON.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 CHEVROLET MALIBU. WHILE DRIVING 35 MPH, BOTH OF THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS SHUT OFF. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE FAILURE WAS INTERMITTENT OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. THE FIRST TIME THE FAILURE OCCURRED, THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS WERE REPLACED INDIVIDUALLY BY AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC. WHEN THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS SHUT OFF AT ONCE, THE CONTACT TOOK THE VEHICLE TO JIM BROWNE CHEVROLET OF TAMPA, FLORIDA WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE CIRCUITS IN BOTH OF THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS WERE FAULTY. IN ADDITION, THE DEALER STATED THAT THERE WAS A RECALL; HOWEVER, THE YEAR AND MODEL OF THE VEHICLE WAS NOT INCLUDED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE ISSUE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 131,000.
SINCE I DROVE THIS CAR OFF THE LOT IN 2010, ONCE EVERY SIX MONTHS OR SO, THIS CAR WILL SUDDENLY DOWNSHIFT GREATLY REDUCING THE SPEED.  IT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF ENGINE BRAKING.  IT WAS UNDER AN UNFIXED RECALL WHEN I PURCHASED IT.  THE DEALERSHIP, PARKWAY CHEVROLET, MADE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO FIX THE PROBLEM, BUT IT STILL PERSISTS TO THIS DAY.  GIVEN THE SUDDEN DECELERATION THAT THIS CAUSES, AND THE ONLY RESOLUTION IS TO TURN THE CAR OFF AND RESTART IT, I FEEL THIS PROBLEM CAN CAUSE DEATH TO THE OCCUPANTS OF THE CAR.  THE MOST COMMON TIME THAT THIS HAPPENS IS WHEN THE DRIVER IS CHANGING LANES AND THEY GO OVER A RAISED LANE MARKER - ONE OF THOSE LITTLE DOTS SEPARATING LANES IN THE SOUTHERN STATES.  THE LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED WAS TWO DAYS AGO.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 CHEVROLET MALIBU. WHILE DRIVING 45 MPH, THE VEHICLE STALLED WITHOUT WARNING AND WOULD NOT ACCELERATE OR REVERSE WHEN PROMPTED. THE CONTACT WAS ABLE TO COAST THE VEHICLE TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 90,017.
AT FIRST, WHEN STARTING VEHICLE, DIC WOULD DISPLAY SERVICE ESC AND POWER STEERING.  TURNING VEHICLE OFF AND BACK ON WOULD USUALLY CLEAR THE PROBLEM, HOWEVER, WHILE DRIVING IN A STRAIGHT LINE, THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD RANDOMLY START MOVING AN INCH OR SO TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT.  AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS, WHILE TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, THE SERVICE ESC AND POWER STEERING MESSAGES WOULD DISPLAY AGAIN, AND POWER STEERING WAS LOST.  THIS STARTED HAPPENING MORE FREQUENTLY TO THE POINT WHERE I CAN'T COMPLETE A TRIP WITHOUT THE POWER STEERING DROPPING OUT.  RESEARCH SHOWS GM IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, AND MY VEHICLE WILL BE FIXED UNDER GM SPECIAL COVERAGE 15356, SINCE I AM UNDER 150,000 MILES.  HOWEVER, I FEEL THIS IS HAPPENING TO ENOUGH TO WARRANT A GENERAL RECALL.
AFTER I START THE CAR, THE  VEHICLE WILL CHIME AS THE DIC DISPLAYS "POWER STEERING" (USUALLY ACCOMPANIED BY "SERVICE ESC" AND "SVC TIRE MONITOR"). THE ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING WILL THEN COMPLETELY GIVE OUT MAKING IT VERY STRENUOUS TO USE STEERING WHEEL TO TURN BOTH IN MOTION AND STATIONARY.     THIS PROBLEM REQUIRES THE CAR TO BE RESTARTED MULTIPLE TIMES IN ORDER FOR POWER STEERING TO RUN AND WORK SMOOTHLY AGAIN.     POWER STEERING OCCASIONALLY GIVES OUT DURING MANY TRIPS (REGARDLESS OF SPEED AND DISTANCE), WHILE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING VERY FEW TRIPS UNINTERRUPTED.     I DRIVE A 2010 CHEVY MALIBU WITH 140K MILES ON IT - THIS HAS BEEN PRETTY MUCH MY ONLY PROBLEM THUS FAR, BUT HAS NOW OCCURRED EVERYDAY FOR ABOUT 4-5 DAYS IN A ROW.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 CHEVROLET MALIBU. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE POWER STEERING MALFUNCTIONED ON THE HIGHWAY. THE CHECK POWER STEERING WARNING INDICATOR ILLUMINATED WHEN THE FAILURE OCCURRED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 100,000.
AT 92,280 MILES THE VEHICLE'S TRANSMISSION MALFUNCTIONED ON THE COMMUTE HOME FROM WORK.  THE VEHICLE WAS FINE DURING THE TRIP TO WORK, WHILE IN MOTION ON THE RETURN HOME THE TRANSMISSION BECAME UNSAFE.  THIS WAS ON A STATE HIGHWAY AT SPEEDS RANGING FROM 35-50 MPH.  THE GEARS WOULD NOT CATCH, RESULTING IN HIGH ENGINE REVS AND UNPREDICTABLE SPEED OF TRAVEL.  THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT ACCELERATE PAST 30 MPH OR SO.  THE SAME WAS TRUE FOR REVERSE GEAR.  THE VEHICLE WAS JUST OUTSIDE WARRANTY PERIOD.  OUR LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALER AT THE TIME, [XXX]  WAS UNHELPFUL IN FIXING THE SITUATION, THEY WOULD NOT SCHEDULE A CONVENIENT APPOINTMENT, AND SUGGESTED WE TOOK THE CAR ELSEWHERE FOR A SOONER REPAIR.  WE NEEDED THE VEHICLE FIXED ASAP, AND ENDED UP HAVING THE TRANSMISSION REPLACED BY A SPECIALTY SHOP AT $2800.  BECAUSE THE VEHICLE WAS OUTSIDE THE WARRANTY PERIOD, AND WE WENT TO A 3RD PARTY SHOP AND NOT A GM DEALER THE GM CLAIMS DEPARTMENT SAYS WE ARE OUT OF LUCK, NOTHING THEY CAN DO FOR US.

TAKATA RECALL-MY AIR BAG LIGHT HAS BEEN ON SINCE SHORTLY AFTER I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN AUG. 2011. I AM TERRIFIED IF I AM IN AN ACCIDENT THEY WON'T DEPLOY AND MYSELF OR A PASSENGER MAY BE SERIOUSLY INJURED.  MY SON AND I WERE COMING BACK HOME FROM DENVER AND MY CAR STARTED ACTING STRANGE LIKE IT WAS GOING TO DIE AND IT SURE DID WHILE WE WERE ALMOST OUT OF EISENHOWER TUNNEL ON THE WEST END, WE WERE ALMOST REAR ENDED BY AN 18 WHEELER! THANK GOD HE MADE IT AROUND US SAFELY AND NO ACCIDENT OCCURRED. I AM SURE I REPORTED THIS ALREADY SHORTLY AFTER IT HAPPENED AND NEVER RECEIVED A RESPONSE IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM. I WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR STARTED AFTER ABOUT TEN MINUTES AND DROVE HOME WITHOUT ANY FURTHER PROBLEMS, WAS SHAKING LIKE A LEAF ALL THE WAY....MY SON TOO.  I HAVE ALSO HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR SHIMMERING WHEN I APPLY THE BRAKE AT 55-60 MPH AND IT ISN'T JUST A LITTLE ITS SEVER AND DOESN'T STOP UNTIL I GET BACK UNDER THAT SPEED, I AM AFRAID OF LOOSING CONTROL.  I DO WANT TO SAY I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE CAR, I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE I BELIEVED IT WOULD BE A GREAT VEHICLE TO OWN AND I WAS PROUD TO DRIVE IT....THE CHEVROLET EMBLEM MEANT SOMETHING TO ME. I DOUBT I WOULD EVER BUY ANOTHER ONE, I WOULD BE AFRAID TO! IT IS SO SAD THAT THE QUALITY OF PRODUCTS AND THE PRIDE IN THE MANUFACTURING OF THEM HAS TAKEN A BACK SEAT TO PROFIT.....THE RECALLS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE RIDICULOUS!   CAN'T RECALL SPECIFC DATE AS TO TUNNEL INCIDENT, ITS BEEN A FEW YEARS BACK, THE OTHER TWO PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING SINCE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN 2011

WHILE DRIVING MY 2010 CHEVY MALIBU LT (ECOTECH ENGINE), THE ENGINE STARTS TO STUTTER AND THE ESC SHUTS OFF AND CLAIMS IT NEEDS SERVICING. THE ESC WILL GO ON AND OFF RANDOMLY. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AS WELL. I HAVE HAD THE CODES READ MULTIPLE TIMES AND CHANGED MULTIPLE PARTS BUT TO NO AVAIL. IT KEEPS STATING THAT THERE IS A MISFIRE IN CYLINDER 1. HAVE CHANGED SPARK PLUGS AND COIL PACKS. THE STUTTERING HAPPENS AT ALL SPEEDS, INCLUDING WHILE ACCELERATING AND IDLING. THERE'S ALSO BEEN TIMES OF TOUGH STEERING AS IF THE POWER STEERING IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY.

DRIVING IN VERY BUSY CITY TRAFFIC AND I ALMOST WRECKED BECAUSE THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT. I DROVE IT HOME BUT IT WAS VERY HARD TO MAKE A TURN. THIS WAS VERY SCARY AND I PULLED IT UP ON COMPUTER AND I SEE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING THEY HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THIS CAR AND YEAR. IT COST ME $ 823.63 TO GET THE STEERING  COLUMN FIXED AND RECALIBRATED.   *TR
THE BRAKE LIGHT COMES ON WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL IS NOT BEING PUSHED.  IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE CAR IS SITTING IN PARK OR BEING DRIVEN ON THE HIGHWAY, THE BRAKE LIGHT STAYS ON WHEN THE PEDAL IS NOT PUSHED.  WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL IS PUSHED, THE BRAKE LIGHT GOES OFF.  *TR
TRAVELING APPROX 40MPH, ESC SENSOR WENT OFF AND POWER STEERING WENT OUT AS I WAS BEGINNING A RIGHT HAND TURN.  TURNED OFF THE CAR AT THE NEXT STOP LIGHT AND RESTARTED, SERVICE ESC LIGHT AND POWER STEERING WERE BACK TO NORMAL.  CONTINUED TO HAVE THE INTERMITTENT ISSUE THROUGHOUT THE NEXT FEW DAYS TO NOW WHERE IT STAYS ON. CAR IS STILL FUNCTIONAL, BUT TURNING IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND WOULD BE NEAR IMPOSSIBLE FOR SOME PEOPLE. GM SERVICE IS $900 FOR A NEW POWER STEERING MOTOR + LABOR.  I GENERALLY AM WILLING TO PAY TO GET SERVICE, BUT ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING HAS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR MANY YEARS AND MANY MODELS OF GM VEHICLES.  THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE WARRANTIED/RECALLED OUTSIDE OF BUMPER TO BUMPER AS IT IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE IF IT WERE TO GO OFF AND BE THE CAUSE OF ANY ACCIDENT. AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, IT HAS WARRANTIED IN THE PAST BASED ON THE MALIBU FORUM INFORMATION (2008 AND PREVIOUS).   *TR

COMING TO A STOP ON AN OFF RAMP, BRAKES FAILED COULDN'T STOP. (IT HAD BEEN RAINING).  2ND INCIDENT ON JUNE 26, 2013, GOING DOWN HIGHWAY AND  SERVICE TRACTION LIGHT WITH SEC LIGHT CAME ON AND CAR WAS POWERING DOWN AND STEERING WAS DIFFICULT. CALLED LANDMARK SERVICE CENTER IN TAYLORVILLE, ILLINOIS THEY TOLD ME TO TURN THE CAR OFF, THEN RESTART (OF COURSE LIGHTS WENT OUT) AND DRIVE IT TO THE NEAREST GM GARAGE. (I WAS OUT OF TOWN AT THE TIME). WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE LOCATION THEY PUT IT ON THE COMPUTER AND OF COURSE NOTHING SHOWED UP BECAUSE THE LIGHTS WERE NOT ON. ON WEDNESDAY I TOOK MAY CAR TO LANDMARK IN TAYLORVILLE TO HAVE THE OIL CHANGED AND TO SEE IF THEY COULD CHECK ON THE PROBLEM. AND TRUE TO FORM THE COMPUTER SHOWED NOTHING BECAUSE THE LIGHTS WERE NO ON. BUT WAS TOLD IF THIS HAPPENED AGAIN TO GO TO THE NEAREST SERVICE CENTER AND DON'T TURN THE CAR OFF.

I BOUGHT A 2010 CHEVY MALIBU IN NOVEMBER OF 2010 AND THE CAR ENGINE CAUGHT ON FIRE IN JANUARY OF 2010. THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY WHILE I WAS SLEEPING. AT APPROXIMATELY 9 P.M. MY NEIGHBORS AWAKE ME TO NOTIFY ME THAT MY CAR WAS ON FIRE. THEY HAD CALLED 911 AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD SHOWN UP SHORTLY AFTERWARD. THE FIRE CAME FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. I NOTIFIED AMERICAN CHEVROLET IN MODESTO, CA, WHERE I HAD PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND THEY TOWED IT TO THERE DEALERSHIP. SINCE THEN I HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN A DEFINITIVE ANSWER AS TO WHAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE FIRE WAS, AND WHAT IS BEING DONE TO REPLACE MY VEHICLE OR REIMBURSE ME FOR MY COST. I HAVEN'T BEEN COMPENSATED EITHER FOR MY LOSS OF TRANSPORTATION. MY INSURANCE FIRST SAID THAT THE PROBLEM LIED WITH GENERAL MOTORS, BUT DUE TO THE PROLONG PERIOD OF TIME ARE NOW GETTING INVOLVED IN PAYING THE CAR, WHERE I WILL COME OUT LOOSING ALL MY INVESTMENT. FORTUNATELY, THE CAR WAS PARKED OUTSIDE, NOT INSIDE MY GARAGE WHERE THE CAR WOULD HAVE GOTTEN MY NEW HOME ON FIRES. I WORK GRAVEYARD AND WAS ASLEEP WHEN THE FIRE OCCURRED. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT RULED THAT IT LOOK TO BE A DEFECT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT WOULD TAKE A LARGE CORPORATION WOULD TAKE SO  LONG TO RESOLVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM SUCH AS THIS. *TR
About 8 weeks ago first my driver side speaker in the front went out then my passenger low beam light had went out and I had replaced twice then my AC quit working. I thought it was a fuse or battery or alternator issue even checked if it was it a relay fuse and it was not. Then my dash lit up ESC off and then my back driver side brake has been locked up and squealing really bad than my power steering light came on and it’s really hard to turn all of this happened within three weeks and when I looked up recalls and special warranties, my car had a few so I called GM and a couple of dealerships a few times and they have been extremely rude and unhelpful because this is not a wear and tear issue or it being 10 years old. This is clearly a sensor issue that was recalled and had a special warranty for. And I just want my steering, break and heat to work and that’s all I care about but I cannot afford $3000 to fix it when the car is only worth 2000 and I highly doubt that right now. But this is a safety issue for myself and other drivers and I need my car to take my kids to school and to care for my household.
The contact owns a 2011 Chevrolet Malibu. The contact stated that the steel cable used to anchor the front driver’s side lap seat belt had fractured. The contact stated no warning light was illuminated. The vehicle was not taken to the dealer to be diagnosed or repaired. The contact stated that the vehicle was not included in NHTSA Campaign Number: 15V269000 (Seat Belts). The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was unknown.
to begin with CD player stopped working  the service tire light stays on  the seat adjuster went out this is used to support your back while driving while driving on a residential road the car would not go in drive. The car just suddenly stopped while in drive. It goes in reverse and stays in park but the other gears do not work. It was a good thing that I was on a residential road and not the freeway. I keep having to repair the headlights left and right they keep burning out for some reason. Gets frustrating. And I have been pulled over for a burned headlight but the officer was aware the the make and model of my car have defects with headlights. He didn't site me but said to get it fixed.
While I was driving in the freeway steering wheel became hard . The dash said service ecs , ecs off. Pulled over turned car off and once turned on again car was driving perfectly fine.  The dashboard no longer indicated any issues or messages.
The contact owns a 2011 Chevrolet Malibu. The contact stated that the check engine warning light was illuminated.

THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME I'VE ENCOUNTERED THIS EXACT ISSUE, AND HAVE HAD PREVIOUS ISSUES AFTER PURCHASING THE VEHICLE (USED) BACK IN 2013. BOTH TIMES THIS EXACT ISSUE AT HAND OCCURRED, BOTH HAPPENED WHILE DRIVING. FIRST TIME, I WAS DRIVING IN A SHARP CURVE WITH MY CHILDREN IN THE BACK SEAT. THIS LAST TIME I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY. LUCKILY NOTHING WAS HIT IN EITHER CASES, HOWEVER THIS PAST TIME I PULLED MUSCLES IN MY BACK STRAINING SO HARD TO TRY AND STEER THE VEHICLE TO GET AT LEAST VERY MINIMUM OFF THE ROAD AND ONTO A SIDE STREET AND TO SAFETY. AS BOTH TIMES I WERE DRIVING THE ESC LIGHT CAME ON, AND POWER STEERING LIGHT CAME ON. RESULTING IN ME NOT BEING ABLE TO BRAKE, OR STEER - THE ONLY STEERING I WERE ABLE TO DO WAS VERY STRAINED (AS PREVIOUSLY STATED), I HAD TO PUT FORTH EXTREME EFFORTS TO GET IT TO BARELY TURN. THE STEERING WHEEL ACTED AS IF IT WERE LOCKED. THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED, AND COVERED UNDER A RECALL AS I'VE READ/HEARD A MULTITUDE OF THE SAME ISSUES THAT ARE ALL COMMON WITH THIS EXACT YEAR, MODEL/CAR. AND FOR THIS BE SUCH A DANGER, IT NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED BEFORE IT COSTS SOMEONE THEIR LIFE. I'M TERRIFIED TO THINK WHAT IF EVERYONE AROUND ME WEREN'T PAYING ATTENTION WHEN BOTH EVENTS TOOK PLACE, IT COULD'VE RESULTED IN MY LIFE. MY SPOUSE BEING SINGLE RAISING OUR PRECIOUS 4 CHILDREN. HOW CHEVY/GM CAN LIVE KNOWING THESE ISSUES HAPPEN AND NOT ADDRESS IT IS HORRIBLE, KNOWING VERY WELL IT COULD RESULT IN A LIFE I'D NOT MORE BEING LOST. THE ONLY WAY I COULD GET THE LIGHTS TO TURN OFF AND ME TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE, I HAD TO SHUT THE CAR OFF, WAIT, AND TURN IT ON IN ORDER TO CONTINUE MY DRIVE TO WORK. I'M TERRIFIED TO DRIVE THIS DEATH TRAP OF A CAR, ESPECIALLY KNOWING THESE ISSUES COULD HAPPEN AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT WARNING OR REASON. THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED. OTHERWISE THIS IS A LAWSUIT JUST  WAITING TO HAPPEN.
TIMING CHAIN AND ENGINE MALFUNCTION. REVIEWED THE INTERNET AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE SAME THING. THE 2.4 ECOTECH ENGINE WAS IN A CLASS ACTION SUIT FOR EQUINOXS BUT NOT MALIBUS AND THEY HAVE THE SAME ISSUE.
THE ESC TURNS OFF PRETTY MUCH EVERY TIME I DRIVE THE CAR. LAST MONDAY THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON WHEN THE TRANSMISSION WAS SLIPPING M. THE THE TRANSMISSION WOULD NO LONGER SHIFT AND THE SOLENOID IS STUCK OPEN WHILE DRIVING HOME FROM WORK. PROMPTING THE DEALERSHIP TO TRY AND SELL ME A WHOLE NEW $5,000 TRANS. WHEN THE CAR ONLY HAS 130,000 MILES ON IT. THE TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN RUNNING SLOW ON ACCELERATION BUT HAS NEVER BEEN STUCK IN FIRST GEAR LEAVING ME LEFT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WAITING FOR HELP TO COME GET ME. THE HEADLIGHT BURN OUT LIKE EVERY 6 MONTHS RESULTING IN TAKING OFF THE BUMPER OR PAYING $200 FROM THE DEALERSHIP FOR A $5 BULB. I HAVE NO PICTURES SINCE MY CAR IS AT THE DEALERSHIP WAITING FOR ME TO EITHER GO GET OR PAY FOR THE TRANSMISSION.
WHEN WE ARE DRIVING THE CAR IT WILL START SHAKING, THE ESC LIGHT COMES ON AND THE CAR COMPLETELY DIES.  THIS HAS HAPPENED WHILE DRIVING 15 MPH AND 70 MPH ON CITY STREETS AND HIGHWAYS.  WE HAVE HAD IT IN MULTIPLE SHOPS AND BEEN TOLD THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE NOBODY HAS FOUND A RESOLUTION FOR.  VERY DANGEROUS AND AFRAID TO PUT OUR KIDS IN THE CAR AS WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT WILL DO IT, THERE HASN'T BEEN A COMMON VARIABLE.
WHILE DRIVING ON A CITY STREET POWER STEERING LIGHT CAME ON AND I WAS UNBLE TO CONTROL THE STEERING WHILE AS IF THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT.
I HAVE A 2011 CHEVY MALIBU AND I HAVE REPLACED MY PASSENGER LOW BEAM BULB TWICE WITHIN TWO WEEKS
BROKEN WELDS UNDER THE SEAT WHERE THEY SHOULD NEVER BE BROKEN, VERY DANGEROUS! SEAT IS ALL THE WAY DOWN, DRIVER SIDE SEAT HAS COLLASPED
MY VEHICLE IS AT AN AUTO SHOP BEEN THERE FOR A  WEEK AND A HALF TO REPAIR THE CLUNKING NOISE IN THE STEERING COLUMN BUT THE MOTOR AND MODULE FOR THE ELECTRIC STEERING ASSIST  IS SEIZING UP WHICH WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO TURN IN TRAFFIC. I ALREADY SPENT ENOUGH TIME  AND  MONEY ON PARTS AND LABOR. THIS IS NOTHING I HAVE DONE TO THE CAR ONLY HAD FOR A  YEAR. I NEED YOUR HELP! THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL ISSUE! OR SEND ME A NEW MOTOR AND MODULE FOR THIS CAR PLEASE. YOU GUYS CAN AT LEAST DO THAT. I LOVE THE CAR BUT THIS IS A PROBLEM. 2.4L ELECTRIC ASSIST. THE STEERING COLUMN IS FINE JUST NEED THE MOTOR AND MODULE.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP!
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 CHEVROLET MALIBU. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 40 MPH, THE TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM WARNING INDICATOR ILLUMINATED AND THE STEERING WHEEL BECAME VERY DIFFICULT TO TURN. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE FAILURE BEGAN APPROXIMATELY A YEAR AGO AND WAS WORSENING. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO FOUR DIFFERENT INDEPENDENT MECHANICS, BUT NONE OF THEM COULD RESOLVE THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT TAKEN TO THE DEALER FOR DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 119,000.
I WAS DRIVING DOWN TROY AVE IN ILLINIOS WHEN MY CAR ALL OF A SUDDEN LOST POWER AND SAID ENGINE REDUCE AND AND STEERING WHEEL GOT STIFF. I WENT ALL THE WAY FROM 60 TO 20 MPH AND ALMOST CRASH AND GOT HIT FROM BEHIND. I HAVE HAD THIS  PROBLEM NON STOP AFTER FIX AFTER FIX. BUT NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW THE PROBLEM. THEN MY HEAD LIGHT GO IN AND OUT ON THE RIGHT SIDE EVER SINCE I HAD IT FIXED OVER AND OVER.
WHILE NORMAL DRIVING. CAR WILL GIVE THE FOLLOWING ERROR CODES: "SERVICE ESC" "SERVICE TRACTION" "ESC OFF" AND  "ENGINE PWR REDUCED" BACK TO BACK. THE CAR WILL POWER ITSELF DOWN UNTIL ~10 MPH WHILE MAKING A RATTLING NOISE. THE CAR WILL START AND ACT AS IF EVERYTHING IS FINE ONCE I PULL OVER AND FULLY SHUT THE VEHICLE OFF. THIS HAPPENS AT ANY POINT, DRIVING HIGHWAY OR NEIGHBORHOOD SPEEDS, WHILE TURNING AND EVEN WHEN IDLE.
HEADLIGHT BULB BURNED OUT - AND IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO REPLACE WITHOUT SPECIALIZED TRAINING AND TOOLS.  THIS IS A SEVERELY SAFETY ISSUE SINCE MOST PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A CAR DEALER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHEN A HEADLIGHT GOES OUT.  REPLACING THE LAMP REQUIRES REMOVING PARTS OF THE FENDER AND THE ENTIRE BUMPER, AND REQUIRES SOCKET WRENCHES AND MECHANICAL ABILITY BEYOND WHAT THE AVERAGE VEHICLE OWNER WILL HAVE.  DRIVING WITH ONE HEADLIGHT BECAUSE GM COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO REPLACE THE HEADLAMP WITHOUT TOOLS IS DANGEROUS.
LOWBEAM CONSTANTLY GOES OUT. AFTER RESTARTING THE COMPUTER THE FUSE HAS FIRE FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS AND THEN GOES OUT AGAIN.
DRIVING DOWN CITY STREET, ENGINE SPEED INCREASED AND VEHICLE SLOWED TO STOP. WOULD NOT GO FORWARD OR REVERSE. AS TRAFFIC BACKED UP BEHIND ME, SHUT VEHICLE OFF FOR ABOUT A MINUTE AND RESTARTED. VEHICLE THEN MOVED ENOUGH TO GET OFF ROADWAY THEN STOPPED MOVING AGAIN. TOWED TO CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP, THEY DIAGNOSED WITH MAJOR INTERNAL TRANSMISSION FAILURE, TRANSMISSION NEEDS REPLACED. VEHICLE HAS JUST OVER 90,000 MILES, COST TO REPAIR, ABOUT $4200
AT APPROXIMATELY 85000 MILES THE TIMING CHAIN WENT OUT OF THE ENGINE, THIS IS A NONE ISSUE WITH THESE ENGINES AND AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR AT THAT. THIS EFFECTS SEVERAL GM VEHICLES AT 85000 MILES THE TIMING CHAIN SHOULD NOT OF BEEN BAD SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS    THIS HAPPENED AS WE WERE DRIVING THE VEHICLE AND CAN CAUSE THE ENGINE TO STALL
AT RANDOM TIMES MY CHEVY MALIBU 2011 W/ FLEX FUEL STEERING WHEEL BECOMES HARD TO CONTROL. THE SERVICE ESC AND POWER STEERING LIGHTS BEGIN TO FLASH. WHEN I PULL OVER (BECOMES THIS SEEMS TO HAPPEN ON THE HIGHWAY A LOT) I TURN MY CAR OFF AND BACK ON. THE ISSUE SEEMS TO TEMPORARILY GO AWAY. MY CAR MILEAGE IS ONLY AT 107,500. I'VE READ ABOUT RECALLS AND TESTED MY VIN FOR IT. UNFORTUNATELY, I DO NOT SEE THAT MY CAR WAS ONE THAT WAS RECALLED FOR THE 2008-2013 CAR RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM.  I DON'T HAVE EXTRA FUNDS TO BUY A NEW CAR OR GET THIS ONE FIXED. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS ISSUE THAT I HOPE THEY CAN FIND A SOLUTION FOR.

THIS HAPPENED TO ME ON THE HIGHWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF A SNOW STORM AND I WAS ALMOST HIT BY A SEMI. I HAD TO SWERVE  OFF THE ROAD DOWN INTO A DITCH. IN THE WINTER IT HAPPENS ALMOST EVERYDAY. NOT IN WINTER MONTHS IT HAPPENS AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH. THE MOST RECENT INCIDENT WAS ON 7/11/17.

THIS PAST FALL MY LOW TIRE AIR LIGHT CAME ON. I TOOK MY CAR INTO FREE TIRE SERVICE WHICH IS A REPUTABLE TIRE COMPANY. IT IS WHERE I PURCHASED MY TIRES ALONG WITH A TIRE PROTECTION PLAN. THEY SAID THAT MY RIMS(WHICH CAME STOCK ON THE CAR FROM THE DEALERSHIP) ARE CORRODING MY TIRES AND THEY COULD TEMPORARILY FIX THEM WITH A SEALANT. THEY SAID THE SEALANT COULD LAST FOR YEARS OR ONLY A MONTH; THERE WAS NO WAY TO KNOW.  A FEW MONTHS HAVING THE SEALANT PUT ON (THIS PAST SATURDAY), I WAS ON MY WAY OUT OF TOWN TO KNOXVILLE (A 2 HOUR DRIVE FROM HOME) AND MY LOW TIRE AIR LIGHT CAME ON WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE. I HAD TO PULL OVER OFF THE INTERSTATE AND MY TIRE WAS ALMOST FLAT. NOT ONLY DID THIS ALMOST CAUSE ME TO BE LATE FOR AN APPOINTMENT, BUT IT COULD HAVE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT. THIS TIME I THOUGHT I WOULD REACH OUT TO THE CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME THE SAME THING ABOUT MY RIMS. MY FATHER OWNS A 2009 MALIBU AND HIS TIRES ARE NOT CORRODING. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW A COMPANY CHANGES THERE RIMS IN 2 YEARS. I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THIS ISSUE OF THE WHEELS. IF THIS TYPE OF WHEEL IS CORRODING, DAMAGING TIRES THEN I COULD OF HAD A BLOWOUT CAUSING ME TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT ANYTIME. NEW TIRES WILL NOT SOLVE THIS PROBLEM EITHER. THE TIRES I HAVE ON MY CAR ARE STILL VERY GOOD TIRES. SO EVERY TIME I PUT NEW TIRES ON MY CAR, THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE. THE ONLY WAY TO PERMANENTLY SOLVE THIS ISSUE IS TO GET NEW WHEELS ACCORDING TO THE LOCAL CHEVY DEALER.

THE THROTTLE BODY HAD TO BE REPLACED FOR $675. WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE 100K POWERTRAIN WARRANTY. CHEVROLET CONVENIENTLY STOPPED COVERING THE THROTTLE BODY STARTING IN 2011. FROM LOOKING AT OTHER COMPLAINTS FOR THE 2011 CHEVY MALIBU THIS SEEMS TO BE A VERY COMMON PROBLEM AND IS CLEARLY A DEFECTIVE OR POORLY DESIGNED PART.  *TR
CAR SLIPS 1ST TO 2ND (RPM BUZZES UP) THIS OCCURS WHEN CAR HAS BEEN DRIVEN FOR 30 MILES OR MORE AND WHEN IT IS ABOVE 85 DEGREES. IT ALSO HESITATES 2ND TO 3RD WHEN COLD. I WAS ALMOST HIT IN THE REAR TWICE WHEN THE CAR SLIPPED BETWEEN 1ST TO 2ND. TOOK CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID NOTHING THEY COULD DO AS IT DID NOT SHOW ANYTHING ON THE COMPUTER. NOTE THAT SINCE THEY LOOKED AT THE CAR ON 7/26/13 THE TRANSMISSION CONTINUES TO SLIP BETWEEN 1ST TO 2ND GEAR. NOTE THAT THE DEALERSHIP TEST DROVE IN THE MORNING WHEN IT WAS STILL COOL OUTSIDE AND DID NOT DRIVE IT BUT A FEW MILES. I WAS CHARGED FOR CHECKING THE TRANSMISSION $84.53. CAR WAS FIRST TAKEN TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP ON 11/23/12 AS THE TRANSMISSION WAS SLIPPING BETWEEN 1ST, 2ND, 3RD GEARS (44,000 MILES ON CAR). COMPUTER SHOWED NO ISSUES, CAR WAS ONE QUART LOW IN TRANSMISSION FLUID. CHARGE WAS $49.69. FIRST I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE IN PRICE AS THE DEALERSHIP 11/23/12 DID MORE AND CHARGED LESS. SECOND THE CAR CONTINUES TO HESITATE WHEN SHIFTING BETWEEN GEARS "EVERYDAY" I DRIVE IT (IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN IT IS WARM). I AM SCARED TO DRIVE THE CAR DUE TO ALMOST BEING HIT. PLUS I AM HAVING TO PAY FOR THIS WHEN IT IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY.  *TR
I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE IN MARCH 2010 FROM MANGINO CHEVROLET. IT HAS HAD A PROBLEM WITH (I BELIEVE) THE TRANSMISSION FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. THE PROBLEM IS VERY INTERMITTENT, THAT IS TO SAY IT DOESN'T DO IT ALL THE TIME AND APPEARS TO DO IT VERY REGULARLY IF THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN ON THE ROAD FOR SEVERAL HOURS OR IT IS HOT(OVER 85 DEGREES) OUT. IT IS ALWAYS THE SAME THOUGH; IT BEGINS BY NOT SHIFTING FROM 2ND TO 3RD GEAR SMOOTHLY. WHAT IT DOES IS IT TAKES SEVERAL SECONDS TO GET TO 3RD GEAR. IT IS ALMOST LIKE IT GOES INTO NEUTRAL FOR SECONDS BEFORE IT SLAMS INTO 3RD GEAR. THIS HAS LEFT ME IN A DANGEROUS SPOT WHILE CHANGING LANES ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. ONCE THE PROBLEM BEGINS, IT THEN WILL BUCK AND CLUNK WHEN IT IS SHIFTING. I HAVE BROUGHT THE CAR IN TO THE DEALER SEVERAL TIMES & EVEN CALLED ONSTAR WHILE THE PROBLEM WAS OCCURRING (AT THE DEALER'S RECOMMENDATION). I AM CURRENTLY VACATIONING IN MYRTLE BEACH SC & WAS WITHOUT MY CAR FOR 2 DAYS WHILE THE LOCAL DEALER (JUD KUHN CHEVROLET) TRIED TO DIAGNOSE THIS PROBLEM. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO DATE IS NO PARTS WERE CHANGED & ALL I GET IS THE SAME STORY THAT THERE IS NO "CODE" SHOWING UP & THEY CAN'T REPLICATE THE PROBLEM. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS FOR THE DEALER TO FIX THE PROBLEM. IF THAT INVOLVES SWAPPING OUT PARTS (TRANSMISSION, TORQUE CONVERTER, DRIVE MODULE ETC) UNTIL THE PROBLEM GOES AWAY. I HAVE ALSO NOTICED (SEARCHED ONLINE) OTHER PEOPLE ARE HAVING SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH THIS VEHICLE. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE DEALER CAN'T REPAIR THIS WITHOUT THE COMPUTER TELLING HIM HOW. I OTHERWISE AM VERY PLEASED WITH MY VEHICLE. PLEASE HELP ME TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL GM CUSTOMER FOR OVER 30 YEARS.  *TR
I HAVE A 2011 MALIBU, I CHANGED MY TIRES OUT ON MY CAR AND TIRE PRESSURE LOW LIGHT CAME ON, THEN 3 DAYS LATER SERVICE ESC LIGHT CAME ON, AN I INSTANTLY FELT LIKE I WAS IN A WRONG GEAR, POWER AND SPEED REDUCED, THANKFULLY I WASN'T IN HEAVY TRAFFIC, I'M UNDER THE 5 YEAR WARRANTY CAN I GET SERVICE, AND IS IT DANGEROUS FOR ME TO DRIVE.  *KB
The contact owns a 2012 Chevrolet Malibu. The contact stated that while driving at 55 MPH, the temperature gauge began to indicate the vehicle was overheating after which the vehicle lost motive power. The contact was able to pull to the shoulder of the roadway, where the vehicle failed to restart. The check engine and air bag warning lights were illuminated. The vehicle was towed to an independent mechanic, who diagnosed a failure with the oil pan gasket; resulting in damage to the engine, and ABS control module resulting in the air bag warning light. The contact was informed that the engine would need to be replaced. The vehicle was repaired, but the failure reoccurred. The vehicle was taken back to the independent mechanic, who again diagnosed a failure with the oil pan gasket. The vehicle was repaired, but again the failure occurred for the third time. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was 113,000.
My brake lights constantly go out. My fuses keep blowing. Every time I try to adjust my mirrors the fuses blow for the mirrors and brake lights. Also my headlights keep blowing and the headlight harness has been changed and everything. It is very dangerous not having brake lights, or being able to adjust my mirrors.
Driver seat frame bar broke. Is weld and the weld broke when I was on the road. Safety concern when I turn left or right driver seat moves a lot. I can’t drive my malibu like that, Im putting myself in risk and other drivers. First time happens to me this kind of situation. I had other oldest vehicles and driver seat never broke. Not good for a 2012 malibu with a broken frame bar driver seat. GM should fix this problem that comes from manufacure. I did a research about this and Im not alone there is a lot of people complaining about this safety concern issue that chevy malibus from 2009 and 2012 had and dealers dont want to pay attention to this problem.
I contacted this agency back in March 2022 about my power steering going out while driving after I was told there was a recall on this issue already.  This agency told me my vin number was NOT included in this recall but will start an investigation to see if it can be included.  Considering this is an safety issue and a recall on this same issue has been established.  I have yet to hear anything back from anyone about this matter. Not a letter, phone call nor an email.  This is a safety issue!  There is a recall on this already!  I thought this agency was created for consumers to protect them from issues with transportation that involved their safety? I called and spoke with a rep name [XXX] who was extremely rude and obnoxious so I'm making this report again. Can I get any assistance from this agency?  It is getting pretty scary to drive this vehicle with my wheel locking up and the repair is extremely high. I'm not sure why my vin was not included, but after doing some research, I'm having the exact same problems the other cars under this recall are having. My number has changed since my initial report.  The new number is listed below.  My old number is [XXX].   INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).
The contact owns a 2012 Chevrolet Malibu. The contact stated that while driving, the brake light was illuminated. The contact stated that at the time she was not depressing the brake pedal. The contact stated that when she was switching gears from either drive or reverse the brake light only illuminates once in gear and does not turn off. The contact also stated that the traction control warning light also illuminates while driving, however the vehicle does not drive any differently. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic who advised her that there was a recall on the same year, make and model vehicle as her vehicle NHTSA Campaign Number: 14V252000 (ELECTRICAL SYSTEM, EXTERIOR LIGHTING, VEHICLE SPEED CONTROL, ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL) . The contact said she was advised that her vehicle had to be taken to the dealer to have her vehicle reprogrammed. The contact stated that she has not yet contacted the dealer or the manufacturer at this time. The failure milage was 60,000.
THE CENTER BRAKE LIGHT DOESN'T WORK. I PUT IN A NEW LED LIGHT ASSEMBLY IN AND IT STILL DOESN'T WORK.
ON WEDNESDAY JANUARY 6, 2021, I WAS ON MY WAY HOME FROM PICKING MY SON UP FROM SCHOOL WHEN I WENT TO MAKE A LEFT TURN FROM THE CENTER DIVIDER AND MY STEERING WHEEL WOULD NOT TURN! THIS CAUSED ME TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BUSY CITY STREET AND TO PARK UP ON THE CURB TO AVOID ONGOING TRAFFIC. I TRIED TO TURN THE WHEEL MANUALLY WITH A LOT OF STRENGTH BUT IT DID NOT MOVE. THEN A WARNING SIGNAL APPEARED SAYING (POWER STEERING). I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND BACK ON TO SEE IF THIS HELPED, IT DID. AFTER I GOT HOME I DID NOT DRIVE THE CAR ANYMORE. I AM WAITING TO SEE IF THIS REPAIR IS COVERED UNDER CHEVROLET'S WARRANTY REGARDING EPS (ELECTRICAL POWER STEERING) VEHICLES.
I WAS DRIVING TO TOWN AND EVERYTHING STOP WORKING. IT SCARD THE CRAP OUT OF ME. I TOOK IT TO SMITH CHEVY IN TURLOCK CA THEY SAID THEY DIDNT KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT AND CHARAGED ME 489.00. LUCKY IT DIDNT KILL ME. GM MOTORS NEED TO DO A RECALL ON IT BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT OR LOSE THERE LIFE.

FOR NO REASON INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR LIGHTS GO ON AND OFF BY ITSELF. NEIGHBOR REPORTED CAR LIGHTS ON 3:30 AM. WE ALSO CAUGHT WHILE KEYS WERE ON TABLE AND LOCKED THE LIGHTS CAME ON AND OFF TWICE IN THE EVENING. THIS IS WHILE PARKED FOR THE NIGHT.
MY CAR WON'T TURN OVER AFTER I TURN IT OFF SOMETIMES. SOMETIMES IT WILL BE MOST OTHER TIMES IT DOESN'T. THE BATTERY IS NEW, SPARK PLUGS ARE NEW, SENSORS ARE NEW. STARTER ISN'T THE PROBLEM. DON'T KNOW WHAT IT COULD BE? IT WAS STATIONARY WHEN THIS HAPPENS, WHEN I TRY TO TURN THE CAR BACK ON.
TAKATA RECALL  WHEN MY VEHICLE STARTED HAVING ISSUES IT STARTED WITH LAGGING TO START I WOULD TURN THE KEY AND LITERALLY LET GO AND THEN IT WOULD START. NOW IT'S TO THE POINT WHERE IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WANT TO START . WHEN IT DOES MY SENSORS ARE ALL MESSED UP . FIRST TIME MY AIRBAG WARNING WAS COMING UP . NEXT MY SENSORS ON MY TIRES WERE NOT WORKING THEN I STARTED TO NOTICE WHEN I WAS DRIVING AND I WOULD STOP PUSHING THE GAS THE GAUGE WILL GO UP AND DOWN. THE LAST THING THAT HAPPENED WAS THE CHECK ENGINE CAME ON BUT TURNED OFF. I TRIED TO GET A DIAGNOSTICS DONE BUT OF COURSE NOTHING CAME OF IT . SO NOW MY CAR IS JUST SITTING IN MY GARAGE UNTIL I FIGURE IT OUT. BUT THERE ARE NO TYPE OF CHECK ENGINE LIGHT OR ANYTHING THAT COMES ON BEFORE THE CAR STARTS NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY

I NOTICED AN AIR BAG LIGHT THAT APPEARS ON THE CLUSTER OF MY 2012 CHEVROLET MALIBU UPON STARTING THE CAR.  IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY THIS AIR BAG LIGHT COMES ON, SO I CONTACTED GM AND THEY CLAIM THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON IT.  ALTHOUGH MY VEHICLE'S WARRANTY IS NO LONGER VALID SINCE IT IS MORE THAN 5 YEARS, BUT THE VEHICLE HAS VERY LOW MILES (ABOUT 22K) AND I BELIEVE GM SHOULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES FOR THIS ISSUE TO BE DIAGNOSED SINCE IT IS SAFETY RELATED BUT THEY REFUSED TO PAY FOR ANY SERVICES.  I PLAN TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER BUT I HAVE NO IDEA THE EXTENT OF HOW SERIOUS THE ISSUE IS, OR HOW MUCH IT WILL COST FOR THE REPAIRS
"TAKATA RECALL"  IF I HIT A BUMP SMALL OR ANY SIZE ACTUALLY MY ENGINE REDUCES AND I HAVE TO PULL OVER...AND TURN THE CAR OFF FOR UP TO 10 MINS SOMETIMES...  I CANT DRIVE ON THE FREEWAY AT ALL BECAUSE I DONT WANT THE ENGINE TO REDUCE WHILE DOING 60 MPH    LATELY IT WILL GO INTO ENGINE POWER REDUCE WHILE IM PARKED IN A DRIVEWAY SO I DONT GET IT
NOT A SAFETY ISSUE. I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT WHERE TO FILE COMPLAINTS ABOUT MANUFACTURING ISSUES TO START A RECALL.  MY MALIBU DIDN'T START ONE AFTER WORK TOWED IT TO MECHANIC. HE SAID IT DIDN'T HAVE OIL PRESSURE. HE OPENED UP THE ENGINE AND FOUND PIECES OF O RINGS/RTV SEALANT BLOCKING FLOW AND BUSTED RODS, LIFTERS, AND LOOSE BEARINGS OBVIOUSLY. I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY ONE OPEN THAT ENGINE.  I FEEL THIS IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT. CAR ONLY HAS 90,000 MILES. A/C COMPRESSOR WENT OUT AT 40,000 MILES, REAR DEFROST OUT REAR FUSE BOX CORRODED AND BURNED WIRES HAD TO BE REPLACED, WHEEL BEARINGS OUT IN THE FRONT AT 50,000 MILES. THIS SHOULDN'T HAPPEN WITH A NEWER CAR.  DEALER NO HELP OUT OF WARRANTY.

THIS IS MY SECOND INCIDENT REPORT FOR THE SAME VEHICLE. WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY LOST ALL MOBILITY. NO WARNING AT ALL JUST STOPPED RUNNING. FORTUNATLY I WAS NOT AT A VERY HIGH RATE OF SPEED BUT WAS GETTING READY TO MAKE A TURN OFF THE HIGHWAY. NO INDICATION THAT ANYTHING WAS WRONG AT ALL. MY CONCERN IS WHY DOES SOMEONE NEED TO GET HURT OR KILLED BEFORE THIS PROLEM IS ADDRESSED? HAVING TAKEN THIS TO BE SERVICED I ENCOUNTERED OTHERS WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE WITH THEIR VEHICLES, ALL CHEVROLETS OF ONE MODEL OR SIMILAR TO IT. BASICALLY THE SAME MOTOR. THIS HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE AND I HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN A REASON FOR THE PROBLEM.
DROVE TO WORK  AFTER WORK CAME GOT INTO CAR WILL NOT START SO CALL THE MECHANIC TO COME HELP ME AND HE TOOK IT TO SHOP AND SAID SOMETHING GOING ON WITH THE FUSE BOX AND FUEL PUMP CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT DONE THIS MORE THAN ONE TIME HAVE  TO OPEN TRUNK TOUCHED THE FUEL PUMP RELAY TO GET GOING .

"SERVICE ESC" LIGHT ILLUMINATES WHEN MAKING SHARP TURNS, SLOWING DOWN ON THE INTERSTATE, AS WELL AS BREAKING IN BAD WEATHER.

AS I WAS DRIVING MY CAR I HEARD A POP IN MY STEERING WHEEL AND FELT IT IN THE GAS PEDAL, AND IT KEEPS POPPING. MY STEERING WHEEL SHOULD NOT GO OUT! AS I WAS MAKING A LEFT TURN IT LOCKED UP ON ME AND JUST KEEPS POPPING.
I WAS DRIVING TO WORK AND THE SERVICE TRACTION LIGHT CONTROL ILLUMINATES AND THEN IT ALSO READ ENGINE POWER CONTROL. THE ROADS WERE CLEAR  AND THERE WERE NO ISSUES WITH THE DRIVE. I WAS THE ONLY PERSON ON THE HIGHWAY AND NO ISSUES. I HAD TO THEN DRIVE 30-40 MILES PER HOUR ON THE ROAD, EVEN WHEN I DROVE INTO TOWN THERE WERE CARS PASSING ME. UPHILL THE CAR WENT AS LOW AS 23 MILES PER HOUR. WHEN THE CAR WAS IDLE AT A STOP SIGN OR INTERSECTION THE CAR WOULD SHAKE BUT IT STAYED ON. AS I PUSHED ON THE GAS TO SPEED UP THE VEHICLE WOULD JERK. *TR
PULLING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE, ALL OF A SUDDEN MY STEERING WHEEL DOES A QUICK JERK, MY TRACTION LIGHT LUMINATES AND THEN SERVICE ESC COMES UP ON THE DISPLAY AND THEN POWER STEERING SHOWS ON THE DISPLAY AND AT THAT POINT IOST POWER STEERING ASSIST AND AT THIS POINT I COULD NOT TURN THE WHEEL AT ALL, I HAD NO CONTROL OVER THE CAR AT THIS POINT.  I PUT THE CAR IN PARK, TURNED IT OFF FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AND THEN TURNED IT BACK ON AND POWER STEERING WAS BACK.  THIS IS UNEXCEPTABLE...WHAT IF I HAD BEEN ON THE FREE WAY GOING 70 MILES PER HOUR AND LOST POWER STEERING.  THIS VERY ISSUE WAS A RECALL ON THE RECALLING CERTAIN MODEL YEAR 2004-2006 AND 2008-2009 CHEVROLET MALIBU(S) AND OBVIOUSLY IT IS STILL AN ISSUE WITH THE 2012 MODEL.  I HAVE HAD NO ISSUES WITH STEERING PRIOR TO THS DAY IT HAPPENED 10/30/16 AND NO WARRING POWER STEERING ASSIST WAS GOING TO FAIL.  FIX IT ONCE AND FOR ALL GM. DO YOUR CUSTOMERS HAVE TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED OR WORSE IN ORDER FOR YOU TO GET THIS RIGHT!!!!  NOW WE HAVE TO FIND THE POWER STEERING UNIT AND GET IT FIXED BECAUSE MY CAR IS LITERALLY A DEATH TRAP.  ALSO, THE INTERIOR LIGHTS (DOME) AND HEADLIGHTS START FLICKERING AFTER 10 MINS TO 60 MINS INTO MY DRIVE LIKE THERE IS AN ELECTRICAL ISSUE. ALSO, THE REAR DEFROST STOPPED WORKING AND I CAN'T SEE OUT THE REAR WINDOW, I HAVE TO DRIVE WITH THE WINDOWS DOWN TO TRY AND HURRY THE PROCESS ALONG AND THAT IS NOT FUN WHEN IT IS FREEZING OUT SIDE!

Not starting due to loss of power I believe it's electrical.
My 2013 Chevy Malibu Eco 2LT has 120,000 miles on it. I purchased the vehicle at 68,000 miles from the only owner of the car. I have had the car 6 years and kept up on all maintenance. While I was driving in a 45mph zone my vehicle’ s interior lighting started flashing. My dash flashed then said service stability track, car went blank then back on said service power steering flashed again and said service battery charging system and then went completely dead. When I got to the bottom of the hill to turn off main road my brakes had locked up in the rear and I had no power steering and wheel locked could not turn wheel. Vehicle would not allow me to shift into neutral so I could be pushed out of traffic and I had no flashers or any power.   Battery was 1year old. My biggest concern is that the vehicle never alerted me with a service engine light. There was no indication that my alternator was not responding. And mechanics and dealership service shop are wanting thousands of dollars for possible parts and labor without a clear idea of what the exact issue is. I believe that this issue was recalled but since my vehicle was not manufactured in a specific state was never repaired. I believe that my GCM has a malfunction that was to be replaced and reprogrammed with the appropriate software!!
2014 CHEVROLET MALIBU. CONSUMER STATES THAT WHILE DRIVING THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM SHUTS DOWN AND THEN RESTARTS.  THE CONSUMER STATED THE ALL THE CONNECTORS WERE CLEANED, BUT THE FAILURE RECURRED.
No warm/hot air blowing to the front windshield to defrost during winter months. Hazard to drive especially in the winter months when I need to see out the window. Heater motor works. The heat also builds up inside behind the radio screen compartment causing the radio screen to turn off.

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 CHEVROLET MALIBU. THE CONTACT STATED THAT AT START-UP, THE INSTRUMENT PANEL FEATURES FAILED TO FUNCTION CORRECTLY. RECENTLY, THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE INSTRUMENT PANEL FAILED TO ILLUMINATE AT START-UP.

THE MANUFACTURER HAD YET TO BE NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE HAD YET TO BE REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS UNKNOWN.
THE AIR BAG LIGHT AND THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON RIGHT AFTER I LEFT THE DEALERSHIP. AT THAT MOMENT I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT CARS AND THE SALES PERSON TOLD ME THEY FIXED MY ISSUE AND THAT I SHOULD BE FINE WITH THE VEHICLE. I CAN GET MY ENGINE LIGHT TAKEN CARE OF SINCE IT WAS MY FAULT, BUT I SEE SO MANY RECALLS OUT ON THE SAME TYPE OF VEHICLE FOR THE AIRBAG AND THERE IS NONE FOR MINE. I REALLY NEED ASSISTANCE WITH THE AIRBAG AND I BELIEVE IT IS A RECALL.
WHILE IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC AT A STOP LIGHT THE CAR SHUT COMPLETELY OFF WHERE MY STEERING WENT OUT, THE KEY WAS LOCKED IN THE IGNITION AND I HAD TO GET SOMEONE TO HELP PUSH THE CAR INTO A PARKING LOT FOR SAFETY. THE CAR HAS BEEN JERKING, WILL NOT PICK UP SPEED AND IF SITTING AT A STOPLIGHT TOO LONG, THE CAR WILL SHUT OFF. WHEN I PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE, THE CAR EITHER JERKS OR SHUTS OFF BUT THEN STARTS BACK UP.  *TR
2013 CHEVY MALIBU LTZ CAR SHUT DOWN WHILE DRIVING ON HIGHWAY AT 65MPH NO WARNING. PLENTY OF FUEL.RADIO AND SIGNAL LIGHTS STOPPED WORKING FIRST. NEW BATTERY PUT IN, WORKED FOR A MONTH. SAME THING WHILE DRIVING THROUGH INTERSECTION. HUSBAND UNPLUGGED BATTERY AND PLUGGED BACK IN. WORKED FINE FOR A FEW DAYS. TODAY IT WOULDN'T START NO POWER AT ALL. UNHOOKED BATTERY AND IT STARTED AGAIN. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST COMPLAINT ON THIS AND NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED. SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET KILLED.
WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY MY CAR WILL JUST SHUT DOWN COMPLETELY THEN TURN BACK ON.  SOMETIME THE RADIO WILL GO OUT WITH POWER STEERING, ETC.  IT JUST SHUTS DOWN FOR NO REASON.  WE'VE REPLACEMENT THE BATTERY CABLE SEVERAL MONTHS AGO AS WE HAD THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM AND IT WORKED FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS.  IF I USE MY TURN SIGNAL SOMETIMES IT WILL SHUT DOWN AND TURN BACK ON.  DID IT ABOUT 20 TIMES TODAY ON THE WAY TO WORK.  WITH MY TWO SMALL CHILDREN IN THE CAR WITH ME.  I AM USUALLY DRIVING AROUND 65 TO 75 MPH WHEN THIS HAPPENS.
BOTH THE TRANSMISSION AND ENGINE WENT OUT AT THE SAME TIME. I TOOK IT TO APPLE VALLEY MOTORS IN MARTINSBURG WV,  A CHEVY DEALERSHIP.  THEY CONTACTED THE THIRD PARTY WARRANTY COMPANY (PORTFOLIO)  AND THEY MADE THE DEALERSHIP REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION WITH A JUNKYARD TRANSMISSION.  BUT WHEN I TOOK IT IN THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON AND I ASSUMED THAT IT WAS ON BECAUSE OF THE TRANSMISSION. BUT ALSO ASSUMED THAT BECAUSE IT WAS A DEALERSHIP WITH SPECIAL TRAINED TECHNICIANS THAT THEY WOULD CHECK ALL THE CODES AND CLEAR THEM BEFORE THEY RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO ME. WELL THEY DIDN'T AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS STILL ON WHEN I PICKED IT UP BUT THOUGHT MAYBE I HAD TO DRIVE IT A COUPLE MILES TO RESET THE LIGHT.  WELL THE LIGHT DID GO OUT BUT CAME BACK ON ABOUT A WEEK LATER AND WHEN I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER  THEY CALLED THE WARRANTY COMPANY AND THEY SAID THAT BECAUSE NOW THAT THE EXTENDED WARRANTY THAT I HAD,  EXPIRED 8 DAYS PRIOR THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.  I CALLED BOTH GM AND CHEVY AND EXPLAINED THE SITUATION AND NEITHER ONE WILL ASSIST ME WITH THE PROBLEM ONLY BECAUSE THE POWER TRAIN WARRANTY EXPIRED EVEN THOUGH I HAVE LESS THAN A 100K ON IT.  THEY GAVE ME A CASE NUMBER BUT IN THE END THEY SAID THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.  NO WAY SHOULD BOTH THE ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION GO BAD AT THE SAME TIME ESPECIALLY WITH LESS THAN 100K ON IT.  THIS IS IN ADDITION TO ANOTHER COMPLAINT THAT I JUST FILED WITH YOU REGARDING THE CAR LOOSING ALL POWER WHILE I AM DRIVING. THAT PROBLEM HAPPENED ON BOTH THE HIGHWAY AT OVER 70 MPH AND IN THE CITY AT SLOWER SPEEDS.  IN ADDITION TO THE TRANSMISSION AND ENGINE GOING OU, 30 DAYS PRIOR THE HYDROLIC TRANSMISSION LINES BLEW OUT WHILE I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY AND I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED AND IT COST ME ABOUT 900.00 OUT OF POCKET BECAUSE IT WAS WAS NOT COVERED BY THE WARRANTY.
USING TURN SIGNAL OR POWER WINDOWS THE VEHICLE DIES AND QUICKLY RESTARTS.  ALL POWER IS LOST MOMENTARILY.  HAPPENS WHEN BATTERY VOLTAGE IS BELOW 13.5 VOLTS.  LOSS OF POWER STEERING ALMOST CAUSED AN ACCIDENT TWICE.  IT WAS NOT WET OUT OR RAINING, HAD BEEN DRY FOR SEVERAL DAYS SO WEATHER DOES NOT SEEM TO BE TRIGGERING THE ISSUE.  SERVICE STABIL TRAK WARNING ALSO FLASHED IN AND CLEARED UPON POWER DISRUPTION.

GET ENGINE OIL WARNING FOR LOW LEVEL
MY 2013 CHEVY MALIBU CAM POSITIONING ACTUATOR CAUSED MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT TO COME ON. WHEN I HAD THE CODE READ, THEY SAID THAT THE SENSOR WAS THROWING THE CODE. MY CAR JUST WENT OUT OF DEALERSHIP WARRANTY WITH 52,XXX MILES ON IT. IS THIS COVERED BY GM RECALL?
MY CHEVY MALIBU HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING INTERMITTENT ELECTRICAL ISSUES.  IT STARTED AFTER MY CAR DIED AT THE END OF AN HOUR'S DRIVE.  I THOUGHT I WAS EXPERIENCING BATTERY ISSUES BUT PERSISTED MONTHS WITH NO OTHER ISSUES.  IT HAPPENED AGAIN 4 MONTHS LATER (DECEMBER 3RD), AND THE FOLLOWING DAY THE CAR COMPLETELY DIED ON ME WHILE TRAVELING HIGHWAY SPEEDS DURING A SNOW STORM.  MY POWER STEERING WAS BARELY OPERABLE, WHILE MY LIGHTS HEAT AND RADIO COMPLETELY STOPPED FUNCTIONING.  THE DEALERSHIPS SEEM TO BE CLULESS ABOUT THE ISSUE.  THE ONE I VISITED SEEMED ADAMANT THAT THE ISSUE COULD BE STEMMING FROM MY KEY!    CHEVY HAS BEEN HELPFUL ONLY IN THE SENSE THAT THEY GAVE ME A $100 CREDIT TO GET THE CAR DIAGNOSED (WHICH HASN'T GIVEN ANY RESULTS). I'VE SEEN SOME OF THE HORROR STORIES FROM THIS ISSUE AND AM TERRIFIED TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE AGAIN UNTIL SOMETHING IS FIXED.
MY CAR INITIALLY STARTED WITH THE RADIO AND TOUCH SCREEN POWERING OFF FOR A FEW SECONDS. THEN, I WAS DRIVING AND WENT TO MAKE A LEFT TURN, THE RADIO POWER WENT OFF AS WELL AS THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKED UP, AGAIN ONLY FOR A FEW SECONDS.  NOW, WHEN IT HAPPENS (IT'S HAPPENING MORE FREQUENTLY), THE HEADLIGHTS AND DASH LIGHTS FLICKER AS WELL AS THE RADIO POWER SHUTS OFF AND THE STEERING LOCKS UP.  IT ALL ONLY LASTS AROUND 4-5 SECONDS, BUT CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS AT THE WRONG TIME.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER WHO COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM, IN WHICH I EXPLAINED IT'S SPORADIC AND UNPREDICTABLE.  THIS IS BECOMING A SAFETY ISSUE AND MORE FRIGHTENING THAT DEALERSHIPS ARE UNAWARE OF THE ISSUE OR HOW TO FIX IT.  GM REALLY NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BEFORE IT CAUSES A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  *TR
WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD ON 7/10/16 MY 2013 CHEVY MALIBU LOST POWER, ENGINE LIGHT AND TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT CAME ON AND WENT FROM 55-60 MPH TO 20 MPH. WHEN TRYING TO ACCELERATE MORE THE CAR COULD SHAKE VIOLENTLY. AFTER STOPPING AND TURNING THE CAR OFF IT WOULD NOT RESTART. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO KERRY CHEVROLET IN ALEXANDRIA, KY. AFTER DIAGNOSTIC TESTING THEY DETERMINED THAT THE FUEL PUMP NEEDED REPLACED. ON 8/10/16 WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY WHILE IN VACATION IN FLORIDA THE CAR AGAIN STARTED TO LOSE POWER, THE ENGINE BEGAN TO SLIP OR MISS AND JERK. AGAIN ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. CAR DIED THREE TIMES WHILE ON THE ROAD TRYING TO GET IT TO A SAFE PLACE FOR A TOW TRUCK TO TOW IT. IT WAS TAKEN TO A DEALERSHIP AND THE CAM SHAFT SENSOR WAS REPLACED. CAR CONTINUES TO HESITATE AND MISS.
OUT OF THE BLUE CAR LOOSES ELECTRICAL POWER, RADIO, POWER STEERING, ETC. THEN COMES BACK ON. CAR SHUT DOWN COMPLETELY WILL IN PARKING LOT. BROUGHT CAR INTO DEALER SAID THEY WOULD UPDATE THE PROGRAMING PER BULLETIN. CAR WAS GOOD FOR TWO DAYS THEN HAPPENED AGAIN. THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM, HOPE THEY CAN FIX. GM NEEDS MORE SCRUTINY...

THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER AIR VENTS IN THE DASH DO NOT STAY OPEN WHEN THE BLOWER IS RUNNING ON HIGH WITH THE SYSTEM SET TO RECIRCULATE.

Auto start stop malfunctioning, my safety as well as my children have been in the car when the car has stopped while in the middle of driving. It has stopped in the middle of the road and on the freeway in moving traffic and for 1-3 minutes the car won’t start back up leaving me and my family stranded in the middle of the road where anyone can and have almost hit us.  When I’ve sent the car to my dealer mechanic he told me the car cuts off like that because it runs hot when that is not the reason after he told me that he fixed I drove off and it stopped on me as the light was turning green for traffic to go. The car had the issue about 3 days after i purchased it I’ve which was last year 2024 in June and as of now the issue still hasn’t been fixed by the dealer
I bought the car back in 2022 and since then the stop/start started malfunctioning. At first it would stop then be hesitant to start back up then 6 months later it completely would stall at lights and stop signs. Now the aux battery is draining my main battery and I’ve had to tow my car 3 times because I’ve been left stranded. I’m now in that same predicament and it’s 2/26/24
It did not cause a wreck/collision but almost has in several instances. The Start/Stop function will activate but then when it's time for the car to start again it will not and my car will go into traffic and then completely turn off to the point I have to hard start my vehicle. This is making the cars engine light stay illuminated and I've replaced several parts and nothing seems to fix the problem. Every person I've spoke with that has the same year vehicle is having the same issue.08
2014 Malibu lt with the auto stop issues. My auxiliary batter was replaced and everything was good until my engine light came on can’t even remember exactly but the code was for the rocker arm control valve and oil pressure sensor. I replaced vvt solenoid also the intake and exhaust solenoid. Shortly after that, maybe 2 months or so after was when the auto stop started having issues. After the suto stop is engaged and my foot comes off the brake, it fails to restart after two failed attempts. I’ll manually restart it and it might start right away but sometimes wont start until the 2nd or 3rd try
MY BLOWER STOPPED WORKING.  I REPLACED THE BLOWER MOTOR AND RESISTOR AND NOTICED IT HAD ALREADY BEEN REPLACED.  I BOUGHT THE CAR BRAND NEW, SO I'M GUESSING THEY CAUGHT A RECALL BEFORE THEY SOLD TO ME.  AFTER I REPLACED THE BLOWER MOTOR AND RESISTOR, IT WORKED FOR A COUPLE MONTHS, AND THEN STOPPED AGAIN.  I'VE NOTICED PEOPLE COMPLAINING OF SIMILAR ISSUES IN ONLINE FORUMS AND AM WONDERING IF IT'S COVERED UNDER SOME SORT OF RECALL OR SOMETHING.  PLEASE HELP.
THE CARS STOP START FUNCTION IS MALFUNCTIONING AND WILL COMPLETELY TURN THE CAR OFF WHEN ENGAGED. I HAVE ALMOST BEEN REAR ENDED TWICE IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS DUE TO THIS. THIS HAPPENS ANYTIME THE FUNCTION IS ENGAGED. I JUST PURCHASED THE CAR MARCH 17,2020

MY CAR HAS BEEN SERVICED ON TIME EVERY TIME IN DEALERSHIP AND WAS IN EXCELLENT SHAPE. ON 10TH JUNE 2014, MY ENGINE JUST STOPPED WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY WITH SPEED LIMIT OF 70 MPH. IT WAS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION FOR ME AND ANY ACCIDENT COULD HAVE HAPPENED. LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO MOVE MY CAR TO RIGHT MOST LANE BEFORE MY VEHICLE COMPLETELY STOPPED WITH INDICATORS ON. THEN AN OFFICER HELPED ME PUSH THE CAR TO CURBSIDE LATER. WHEN THE ENGINE STOPPED WORKING  MY CAR WAS AT HIGH SPEED 70 MPH AND THERE WAS VERY HIGH RISK OF AN ACCIDENT. THE MECHANIC AT DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE NUMBER 4 VALE HAS THROWN A ROD (BASICALLY PISTON HAS BROKEN) INSIDE THE CYLINDER AND ENGINE IS COMPLETELY DAMAGED. HE SAID THIS SHOULD HAPPEN AT 59,000 MILES (MY CAR MILEAGE) . I FOUND TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN ABOUT THE ISSUE AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF THE SEVERITY OF THE ISSUE NHTSA SHOULD CONSIDER PUTTING THIS UNDER RECALL. GM TOLD ME YOUR CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY BY 30 DAYS AND EVEN IF IT WAS FAULTY PART THEY WILL NOT COVER IT 100%. BECAUSE OF FAULTY PARTS BY GM, NOW I HAVE TO SUFFER AN HUGE FINANCIAL LOSS AND BEAR THE RESPONSIBILITY AS GM DOES NOT CARE.

THE CAR SET ON FIRE AFTER THE ENGINE WAS TURNED OFF. WITHIN MINUTES THE WHOLE CAR WAS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT REPORTED THE FIRE WAS ELECTRICAL. GM REPORTEDLY INVESTIGATED THE CHARRED REMAINS WEEKS AFTER THE FIRE AND DECLINED TO PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION ON THE INVESTIGATION OR COMPENSATION FOR THE VEHICLE.
REAR WHEEL BEARING AND HUBS REPLACED AT 22,790 MILES AT 37,00 MILES LEFT REAR AND RIGHT FRONT WHEEL BEARINGS ARE BAD AGAIN
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 CHEVROLET MALIBU. WHILE DRIVING VARIOUS SPEEDS, THERE WAS AN ABNORMAL NOISE COMING FROM THE REAR PASSENGER WHEEL. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO JACK TAYLOR TOYOTA (3750 JEFFERSON DAVIS HWY, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22305), BUT THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED OR DUPLICATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO RADLEY CHEVROLET (3670 JEFFERSON DAVIS HWY, FREDERICKSBURG, VA 22408) WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE HUB BEARING FAILED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED, BUT THE FAILURE RECURRED A MONTH LATER. IN ADDITION, THE VEHICLE FAILED TO ACCELERATE AND THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION WORKED INDEPENDENTLY. THE CONTACT MENTIONED THAT THE GEAR SHIFTER WAS SHIFTING INDEPENDENTLY. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN BACK TO RADLEY CHEVROLET WHERE THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS UNDETERMINED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURES. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 130,000.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 CHEVROLET MALIBU. THE VEHICLE WAS INCLUDED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 14V247000 (SERVICE BRAKES, HYDRAULIC). THE DEALER INFORMED THE CONTACT, BUT MADE NO MENTION AS TO WHY THE REPAIR WAS NOT COMPLETED BEFORE THE VEHICLE WAS SOLD. THE CONTACT WAS UNCERTAIN AS TO WHEN THE VEHICLE WOULD BE REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS CONTACTED TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALER. THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE. PARTS DISTRIBUTION DISCONNECT.
THE WHEEL BEARINGS ARE GOING OUT WITH LESS THAN 40K MILES ON IT AND IT IS A WELL DOCUMENTED AND REGULARLY OCCURRING PROBLEM. ON THE MALIBU FORUM THERE ARE OVER 7 PAGES OF PEOPLE STATING THAT THEY HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THE WHEEL BEARINGS WITH AS FEW AS 19K MILES ON THEM. I AM A FEW THOUSAND MILES OUTSIDE OF MY WARRANTY SO I HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR OUT OF MY OWN POCKET BUT I THINK ITS RIDICULOUS THAT OEM PARTS, THAT THE GM SERVICE MANAGERS ADMIT ARE FAULTY, HAVE TO BE PAID FOR BY THE CONSUMER. IF MY WHEEL BEARING FAILED I COULD HAVE LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE AND PUT MY WHOLE FAMILY AT RISK OF SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 CHEVROLET MALIBU. WHILE DRIVING 35 MPH, THE VEHICLE WAS DIFFICULT TO STOP. THE FAILURE RECURRED MULTIPLE TIMES. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED.

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 CHEVROLET MALIBU EQUIPPED WITH CONTINENTAL PRO CONTACT TIRES, LINE SIZE: P215/60/R16. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THERE WAS A LARGE BLISTER IN THE FRONT PASSENGER'S TIRE.  THE CONTACT MENTIONED THAT THE TIRE PRESSURE WAS LOW.  THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER WHO INFLATED THE TIRE. HOWEVER, THE TIRE LOW PRESSURE INDICATOR ILLUMINATED AGAIN.  THE TIRE AND VEHICLE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 701.  THE DOT NUMBER WAS 6YX8BN4 3613.
I was coming home from school pickup, and the light said the engine power was reducing.  Then the screen said that I couldn't go past 25 miles per hour. The skid sign came on also. The car started slowing down on its own. The car then stopped. I had to put on emergency lights quickly. I had my daughter and grandaughter in the car. Thank God we didn't get rear ended.  I turned off the car and waited. I turned it back on and went home a half a mile away thankfully.  I looked up for a recall and Google said that there was a potential for the same thing. The check engine light came on too. This has never happened the whole time that I've had it.
The vacuum boost pump failed suddenly leaving the vehicle with no brakes and potentially causing catastrophic engine damage.
My vehicle dashboard says Engine Power is reduced. This has happened to me before and I know that it starts slowing down quickly and then just stops.  I turned off my car and waited for three minutes, and turned my car back on - it still showed Engine Power is Reduced, so I turned it back off for about 5 minutes and turned it back on and then it was back to normal. I've reported this before. This is extremely dangerous on a regular road and it could be catastrophic if it would happen on the highway.
My 2015 Malibu continues to have problems. I have a constant P Code (P2635) that refers to the fuel pump (Low Performance). The Malibu has the auto stop but at times the vehicle wants to lunge forward. It also at a stop not only goes to the auto stop (engine ) but cut off all the way . Which this result in having to place the car back in park to  re-start.  I have seen a youtube video of a hotspot (wear) on the wiring harness that is located in the right rear fender well that this blue and white wire was worn and broken possible causing this problem. Other that this issue the vehicle is good and still gets around 35mpg.
MY REAR DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR WOULD NOT STAY CLOSED AND OPENED WHILE DRIVING. I FINALLY GOT IT TO STAY SHUT BUT NOW IT WILL NOT OPEN. OUTSIDE HANDLE PULLS EASILY BUT THE INSIDE HANDLE DOES NOT
MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON TOWARDS THE BEGINNING OF DEC 2019. I TOOK IT TO A CHEVY DEALERSHIP WHO STATED IT WAS DUE TO THE ROCKER ARM OIL CONTROL VALVE AND THAT THEY NEEDED TO ORDER THE PART. I WAITED UNTIL FEB 2020 WITH NO UPDATE ON WHEN THE PART WOULD ARRIVE SO I TOOK MY MALIBU TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP WHO STATED IT NEED THE SAME PART AND THAT IT SHOULD BE THERE WITHIN A WEEK. AS OF MAY 2020 MY CAR IS STILL AT THAT DEALERSHIP WITHOUT AN ESTIMATED DATE IN WHEN THE PART WILL BE AVAILABLE. I CALLED GM AND THE ONLY THING THEY CAN DO IS OFFER $2500 TOWARDS A NEW CAR.
THE ROCKER ARM CONTROL VALVE HAS TO BE CHANGED ON MY CAR. GENERAL MOTORS AND CHEVEROLET CONTINUES TO SAY THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO GET THE PART. MY CHECK LIGHT HAS BEEN ON AND I NEED THIS MATTER CORRECTED. I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO BUY THE PART AND GET IT FIXED. I HAVE BEEN WAITING SINCE NOVEMBER OF 2019. THE PART NUMBER IS 12633613.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNED A 2015 CHEVROLET MALIBU. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING AT 40 MPH IN THE RAIN, THE CONTACT REAR-ENDED ANOTHER VEHICLE THAT HAD MADE AN UNEXPECTED STOP. THE VEHICLE'S AIR BAGS DEPLOYED UPON IMPACT; AFTER THE IMPACT, THE VEHICLE ACCELERATED ON ITS OWN.  THE CONTACT WAS UNABLE TO USE THE BRAKE PEDAL DUE TO THE VEHICLE'S AIR BAGS DEPLOYING. THE CONTACT THEN FORCED THE VEHICLE INTO PARK AND APPLIED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, BUT TO NO AVAIL. THE VEHICLE EVENTUALLY COASTED TO A STOP AFTER THE CONTACT DROVE THE VEHICLE INTO A GRASS FILLED AREA. THE CONTACT SUSTAINED A BRAIN BLEED AS A RESULT OF THE COLLISION. THE OTHER DRIVER SUSTAINED BACK INJURIES; HOWEVER, NO MEDICAL ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO EITHER PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE COLLISION. AFTER THE COLLISION, THE CONTACT WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WHERE THEY DISCOVERED SHE HAD BLEEDING ON HER BRAIN AND WAS TREATED. A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED AT THE SCENE. THE VEHICLE WAS DESTROYED AND TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP (POP'S CHEVROLET BUICK600 US-23, PRESTONSBURG, KY 41653(606) 263-1507). THE MANUFACTURER HAD NOT BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 103,000.
MY AIRBAG SERVICE LIGHT WAS ON- I HAD A DIAGNOSTIC RAN ON MY VEHICLE. I WAS TOLD BY THE GLENDORA CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP THAT MY VEHICLE WAS TOO DANGEROUS TO DRIVE AND I NEEDED TO HAVE MY AIRBAG REPLACED FOR $1,000.    I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT AND MY AIRBAGS HAVE NEVER BEEN DEPLOYED. THIS SEEMS LIKE AN ODD SERVICE NEEDED ON A NEWER VEHICLE. THIS SHOULD BE CATEGORIZED AS A SAFETY RECALL ISSUE VERSUS A MAINTENANCE NEEDED.
I WAS BACKING UP AND CHANGED MY GEARS INTO DRIVE, TURN THE STEERING WHEEL AND FOOT STILL ON THE BRAKE, CAR JUST JERKED AND TOOK OFF AND I ENDED UP HITTING SOMEBODY'S VAN. WHEN I TRIED TO HIT THE BRAKE ALL THE CAR DID WAS SPED UP SO RIGHT BEFORE I WENT OUT IN THE DRIVEWAY UNCONTROLLABLY, I HAD TO PULL UP THE PARK BRAKE JUST TO STOP
THIS WAS 3RD TIME I TOOK THE CAR INTO THE DEALER BECAUSE THE SERVICE ENGINE SOON LIGHT APPEARS RANDOMLY AND THE IGNITION FAILS TO TURN ON.  I HAVE TO TURN THE KEY A FEW TIMES TO GET IT STARTED.  MY CAR WAS SEEN THURS, WAS TOLD NO ISSUE WAS FOUND AND MANAGER WOULD DRIVE CAR HOME IN EVENING TO TEST.  CALLED TODAY, FRIDAY  IN AFTERNOON SINCE I DIDNT GET A CALL, WAS TOLD IT WAS THE BATTERY.  HAD TO PAY $260 FOR BATTERY.  THE PAST TWO OTHER VISITS, I WAS TOLD BATTERY WAS GOOD AND NOW ITS BAD...WAS JUST LEAVING THE DEALER, I STOPPED AT  FIRST LIGHT AND NOTICE THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS ON!  RETURNED BACK TO DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE. NOTHING TO DO WITH BATTERY YET ACCORDING TO THEM, THEY SAID IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE BATTERY.  MY CAR WAS LEFT FOR THE 4TH TIME IN DEALERSHIP SO THEY CAN LOOK AT IT.  A CODE APPEARED AND TECH TOLD ME IT HAD TO DO WITH THE AUTO STOP!  THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE END OF JAN!!  PLEASE INVESTIGATE.  I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE..  I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER.  I  BOUGHT CAR OCT 2015.  I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW THE BATTERY HAD BAD CELLS ALL OF A SUDDEN.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 CHEVROLET MALIBU. WHEN THE CONTACT EXITED THE VEHICLE, THE REAR WINDOW SHATTERED SPONTANEOUSLY. THE FAILURE OCCURRED WITHOUT WARNING. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE TOP QUALITY BODY SHOP WHO INFORMED THE CONTACT THAT THEY WERE NOT THE ONLY VEHICLE OWNER WHO EXPERIENCED THE FAILURE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 24,000.
BOUGHT 2013 MALIBU MARCH 2013 NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT UNTIL AT ABOUT 34,000 MILES. ON MY WAY TO WORK STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM LIGHT AND (ABS) BREAK LIGHT CAME ON. AFTER MY SHIFT AT WORK, I STARTED THE LIGHT WAS NOT ON. I THOUGHT JUST AN ERROR, MAY HAVE RESET IT'S SELF. AT ABOUT 46,000 MILES STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM, (ABS) BREAK LIGHTS ARE  BACK ON AND WILL NOT GO OFF.  I AM CURRENTLY MAKING AN APPOINTMENT WITH DEALER TO HAVE IT CHECKED OUT.
The fuel pressure system is faulty and shutting the engine down and reducing speed
Water leaks into the trunk and back seat of the vehicle because the seal around the upper brake light in the rear glass is faulty, causing a mildew/mold odor in the trunk. It is not available for inspection as I had it repaired and sold the vehicle. The problem was confirmed by the glass company to did the repair for much less than the quote the dealership provided. The vehicle was inspected by the dealership. There were no warning lamps, messages or other symptoms prior to the failure.
Update to claim #11614644. Car was inspected by Auto Lenders in Lakewood, NJ. Vacuum pump failed and cam shaft has to be replaced, was told the engine **SHOULD* be salvageable. They won't know until they start taking it apart. Was told it will take 12 hrs for each part at $180 an hr. Damage is estimated at $4500. Car is currently under an extended warranty, we are waiting to hear if the warranty will cover the damage. My son still owes $9000 on the car, we bought it 2 yrs ago. Beyond angry that Chevy/GM has not recalled this car!!!
When driving the car it will stop mid drive and slow to 20MPH. The car has broken down in the middle of the road on multiple occasions. It has locked me in the car where I am unable to get out.  On one occasion the battery was dead and the car had locked me out. I had to have someone unlock it. The next day the car was fine with no signs of issues. The car has been taken to multiple mechanics and no one knows the issue. Car doesn’t throw any codes or show any symptoms of issues.
Charged air cooler makes it so your car slows down to 20 on interstate
I was driving on the highway started to exit the exit ramp at the top of the exit ramp. There’s a stop sign. Want to stop for it previously to this my brakes were fine then I went to press on them to come to the final stop at the stop sign and they were super hard. and
While in rush hour traffic going 75 MPH on an interstate free way in the most left lane the car entered low engine power mode without warning resulting in the car being only able to go 40 MPH and with losing the ability to easily steer. Thankfully the driver was skilled enough to manage maneuvering through traffic moving at high speeds without getting hit and able to pull over to the side of the road. After traffic slowed down the driver was able to get the vehicle home without issue and investigate the problem. As it turns our there have been multiple reports of the car having this problem due to a faulty sensor on the pedal system that GM has acknowledge through extending the warranty on that specific part but has not been required to issue a recall on it despite the chance of death from an accident at high speeds that could occur from this issue happening without warning. The vehicle was taken to a dealer who confirmed it was the defective sensor.
Engine/Pistons Car has 80,000 miles and the engine/pistons have gone out on this car. I have had the car inspected by the Chevrolet dealership and they were shocked that a car that has been taken care of so good with so little miles is giving me a problem so major and expensive
Car will not completely power down, radio and headlights stay on draining batter due to an error stating “shift to park”. Car shows that it is in park. Moving gear shift through gears and turning on and off does not reset. Only way to get car to turn off is to disconnect battery.
Bought car 4/27/22 with 94,602 miles. Within a week vehicle shown problems in the engine leaking oil most likely from the oil cooler causing a bad smell of burnt tire, the shocks most likely cause the car to shake once you hit 50 mph or let go off the break pedal they need to be replaced and the tail light is retaining or holding water on the inside also the hose connected to the coolant reservoir has a small leak I don’t think the clamp was placed properly by the last person who worked on it, plus how long should it take my car to cool up so far minutes and has to be on max and 2 tires are different brand
2nd time, check engine light came on, low tire warning, loss of power down to 30 mph while driving. Turned car off and started working again.  First time it happened when I took to garage nothing showed up in code reader.
Loss of engine power; vehicle not shifting/idling; shift to park issue
Drove home from work and grocery shopping, killed the engine and noticed the fan was still running.  Got back in the car and pressed to start the engine again.  The engine stumbled to start but did start.  I killed the engine again and everything went off (including the fan) as it should have.  I decided to start the car again to see if it would repeat what happened.  The car started, but no lights came on on the dashboard or radio.  I had to press the start button again before any lights would come on.  But the engine would die about 3 seconds after the lights came on.  The light on the start button was green the entire time until I pressed it a third time. (I have video of this). After this the car wouldn't start at all.  I left the car alone for the evening.  The next morning I attempted to start the car and it wouldn't start at all, it was as if the battery was dead.  I drove my daughter's car to work.  The battery was purchased in early 2019 and was still under warranty, but the dealership wouldn't check the battery back unless it was in the car, which wouldn't start.  I purchased a battery tester and the battery was dead.  I recharged the battery and the car still stumbled to start but would eventually start after several tries.  The car appears to drive ok, but won't start without charging the battery or getting a jump start. And once it starts, it's very hard to get it to start again immediately.  This has been going on for 2 months now.  I haven't been driving the car because I have an hour one way commute to work and can't chance the car giving me any issues.  I periodically jump start the car and drive it for 5-10 miles. Yesterday, I jump started the car and when I killed the engine, the fan didn't go off again.  It took about 6 tries to start the car again, once it started and I killed the engine the fan finally stopped. The check engine light has been on and off during these past 2 months with these current issues.
MY CAR WON'T SHIFT INTO PARK SOMETIMES AND THE SUSPENSION IS MAKING A POPPIN NOISE AND MY CRUISE CONTROL IS NOT WORKING
WHILE RIDING ON THE HIGHWAY AT 70MPH I EXPERIENCED A TOTAL LOSS OF POWER. THE CAR WARNED ME AND THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. I COULD NOT ACCELERATE BEYOND 30 MPH. WHEN I HAD IT CHECKED WITH A CODE SENSOR IT TOLD ME THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR. THE CODE WAS P2138. THIS CREATED A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION ON A QUICK MOVING HIGHWAY.
MY ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AND 'ENGINE POWER REDUCED ' APPEARS ON THE DASHBOARD.  THE CAR'S SPEED DROPS & I CAN ONLY DRIVE AT 20-25 MPH. I RESTART THE CAR AND IT DRIVES FINE FOR 2MINS AND THEN GOES INTO LIMP MODE. IT'S A DANGEROUS SITUATION B/C I'M ON THE HIGHWAY DOING 60-65 AND THIS HAPPENS. I'M THANKFUL I DIDN'T GET INTO AN ACCIDENT. CODE   P2138 IS WHAT MAKES THE ENGINE LIGHT COME ON. THROTTLE/PEDAL ACCELERATOR .
VEHICLE HAS BEEN GIVING PROBLEMS SINCE I PURCHASED FROM THE DEALER, WELL ABOUT 60DAYS INTO MY PURCHASE. REAL PROBLEM IS THAT IT JERKS CONSTANTLY AT TIMES IT DOESN'T MOVE DUE TO ACCORDING TO MY OWN DIAGNOSTICS THE TRANSMISSION CONVERTER TORQUE SOLENOID AND THIS SHOULD BE HAPPENING. IT HAPPENS EVERY TIME I'M ON THE HEY IT TAKES TOO LONG TO ACCELERATE AND MANY TIMES NOT ACCELERATING AT ALL. IT CAUSES MY GAS TO DECREASE. THE OTHER DAY I WAS 30MIN FROM MY RESIDENCE AND IT TOOK 5 HOURS, LITERALLY FOR ME TO GET HOME. COMPUTER SYSTEM STARTED BLINKING CONSISTENTLY. ENGINE LIGHT STAYS ON. WINSDAHIELD WOOER LIFTS STAYS ON. TC LIGHTS STAYS ON. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CAR WITHIN 60 DAYS STAYS ON. THIS IS HORRIBLE.
I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY TODAY WHEN I HEARD A LOUD POP AND MY SUNROOF SPONTANEOUSLY EXPLODED. IT WAS AFTER THE EXPLOSION THAT SMALL SHARDS OF GLASS STARTED TO RAIN DOWN ON US. WHEN I LOOKED UP THE ENTIRE SUNROOF WAS SHATTERED. I WAS ABLE TO GET THE INSIDE SUN SHADE CLOSED BEFORE ANYONE WAS INJURED. I LOOKED TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING HITTING THE CAR, HOWEVER THERE WAS NONE. THE SUNROOF WAS IN THE CLOSED POSITION WHEN IT EXPLODED.
THE VEHICLE IS DRIVING NORMAL AND SUDDENLY SHUTS DOWN FOR NO APPARENT REASON. UPON PARKING, YOU TRY TO START THE CAR, AND IT WON'T. WAIT FOR APPROX. 30 MINS AND THE CAR STARTS BUT A BIT ROUGH FIRST AND THEN DRIVES.

THE VEHICLE WAS DRIVEN TO RYDELL CHEVROLET LOCATED AT (18600 DEVONSHIRE ST, NORTHRIDGE, CA 91324), TO BE DIAGNOSED. THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED THAT THE SHIFTER CABLE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 53,000.
I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK THIS MORNING, AND THE SPEED OF THE CAR SLOWED DOWN AND WOULDN'T GO FASTER THAN 20 MILES PER HOUR. THERE WAS PLENTY OF CARS BEHIND ME MAKING THE SUDDEN DROP OF SPEED UNSAFE. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD IT WAS THE THROTTLE, AND THAT IT'S NOT COVERED BY MY WARRANTY. I HAVE HEARD IT'S COMMON IN 2016 MALIBU'S. I HAVEN'T HAD THIS CAR THAT LONG, AND IS CURRENTLY BEING WORKED ON.
MY STABILITY TRACK LIGHT HAS BEEN COMING ON FOR 2 DAYS NOW AND IT IS NOW CAUSING MY VEHICLE TO SHAKE WHEN I AM DRIVING IT. I AM DEFINITELY CONCERNED BECAUSE THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD. THE LIGHT CAME ON ONCE LAST MONTH AS WELL, BUT NOW THE LIGHT IS APPEARING MORE FREQUENTLY.
WHEN I AM DRIVING MY 2016 CHEVY MALIBU WILL REDUCE SPEED IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC. THE DASH READS 'ENGINE REDUCED POWER'. THIS HAS HAPPENED A LOT TIMES SINCE I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE IN SEPTEMBER 2016. THE DEALERSHIP HAS NOTES OF MANY TIMES I HAVE REPORTED.
AFTER FILLING UP WITH GAS, BRAKES STARTED MAKING A LOUD NOISE AND SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE SLIPPING.  THE FIRST TIME WAS ON MONDAY, OCTOBER 21.  THERE WERE NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  AFTER 20 MINUTES OF DRIVING THE SOUND STOPPED AND BRAKES SEEMED FINE.  AGAIN ON OCTOBER 28TH, THE EXACT THING HAPPENED AFTER GETTING GAS.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON BRIEFLY AND WENT OFF.  AFTER 30 MINUTES OF DRIVING THE ISSUE STOPPED. THE SAME THING HAPPENED ON OCTOBER 29TH AFTER GETTING GAS.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND HAS STAYED ON.  THE BRAKES MADE THE SAME LOUD NOISE AND SLIPPING FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES, THEN WERE FINE.  I STOPPED AT O'REILLY'S TO GET THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CODE.  IT SAID "BREAK BOOSTER PRESSURE SENSOR" ERROR.  MILEAGE 134,000 WHEN FIRST HAPPENED, CURRENTLY 134,511 MILES.  UNFORTUNATELY THIS ISN'T THE FIRST ISSUE I'VE HAD WITH THIS CAR.  PURCHASED JANUARY 29, 2016, GASKET LEAKED WATER IN CABIN 6/16@37K, VEHICLE STALLING MULTIPLE TIMES 7/16-10/16@45K-60K NO ISSUE FOUND, MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR REPLACED 11/16@70K, STALLING AGAIN IN TRAFFIC 12/16@70K NO ISSUE FOUND, ENGINE POWER REDUCED 1/17@71K  NO ISSUE FOUND, ENGINE POWER REDUCED 1/17@72K ACCELERATOR SENSOR REPLACED, STALLING AGAIN MULTIPLE TIMES 2/17-9/17@75K NO ISSUES FOUND, SHIFT TO PARK MESSAGE WHEN IN PARK 11/17-2/18@80K ENTIRE GEAR SHIFT REPLACED.

EXTENDED WARRANTY ENDED 2/19 DUE TO MILEAGE. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ONLY CAME ON FOR 3 OF THE ISSUES LISTED ABOVE. CAR WAS TAKEN TO 2 AUTHORIZED CHEVROLET DEALERSHIPS FOR ALL ISSUES EXCEPT CURRENT BRAKING ISSUE.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2016 CHEVROLET MALIBU. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 65 MPH, THE SERVICE ENGINE WARNING INDICATOR ILLUMINATED AND THE VEHICLE STALLED. ADDITIONALLY, WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS STOPPED AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT, THE AUTOMATIC SHUT OFF FEATURE ACTIVATED. WHEN THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WAS DEPRESSED, THE VEHICLE FAILED TO RESPOND. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE FAILURE WAS INTERMITTENT, BUT WAS MORE FREQUENT IN WARMER TEMPERATURES AND WHEN THE AIR CONDITIONING WAS IN OPERATION.  THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO WHITE ALLEN CHEVROLET (442 N MAIN ST, DAYTON, OH 45405, (937) 303-5147) TO BE DIAGNOSED, BUT THE MECHANIC WAS UNABLE TO REPRODUCE THE FAILURE OR RETRIEVE A FAULT CODE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS INFORMED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 63,000.
UPON STOPPING AND SHIFTING THE TRANSMISSION INTO PARK, THE INSTRUMENT DISPLAY GIVES A "SHIFT TO PARK" WARNING AND WHEN THE "STOP / START" BUTTON IS PUSHED TO SHUT OFF THE ENGINE, THE ENGINE STOPS, BUT THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM REMAINS ENERGIZED.  THE PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT AND IT OFTEN TAKES SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO REMEDY BY RE-STARTING THE ENGINE, SHIFTING INTO GEAR, SHIFTING BACK TO PARK, THEN HITTING THE "STOP / START" BUTTON AGAIN BEFORE IT WORKS CORRECTLY.  BASED ON FEEDBACK FROM THIS AND OTHER SITES, THIS APPEARS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM AND MY LOCAL DEALER HAS QUOTED ME APPROXIMATELY $500 TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION CONTROL ASSEMBLY.  GM HAS ALSO ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN, NO. 18-NA-297, WHICH RECOGNIZES THIS PROBLEM.  THE CAR HAS 27,000 MILES ON IT AND IS 3 MONTHS OUT OF WARRANTY.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE FROM A 100 YEAR OLD CAR COMPANY THAT THE GOVERNMENT BAILED OUT JUST 10 YEARS AGO.
MY 2016 MALIBU HAS INTERMITTENTLY NOT TURNED OFF WHEN HITTING THE STOP BUTTON AND THE ERROR MESSAGE "SHIFT TO PARK" WAS COMING UP.  THE CAR WAS IN PARK.  I AM ABLE TO TAKE MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE WITH NO MOVEMENT OF THE VEHICLE.  THIS HAS INCREASED TO WHERE I HAVE TO TURN THE CAR ON AND OFF MULTIPLE TIMES AND EVENTUALLY IT ALLOWS THE CAR TO TURN OFF.  WHEN I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE SHIFTER WAS BAD.  HE STATED THAT HE KNEW THAT WAS THE PROBLEM BECAUSE IT WAS THE 8TH ONE THEY HAD REPLACED OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.  I DO NOT LIVE IN A LARGE METRO AREA SO 8 IS A PRETTY HIGH NUMBER FOR THE POPULATION.  I RESEARCHED ONLINE AND NOTICED THAT MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS FOR THE 2016-2017 MALIBU AND VOLTS OVER THE SAME ISSUE.
THERE IS TIMES I WILL STOP PUT CAR IN PARK AND SHUT ENGINE OFF AND THE SCREEN WILL READ SHIFT TO PARK. SO I WILL HAVE TO START IT AGAIN PULL AHEAD OR BACK UP AND TRY IT AGAIN. THERE IS TIMES I HAVE TO DO IT MANY TIMES BEFORE IT REGISTERS AND SOMETIMES ONLY ONCE. FOR THE DATE OF WHEN IT HAPPENED THAT WAS THE LAST TIME IT DID IT BUT HAS DONE IT IN THE PAST
HI,  I LEASED A 2016 CHEVY MALIBU. WHILE ON THE FREEWAY, MY ENGINE POWER SUDDENLY LOWERED AND A NOTIFICATION POPPED UP SAYING THE SAME. THE RPM INCREASED TO 5+ SINCE I WAS TRYING TO TAKE EXIT AND THE CAR WAS LOSING CONTROL. I EVENTUALLY GOT TO GM SERVICE AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THE THROTTLE SENSOR GOT BAD WHICH WOULD COST $150+ TO REPLACE. HOWEVER I HAVE BEEN DRIVING IT SINCE THEN AND ONCE A MONTH THE SAME NOTIFICATION POPS UP AND LOWERS MY ENGINE POWER UNTIL I TURN IT OFF AND BACK ON. EACH TIME I DO THIS, I HAVE TO SUDDENLY STOP MY CAR ON THE SHOULDER. THE SENSOR IS NOT BAD, THE CAR JUST SENSES THAT THE SENSOR IS BAD AND REDUCES POWER. THIS SEEMS LIKE A SCAM WHERE GM WANTS TO MAKE MORE MONEY. MOREOVER, I'VE READ HUNDREDS OF THE SAME COMPLAINTS WHERE PEOPLE DESCRIBE HOW THEY ALMOST LOST CONTROL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FREEWAY BECAUSE OF THE SAME ISSUE.  THIS IS A CONCERNING SAFETY ISSUE AND GM SHOULD FIX THIS AS A RECALL. I WANT GM TO ACCEPT THAT THEY INSTALLED A DEFECTIVE PART AND WILL FIX IT.  THANKS.

The contact owns a 2017 Chevrolet Malibu. The contact stated upon attempting to change a flat tire, the contact was unable to replace the wheel because the lug nuts were swollen. The contact called Roadside Assistance, who informed the contact that the lug nuts were swollen, and Roadside Assistance replaced the wheel with specialized equipment. The vehicle was taken to Goodyear Tires, where the front tires were replaced with new tires and the rear tires were rotated. Additionally, the contact was advised that the lug nuts needed to be replaced. The vehicle was taken to the dealer, where the contact was informed that the lug nuts were swollen due to cold weather. The dealer charged a fee and replaced the lug nuts with the same parts. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and informed the contact that he would be contacted later. The manufacturer later informed the contact that no assistance could be provided because the vehicle was not covered under warranty. The failure mileage was approximately 157,000.
I have had 2 incidents, and paid for repairs both times. When put in park, SHIFT TO PARK warning lights come on. First time, Oct 4, 2021. Second time Dec 16, 2024. In 2021 I was told there should be a recall, it happens a lot. I'm not seeing recall, and think I should get my money back.
On Thursday, [XXX] my [XXX]  son was driving my chevy malibu coming down the hill to get home when the brakes went out. He could not stop the vehicle and had to pass our neighborhood and let the vehicle slow itself down. He was able to get stopped and turned around and made it home. Saturday, [XXX] we decided maybe it needed new brakes and took it for new brakes. New brakes and rotors all the way around did NOT fix the problem. The brake was like hitting a brick and would not stop the vehicle. I had the vehicle towed to a repair shop and they found that the vacuum system for the brakes went out. He also noticed that cam shaft was cracked. Upon research through the internet I found that this problem is common and a class action suit has been filed against GM for the same problem. I am unsure why this is not a recall as its a safety issue and my son could have been injured or injured someone else. This has been an EXTREMELY expensive repair for us! When they went to replace the cam shaft there were several parts of the cam shaft just blown all over the engine. We still have not found all of the missing parts. This has caused most of the seals to have to be replaced as well. I do not have a repair receipt yet as the vehicle is still in the shop INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
The warning light comes on and off and is showing (P0498/P0449) which is the evaporative emission system vent control electrical circuit signal has low voltage for a predetermined period of time. Its calling to replace the evaporative emissions canister vent solenoid and I have seen 3 vehicles the same as mine needed the same thing fixed. When the vehicle is in park you can feel it jerk and also while pressing gas when you pull off it stalls. When cranking you can smell fumes .
In 2019 I took my vehicle under warranty to the purchasing dealership to fix a "shift to park" reading after the vehicle is parked. It precludes turning off the car. Repeatedly restarting the car and shifting to park and/or jiggling the controller in park usually stopped the reading.  The dealer replaced the control shifter, which fixed the problem for many years.  This August, the problem started recurring and I have been attempting to make an appointment in the last week, but none of the local dealers say they can repair this for some time. Most cannot even diagnose the problem for a week or two.
My car has reduce engine speed. I’m driving on the highway and out of nowhere the car shots down and a symbol appears on my dashboard that says Reduce Engine Speed.  Literally the car slows down to a minimal speed until I can’t drive anymore. I have to stop and turn off the car for 5 minutes until I can turn it on and drive to my destination in a reduce speed.
Engine light comes on, reduced engine power message displays. Have had numerous issues with this. Replaced gas pedal, was fine for a year. The issue is back. Why has'nt NHTSA acted on this well known issue? Car goes from 70 to 40 on the highway. GM has done nothing to fix the problem! First started around 10,000 Miles.
My vehicle has become harder to bake almost to the point that the brake doesn’t work took my car to have it accessed and was told my brake booster is damaged and causing my car to barely brake it is extremely dangerous can cause harm to myself or my family
My car has been in and out of the dealership since I purchased it back in 2017. The vehicle shuts off while I am driving it. The first time this happened I was on the highway with my 5 year old son. I completely lost power and had no control being my steering wheel locked. Since then I have repeatedly had the same issue. Each time calling the dealership and each time they find either nothing wrong with it. Or say they fixed the issue which I was charged for. For the same issue that was fixed to happen again. This happened yet again today as I was making a left hand turn onto a 4 lane highway. It happens atleast once a day. I lost all power to my car. Steering wheel locked and car refused to start. There is something going on with this car and many others.  The dealership I purchased it from agreed and offered to get me into a new Malibu being it’s a safety issue but I want nothing to do with another Chevy after my research. Too many issues with this car. THIS car has already been fixed for the recall involved AND this is still happening. And the car also won’t go into park. It says shift to park which drains the battery because the car never really shuts off.  Before the recall I payed for repairs out of pocket for what the dealership “thought” it was which it was not. Clearly because the same thing keeps happening. Nothing different. It’s all the same. This car is a lemon. God forbid my car stops in the middle of a highway and won’t start. I won’t say the rest but if there are any injuries or the worst I have documented everything through my dealership. My family and I will sue.
I have a 2017 Malibu and I pulled into my driveway to park and the car would not shift into park. The car’s stick shift malfunctioned and it was stuck in reverse.  The vehicle would not shut off and the brakes would not work. It began rolling backwards out into a busy street.  I was able to find the emergency brake to stop it from rolling too far out into the street but the car would not turn off or switch out of gear. I was unable to exit, lock, or turn off my vehicle due to the shifting malfunction, which was draining my battery. The vehicle was unable to physically shift into the park gear, but the car was also incapable of detecting the shift. No warning lights or shift to park warning came on the dashboard.  I immediately called AAA to tow my vehicle to a repair shop.  I was without a vehicle for 4 days and had to pay a costly repair of $444.95 for a known defect with Malibu vehicles. The repair shop replaced the automatic transmission shift cable and the GM/automatic transmission range selector lever. General Motors needs to recognize the problem and resolve it by recalling these vehicles, and notifying vehicle owners of this defect before someone gets injured or killed and should also reimburse customers for the repairs which they had to pay out of pocket!    Had this defect occurred while I was driving I could have been injured or killed or could have been parked somewhere in an unsafe situation unable to drive away or my vehicle could have rolled out into the busy street and hit a pedestrian, damaged someone’s property or hit another vehicle causing damages, death or injury to others.
The shifter will get not recognize it's in park. I will typically have to move around the shifter or force it from low to park multiple times for it to recognize. This has happened multiples times over the past year. I have also read online multiple other chevy malibu owners have also experienced this.
The contact owns a 2017 Chevrolet Malibu. The contact stated that while she was driving at an undisclosed speed and approaching a stoplight, the brake pedal was depressed, and the vehicle suddenly lost electrical power. The warning message "Steering Assist Reduced, Drive with Care" was illuminated. The contact was able to restart the vehicle and continued to drive; however, the failure recurred increasingly while depressing the brake pedal at stoplights. The dealer and the manufacturer were not notified of the failure. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 83,000.
Vehicle has started to make a clanking sound when going in reverse or forward at low speeds. Have taken to multiple mechanics that say there is no visible reason for the issue although they also noticed it when driving. It is alarming that the mechanics cannot find the issue and it is getting worse by the day.
2017 Malibu  with less than 36000 miles, complete shutdown of all power. Engine auto stop shuts down engine but does not restart.  Have sat in traffic for 15 minutes or longer before the engine would start.  When restarted there is no volume on the radio.  Has happened 10 to 12 times in the last 2 months. Dealership said they could not recreate issue and gave a load bull as to why it may happen...
CAR GOES INTO AN ENGINE POWER REDUCED MODE WHILE TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.
I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY TRYING TO PASS ANOTHER CAR, BUT WHILE I STEPPED ON THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL THE ENGINE POWER REDUCE WITH ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON  AND MY CAR STARTED LOOSING IT'S SPEED. I RESTARTED THE CAR AND THE ENGINE LIGHT STAYED ON AND NOW MY REMOTE START(FOB) WILL NOT START. IT ATTEMPS TO START BUT THE ENGINE WILLNOT TURN OVER.
REDUCED SPEED ENGINE PROBLEM WILL REDUCE SPEED WHILE DRIVING
IT REDUCES POWER TO THE EGINE
MY TRUNK WAS FLOODED FOR NO REASON. PLUS WHEN I SHIFT TO PARK IT SAYS SHIFT TO PARK WHEN I ALREADY HAVE. MY SISTER JUST GAVE ME THIS CAR WITH ONLY 14,000 MILES AND TWO PROBLEMS. THE TRUNK MAT IS GETTING WHITE MOLD. THIS  CAR SAT FOR 6 MONTHS.  *TR
BEGINNING SEVERAL MONTHS AGO, THE VEHICLE WOULD OCCASIONALLY DISPLAY A "SHIFT TO PARK" ERROR MESSAGE AFTER THE "START/STOP" BUTTON WAS PRESSED TO TURN OFF THE PARKED VEHICLE.  ALTHOUGH THE ENGINE WOULD TURN OFF, ALL OF THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS WOULD REMAIN ON.  FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS, THE ERROR MESSAGE WOULD DISAPPEAR AFTER A FEW SECONDS TO A MINUTE, AFTER WHICH THE "START/STOP" BUTTON TO BE PRESSED TO TURN OFF THE VEHICLE COMPLETELY.  OVER THE LAST MONTH, HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT OF TIME THE MESSAGE STAYED DISPLAYED INCREASED TO MANY MINUTES, AND IT WOULD TAKE TURNING THE CAR ON/OFF AND SHIFTING IN/OUT OF PARK MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE THE VEHICLE COULD BE TURNED OFF COMPLETELY.  ONCE THE VEHICLE WAS FINALLY TURNED OFF COMPLETELY, I WASN'T ABLE TO DRIVE IT FOR A FEW WEEKS FOR FEAR OF NOT BEING ABLE TO TURN OFF THE VEHICLE AT WORK/STORES/ETC., OR FOR FEAR OF BEING STRANDED WHEN THE BATTERY DRAINS.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE THAT EFFECTIVELY MAKES THE VEHICLE UNUSABLE.  AFTER RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM, IT WAS FOUND THAT THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE TO GM FOR MULTIPLE MODELS AND YEARS OF VEHICLES PER SERVICE BULLETIN 19-NA-206.  BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE, HOWEVER, THE INITIALLY INTERMITTENT NATURE OF THIS PROBLEM QUICKLY TURNS INTO A PERMANENT, DISABLING PROBLEM.  IN ADDITION, A MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED THAN WHAT'S LISTED ON THE SERVICE BULLETIN: (A) SCRAPING DEPOSITS OFF THE ELECTRICAL CONTACTS WITH YOUR THUMB 50 TIMES TO SEE IF THAT WORKS, (B) INSTALLING A JUMPER TO SEE IF THAT WORKS, OR (C) REPLACING THE SHIFTER CONTROL ASSEMBLY.  MY CONCERN IS THAT IF THE DESIGN OF THE NEW ASSEMBLY IS THE SAME, THE PROBLEM WILL REAPPEAR IN A FEW YEARS WITH THE REPLACEMENT ASSEMBLY; ALL ARE JUST TEMPORARY STOP GAP MEASURES.  A REAL FIX THAT PREVENTS THE CORROSION/DEPOSITS IS NEEDED, AND A RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED.
CAR STALLS WHILE OPERATING, CAR SHUTS DOWN WHILE DRIVING AND FAILS TO RESTART WITHOUT WARNING. "SERVICE STABILITY" 'BATTERY SAVE MODE' 'SHIFT TO PARK' ALL BLINK WHEN THIS HAPPENS. I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE PAST YEAR. CAR WILL ALSO SHUT DOWN WHEN THE VEHICLE IS NOT IN MOTION IE STOP SIGNS, TRAFFIC LIGHTS, STOP & GO TRAFFIC...ETC. THE CAR HAVING NO POWER THAT I CAN'T EVEN PUT MY EMERGENCY LIGHTS ON. THIS HAPPENS FOR THE LAST TIME ON 6/11/2020 CARS BRAKES BECAME TOUGH TO PUSH COULD BARELY STOP THE CAR, ONCE STOPPED THE CAR LOST ALL POWER SHUT OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUSY INTERSECTION I WAS ALMOST REAR ENDED. CAR WOULD NOT RESTART AND HAD TO BE TOWED ONCE AGAIN. ALL THE SAME WARNING LIGHTS. MY CAR IS CURRENTLY BROKE DOWN AND NOT STARTING AT ALL.     ALSO I HAVE 2' OF WATER IN WHEEL WELL CAR LEAKS WATER INTO SPARE TIRE WELL. CAR IS MOLDING DUE TO THIS ISSUE.    THIS CAR MODEL SHOULD BE RECALLED. THIS COULD CAUSE SOME HORRIBLE ACCIDENT BECAUSE OF A MALFUNCTION/ DEFECTIVE PART THAT WAS INSTALLED. THIS HAS HAPPENED TO MANY MANY PEOPLE. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS. PEOPLE ARE SPENDING LOTS OF MONEY FOR REPAIRS AND RENTAL CARS. IM A SINGLE MOTHER OF 3 CHILDREN, THIS CAR IS SUPPOSE TO BE SAFE TO DRIVE. IT'S BY FAR FROM THAT. THE MONEY I'M SPENDING ON A RENTAL CAR SO THAT I CAN GO BACK AND FORTH TO WORK IS NOT CHEAP.  *TR
EVERYT I PUT MY CAR IN PARK I GET AN ERROR STATING  SHIFT TO PARK AND THE CAR WILL NOT TURN OFF. THE CAR IS IN PARK WHEN I'M TRYING TO TURN THE CAR OFF. TOOK MY CAR TO CHEVY AND THERE IS SOME FAULTY PAPER WORK . I SIGNED OFF ON ONE CONTRACT THEN I WAS CALLED IN AND WAS TOLD SOME OF MY SIGNATURE DIDNT DO THROUGH AND NOW ITS SHOWING I CANCELED THE EXTENDED WARRANTY WHICH I NEVER DID. I STILL HAVE THE ORIGINAL PAPERWORK. THEY REVISED MY ORIGINAL CONTRACT WITH GOING OVER THE NEW CONTRACT. NOW IM STUCK WITH AN EXPENSIVE BILL FOR REPAIR BECAUSE I ASSUMED I WAS SIGNING THE SAME CONTRACT. THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE ADDED TO THE RECALL LIST FOR REPAIR. ITHIS IS NOT A USER ISSUE THIS IS A GM ISSUE.
I WAS DRIVING ON A CITY STREET GOING 35MPH WHEN MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND A NOTIFICATION CAME ON MY DASHBOARD SAYING "ENGINE POWER IS REDUCED". THE CAR IMMEDIATELY WENT FROM 35MPH TO 20MPH; I'M LUCKY NO ONE WAS BEHIND ME OR I WOULD HAVE BEEN HIT. I JUST BOUGHT THE CAR 8 DAYS AGO AT 35,000 MILES. I WAS TOLD AT THE DEALERSHIP THAT IT HAD TO DO WITH THE ACCELERATION PEDAL POSITION SENSOR. THE CAR IS LESS THAN 36,000 MILES NOW.
VEHICLE ABRUPTLY SLOWED IN HEAVY TRAFFIC FOR NO APPARENT REASON. VEHICLE WAS DIAGNOSED AS HAVING A FAULTY ACCELERATOR PEDAL. PART WAS REPLACED AT OWNERS EXPENSE 14 MONTHS INTO THE LIFE OF THE CAR. 8 MONTHS LATER THE VEHICLE STARTED TO DO THE SAME THING FOR THE NEXT 5 MONTHS, SOMETIMES 3 TO 4 TIMES IN ONE DAY OR NOT AL ALL FOR SEVERAL WEEKS. CAR WAS AGAIN PRESENTED TO DEALER FOR DIAGNOSTIC AND IT SHOWED THAT THE SAME FAULT OCCURRED. THIS IS A SEVERE SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY GENERAL MOTORS. FAULT CODES P2138 FOR ACCELERATOR PEDAL, C0242 AND U0401 FOR TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM. NEITHER OF THESE FAULTS WERE ADDRESSED BY THE DEALER DURING THE REPAIR.
THE VEHICLES BRAKES KEEPS POPPING WHERE IT MAKES IT VERY HARD TO STOP. ALSO THE CAR IS DYING WHEN THE CAR DOES COME TO A STOP SO THAT YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN PARK AND START IT AGAIN. THE BACK GLASS IS LEAKING. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS ON AND SHOWS IT BEING THE TURBO BUT HAVE HAD IT IN THE DEALERSHIP AND THE CONTINUED TO SAY IT IS THIS SENSOR OR THAT SENSOR OR A SENSOR IS DIRTY BUT NEVER FIXED THE PROBLEM. THE ANTENNA WAS REPLACED TO FIX THE BACK GLASS FROM LEAKING. NOW THAT THE VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY IT COMES THAT THE PROBLEM IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE ISSUES THAT NEVER WAS SEEN BEFORE ON THE CAR. I HAVE BOUGHT SEVERAL OF NEW VEHICLES AND THE IS BY FAR THE WORST CAR. I HAVE BOUGHT MY FAMILY A DEATH TRAP WAITING TO HAPPEN.
CAR INDICATING TO PLACE IN PARK AFTER PLACING THE SHIFTER INTO PARK AND SHUTTING DOWN THE CAR THIS HAPPENS WEEKLY AT LEAST  I WAS COMING TO A STOP AT A LIGHT AND THE CAR JUST COMPLETELY SHUT OFF NO POWER DASH FLASHED A FEW TIMES I PUT IT IN PARK, THEN I PUSHED THE BUTTON TO START IT DIDNT START. IM STUCK AT STOPLIGHT ON BUSY STREET DURING MORNING TRAFFIC. SECOND TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED
I PLACED MY CAR IN PARK AND TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE. HOWEVER, THE VEHICLE'S DASH STATED 'SHIFT TO PARK.' ALTHOUGH THE ENGINE TURNED OFF NONE OF THE ELECTRICAL SHUT DOWN AND THE VEHICLE SENT NOTIFICATION THAT THE KEYS WERE LEFT IN THE CAR WHEN THEY WERE NOT. THIS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIME. AN INTERNET SEARCH INDICATED THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM IN MY MAKE/MODEL OF CAR. THIS IS A 2017 CHEVY MALIBU.
THE VERY FIRST ADVANCED DIAGNOSTIC REPORT BY 'ONSTAR" EMAILED TO ME ON 04/07/2017, WAS LESS THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE FINAL SALE OF MY VEHICLE. I CALLED THE SERVICE TEAM FOR THE FIRST TIME ON APRIL 7, 2019 @4:13PM. (SEE PHONE RECORDS) I AM UNSURE OF THE MILEAGE HOWEVER; I DO CONFIRM IT WAS WITHIN THE 30 DAYS OF ME PURCHASING THE CAR AND I SPOKE WITH A SERVICE REP BY THE NAME OF GUY. AT THE TIME OF SALE, THE CAR HAD 15 MILES TOTAL.   THE DIAGNOSTIC MESSAGE RECEIVED ON APRIL 7, 2017 WAS "AN ISSUE WITH THE EMISSIONS/ ENGINE POWER REDUCED/ENGINE STALLED". THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ALSO ON I HAVE RECEIVED AN EMAIL TO THAT EFFECT EVERY MONTH THEREAFTER, AND TO DATE. EACH TIME CAUSING THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT TO COME ON. I HAVE ALSO ATTEMPTED TO HAVE THE CAR REPAIRED MULTIPLE TIMES, WITHIN WARRANTY AND WHILE OUT OF WARRANTY, BY TWO DEALERSHIPS. 1. ROCKMONT OURISMAN CHEVROLET &2. SPORTS CHEVROLET. BOTH SERVICE TEAMS NEVER RESOLVING THE ISSUE.   THE LAST FEW TIMES THE CAR WAS IN FOR SERVICE AT THE SENIOR ADVISOR'S RECOMMENDATION WAS ON 10/17/2018 FOR 1 DAY, 11/09/2018-11/13/2018 FOR 4 DAYS AND FINALLY 12/10/2018-01/17/2019, OVER 1 MONTH AT THE SPORTS CHEVROLET. DURING THIS TIME, UNFORTUNATELY, I WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY; THEREFORE, I SPENT QUITE A BIT OF OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES ON A RENTAL VEHICLE FOR THE DAYS MY CAR WAS IN FOR REPAIR, EVEN THOUGH THIS ISSUE WAS OBVIOUSLY RELATING THE SAME UNRESOLVED COMPLAINT FROM APRIL 7, 2017 AND THAT A CHEVROLET SENIOR ADVISOR RECOMMENDED I GO THERE. I FOUND THE SENIOR ADVISORS TO BE UNHELPFUL AND LIMITED IN REMEDYING SIMPLE COMMON SENSE CUSTOMER CONCERNS.     I HAVE LOTS OF DOCUMENTATION
THREE OF THE WHEELS ARE WORN OUT DOWN THE MIDDLE ONLY. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED. I WAS TOLD THE ALIGNMENT WASN'T THE CAUSE AND THE CHEVROLET MECHANICS FAILED TO GIVE ME AN EXPLANATION FOR THIS PROBLEM.
WHILE DROPPING OFF MY CHILDREN AT SCHOOL THE CAR CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP AND WENT INTO AUTO STOP. WHEN RELEASING THE PEDDLE SO THE CAR COULD TURN BACK ON THE WHOLE DASH BOARD AND THE RADIO SCREEN COMPLETELY CUT OFF AND WHEN THE CAR TURNED OFF IT ALL SWITCHED BACK ON. THE DASH SCREEN FLAGGED AND SAID STEERING ASSISTANT IS REDUCED DRIVE WITH CARE. THIS REPEATEDLY HAPPENDED ANOTHER TWO TIMES EVERYTIME I CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP. AFTER THE THIRD TIME THE CAR DID NOT TURN OFF AT ALL.  IN THE PAST I HAVE HAD THE ERROR MESSAGE COME ON WHEN THE CAR WOULD COME TO A STOP AND THE CAR WOULD TURN BACK ON BUT I AM BEGINNING TO BECOME VERY WORRIED BECAUSE NOW THE WHOLE DASH BOARD AND RADIO ARE TURNING OFF. I WAS ON A REGULAR CITY STREET BUT AM WORRIED WHEN I RETURN TO WORK AFTER MY VACATION I WILL GET STRANDED. I AM ATTACHING SCREENSHOTS OF A VIDEO I WAS ABLE TO CAPTURE ON THE THIRD TIME THIS HAPPENED TO ME. THE TIME IS ATTACHED ALSO.
VEHICLE HAS "REDUCED ENGINE POWER" MULTIPLE TIMES ERROR DISPLAYED AND WILL STALL ANYWHERE IN TRAFFIC CAUSING DANGEROUS SITUATIONS. THESE CARS ARE BEING SOLD PEOPLE ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS. YOU CAN STOP ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND CHECK WHAT IS WRONG BUT  RISK POSSIBLY BEING INJURED BY ON COMING VEHICLES IN ON GOING TRAFFIC.    THIS FEATURE SHOULD BE SOMETHING COVERED BY THE COMPANY FOR A BRAND NEW CAR THERE NO REASON BEHIND WHY THE CAR IS DOING THIS OR HOW THE DRIVER CAUSE THE CAR TO ENTER THIS LIMP MODE.     I DRIVE ON A HIGHWAY AT 70MPH AND THE CAR STALL COMPLETELY SENT ME INTO PANIC MODE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WARNING PRIOR TO THIS, SOON WILL CAUSE THE DEATH OF A DRIVER AND THEIR FAMILY. ONCE GETTING THE CAR HOME IT NO LONGER STARTS.
WAS DRIVING WITH CAR IN DRIVE AND CAR CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON WITH TRACTION SIGNAL STATING 'REDUCED SPEEDS'. HAD TO PULL OVER AND CAR WOULD NOT GO PAST 20 MPH. CUT CAR ON AND OFF 3 TIMES BEFORE THE REDUCED SPEED SIGNAL WENT OFF. WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AND IT HAPPENED AGAIN AND I IMMEDIATELY HAD TO GET OFF THE HIGHWAY BECAUSE MY KIDS WERE IN THE CAR.
WE HAD A DOWN POUR 05/20/2018 IN KISSIMMEE, FLORIDA.  MY VEHICLE HAD STAND STILL WATER IN MY TRUNK, THE WATER SEEPED THROUGH TO THE INTERIOR DAMAGING THE REAR SEATS, WATER COVERED THE FLOOR, THERE ARE STAINS ON THE ROOF AND THE SMELL OF AGED WATER IS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE VEHICLE. MY VEHICLE WAS PARKED AND UNOCCUPIED, THE TRUNK WAS CLOSED AND THE WINDOWS WERE UP AS NORMAL AS MY VEHICLE WAS PARKED FOR THE NIGHT.
ON FRIDAY DECEMBER 29, 2017 AS WE WERE DRIVING HOME WE ALMOST RE-ENDED ANOTHER VEHICLE IN A CITY STREET AT THE SPEED OF 55 MPH DUE TO CAR BRAKES LOCKING AND HARD TO PRESS DOWN, LUCKILY HARD WE WERE ABLE FO BRAKE BY PUSHING HARD ENOUGH. ALSO SENSOR HAVE FAILED TWICE- THREE TIMES IN HEAVY TRAFFIC AND WILL BRAKE ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT ANY CAR BEING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME WHICH IS SCARY AND COULD CAUSE A MAJOR ACCIDENT ON THE HIGHWAY. WE CONTACT GMC AND FILED A CLAIM (83737025405) AND ALSO TOOK IT TO THE CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP IN OUR HOMETOWN WHICH IS NOT DOING MUCH BUT CHARGING US $1000+ FOR  A CHANGE ON A VACUUM TOP AND SEAL BUT DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE FOR WE HAVE ALMOST CRASHED OVER 4 TIMES DUE TO THESE ISSUES.
the dashboard displays “shift to park” when i try to turn off my car even though it’s in park
On [XXX] while driving at highway speed on [XXX] in Columbia SC vehicle lost power and shut down. Was able to move to emergency lane. Car would not start. Called AAA for tow back to Chevrolet dealer in York SC. Dealer performed diagnostic test and found fuel pump driver control module had failed. Part was replaced and car returned to service. Car mileage at time of failure 70,949  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
On 11/2/24, Dashboard was displaying "shift to park" message when car was turned off and in park, ignition button displayed orange.  Was advised by service advisor that this is a known Chevrolet issue but no recall issued to date. The fix required a park switch  replacement; jumper park switched was installed on 11/7/24.
Vehicle suddenly went into reduced engine power mode and nearly caused a crash. We pulled off to the side of the highway. Turned the car off and waited for about 5 minutes with our small children in the back seat. Restarted the car and check engine light remains on but the reduced engine power warning turned off. This just happened today and have not been to the dealership. Hoping Chevy recognizes this safety issue and issues a recall as many others have reported the same issue.
Sunroof…I was driving down the road on march 12,2024 at 2pm and was doing 35 mph and had my sunroof open and all of sudden the glass cracked and broke a little at me a little going into my eyes while driving I was the only one on road and nothing was around nothing flew and hit it it just broke and was like what the hell.. I’ve had sunroofs in all my cars and never shattered at me..so I’m filling this app out to see for answers because that just don’t do that out of nowhere..
The contact owns a 2018 Chevrolet Malibu. The contact stated while driving approximately 60 MPH, the braking system failed, and the brake pedal became firm while depressed. The "Engine Power Reduced" message was displayed, and the vehicle went into LIMP Mode, causing the vehicle to decelerate. The vehicle was later towed to the local dealer who diagnosed the vehicle and determined that the braking system vacuum booster pump had failed and needed to be replaced, along with the camshaft and crank case which were damaged during the failure. The vehicle was not yet repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure, but no assistance was offered. The failure mileage was 107,000
My car does not register when it is park. I cannot disable the car when this happens. I have been that my car is not in the recall that has already been issued for this issue.
My check engine light will come on, a message will pop up on the screen saying, "steering assist reduced drive with care." When i come to a stop and my car goes into auto stop the car will completely shut down. This can be in the middle of the street or during traffic. It will take my car awhile to start back up. I was told it is a sensor that is going bad consistently, this has happened to me 3 times. This is a known issue with a lot of Chevy Malibu.
Car keeps saying shift to park after being in park. Does not allow car to turn off at all. I literally sat in the car for 30 minutes trying to get it to work. I just purchaswd this car in January and this should not be happening. Please assist
Suddenly loss of power at cruising speeds. Trouble with acceleration and loss of power. Unresponsiveness from the engine.  The Check Engine Light illuminate, OBD2 call for code P2138. The speed stuck at 30 m/h on the 65 m/h thruway which cause unsafe situation for me and other drivers on the road. When googling this issue on the internet, reviews show it is common problem in this model. GM refuses to fix this issue at their cost because "according to the VIN number of my car, it is not included in the recall list" which it does not make sense.
The contact owns a 2018 Chevrolet Malibu. The contact stated while driving approximately 65 MPH, the vehicle stalled, causing the power steering and power brake functionality to become inoperable. The contact stated he was unsure if any warning lights were illuminated. The contact had managed to coast off to the side of the roadway. The contact stated that several attempts were needed to restart the vehicle and he was able to drive the vehicle to his destination. The contact stated that the failure started off as an intermittent failure, but gradually had become a constant failure. The contact stated that the failure recurred and the vehicle had to be towed. The contact had taken the vehicle to a local dealer on several occasions to be diagnosed; however, the mechanic was unable to duplicate the failure. Additionally, the contact stated that the radio would randomly switch through the preselected stations. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer had been informed of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 75.
Something draining my battery done put a new battery in it no lights or anything on when I get out been going on for bout 3 months now
Component/System:  Transmission shift control not correctly sensing vehicle has been placed in parked condition.  Symptom:  After parking and shutting off engine, message is displayed "Shift to Park" and car dings and lights and electronics will not turn off.  Started about a week ago and was intermittent.  Jiggling the transmission shift handle would always cause message to go away and electronics to turn off.  Today, no amount of manipulating the transmission control handle will shut off the message.  Tried to leave car in garage but lights and radio kept running.  Decided to manually shut off lights and radio/info system hoping system will time out and shut down on its own.  Finally got in contact with dealership who recommended I disconnect the battery cable until I can get the car into the shop.  Safety concern:  Though transmission can be verified as being in park, electronics will not shut down, thereby potentially allowing the electrical system to drain battery and not allowing car to be started when needed.  Also, a bit concerned it was suggested by dealership I disconnect battery cable to eliminate power drain while "Shift to Park" error is occurring.  Problem reproduced/confirmed by dealer:  Not yet as the problem had a rapid onset from intermittent to full time over the course of a week.  Having a bit of difficulty getting appointment scheduled that will get problem investigated and fixed.  Loaner cars were discontinued last December and I live too far from dealership to be driven home.  Inspection:  No inspection has yet occurred; however, I have taken picture of "Shift to Park" message while transmission control handle is in the park position.  Prior indications:  There were no other signs of a problem.  "Shift to Park" simply started and was intermittent over the course of a week.  Jiggling the transmission control handle would quickly resolve the issue, then today, it has no impact.
The harness and shifter solenoid went bad in my car. When I was on the highway, it stalled causing me to have to pull over onside the road. I nearly got hit in the rear by an 18-wheeler. There was an TSB on the make, model, and year of the car, but GM did not inform their customers of the issue and the dangerous situation one could be in if the car decided to malfunction in the middle of traffic.  I was almost rear-ended from behind by an 18-wheeler while on the highway going 60 miles per hour. I also was stranded on the side of the road because they said they could not send anyone out.  Malcolm Cunningham Chevrolet, a local Chevy dealer is aware of the issues with the vehicles, but when I bought my vehicle into the shop to get fixed, they lied and said I had wasted something in my car. They provided no pictures of the spills or pictures of the parts with the contamination that they claimed it had on it.  The only person that inspected my car was Logan and the other technicians at Malcolm Cunningham Chevrolet in Augusta, Georgia.   No, there was no warning lights indicating my harness and solenoid needed to be checked.
Vehicle jerks when accelerating. Loses power. Usually will stop after turning the car off for a few minutes. Different engine codes have came up (camshaft position timer, air intake system) no one can seem to find the problem
Car displayed steering assistance reduced  about 2 or 3 times whole driving and I wasn't sure what that meant because it popped up and disappeared so quickly. So a few days later it never appeared again. On this morning as I'm driving and come to a red light to make a left hand turn while waiting and taking my feet off the brake to go cause my light is now green my car turns completely off and I'm stuck at a intersection about 2 to 3 mins later it tells me to start it back up.
My ‘18 Malibu LT has over 39K miles , and just tonight, i started my car  , the engine light and traction control light both  came on, followed by a message saying “Engine Power Reduced”. I then decided to drive for a little to see if i notice any problem. After driving for about 4 minutes , my car went from 37mph down to 20mph . It felt like the engine was forcing itself . So i then pulled over to the side of the curb, turn the car off, then back on.  i noticed the warning engine light was still there but the traction light weren’t there no more. So i drove back to my place , turned my engine off. Then i plugged my diagnostic device  to see what code(s)were they, and 1 code came up and it was P2138. Which is Throttle/Pedal Position Sensor. Oh by the way, I also would like to mention one more thing which is  the “Shift to Park” message i started seeing whenever i park my car (putting the gear in park) and this first happened when my car was at 38K Miles (about a month ago).

WE BOUGHT THIS CAR NEW AND IT HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP 4 TIMES FOR THIS RECALL.  WE WISH TO RECEIVE A NEW CAR FOR SAFETY REASONS.  WE ARE TAKING THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN TODAY BUT I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE.

I went to put car in park and when it was in park I was still getting shift to park alert on dashboard. With this alert I was unable to turn off the vehicle. After about 30 minutes the first time it happened I was able to get it to acknowledge the car was in park by moving my car around parking lot and shifting from drive to park. The next day it happened again but this time I had to jiggle the shifter to get it to go into park after trying for about 30 minutes. The alert basically trapped me in a car that would not turn off. I took it to the dealer service center the next day and was told it is a common problem with my car. Repair bill was $400 and told it was not a recall or something gm would warranty.
I have no Brake Lights when applying the Brakes and cruise control no longer works due to Service ESC message on display. I was advised by replacing the battery this would clear the ESC but it did not. I believe the service ESC message is tied into the brake lights and cruise control not working.
Driving along the interstate the car suddenly lost power. I was able to pull over and restart car and drive like nothing ever happened. Then once I parked the car at my destination the car would not start 10 minutes later leaving me stranded in an unfamiliar city. When trying to start the car it would click and the DIC would display Batter Saver Active following EMS following Power Steering. No check engine light was on in the vehicle before this incident. I was stranded in an unfamiliar city with no one around to help. After asking a random stranger for a jump the car started and allowed me to get home. No dealership can convey the problem with the car, everyone says there's nothing wrong with it. I have had the vehicle for about one year now with no problem up to now. The car often backfires and even completely cuts off at red lights (not from the auto stop feature). This is dangerous.
While driving on the highway my car started loosing power.  A warning light came on stating Engine Power is reduced.  I could not excelerate had to pull over on side of road. This is the first time this has happened to me but I  just purchased this vehicle on 7/15/21 with 51,000 miles.
WHEN DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY THE WHEELS FEEL LIKE THERE ARE PUSHING ONE WAY. WHEN SLOWING DOWN THE STEERING WHEEL SHAKES. PRESSING THE ON BRAKES THE STEERING WHEEL ALSO SHAKES. COUPLE DAYS AGO WE HAD TO TIGHTEN THE LUG NUTS ON THE CAR FRONT TIRES. ITS WAS GOOD A COUPLE DAYS AND NOW AGAIN DOING THE SAME THING..  *TR
Getting engine power reduced messsge in shop 4th time now in 3 weeks, 2 service bulletins, now they want to put new engine, found over 800 complaints about same issue on car complaint.com website and more on Reddit of  same issue . Car wouldn’t go more than 5mph extremely traumatic on highway my son won’t get back in the car he is too scared.
After parking the car says I need to shift the car into park even though it is.
On [XXX] I was driving to work and my check engine light came on. Immediately after this I was completely unable to brake. My brake pedal became so stiff and impossible to press. I very narrowly avoided an accident. I had the car towed to an auto shop where I was informed that I had a vacuum pump failure that essentially exploded and destroyed my cam shaft and shot fragments of metal into my engine in the process. I was quoted over $12,000 in repairs.  After receiving this quote I began searching online to find what could have caused this to happen. I stumbled upon a class action lawsuit for this EXACT same thing (plaintiff [XXX] ). In addition to the suit there were 12 PAGES of comments from other Malibu owners who have experienced similar issues with their vacuum pump and braking system. This issue is also noted on MANY car repair forums, Chevy owner forums, YouTube repair videos etc.   Please note that when I received the check engine light on 9/5 this is the first and only time I had any indication of a potential problem with my vehicle. In the year and a half that I have owned the car there has never been any issues, warnings or check engine lights.

Electrical issue , Continuously losing communication to EBCM causing the car to go haywire with warning lamps on the dash board and then it brakes on its own , while driving on the highway at high speeds. This is very scary and extremely dangerous and this could eventually cause a serious accident. This has been occurring for 3 months now. I’ve had the car serviced 3 times within the last 3 months , costing me a lot of money but with no real resolution. Problem has been confirmed by independent Mechanics , they stated the codes are a loss of communication to all control modules , they then reset / reprogram modules , which is only a temporary fix because it always happens again.

VEHICLE SEEMS TO WANT TO STALL OUT FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN PRESSING THE GAS
Hello , in January 18,2024 I’ve purchased a 2021 Chevrolet Malibu from Toyota of Dallas on Forest Lane. Within the first 24 hours I got a flat due to a bad tire , but was informed they did a full inspection before giving me the car . I contacted my sales representative she informed me to to bring the vehicle up there once they were open to see if they could resolved the issue due to me paying for a new tire. Once arrived they stated they could not compensate because I bought a tire somewhere else . Within 48 days of having the vehicle , I contacted them sale representative which I still have messages the my vehicle is saying “shift to park” while in park . They stated that it could just be a “sensor” used to bring it . Once I brought it in the car was not doing it & they informed me theirs nothing they can do unless the car does it again when I bring it . The car ends up doing it again I contact them my sale person no longer work there so I disclose this issue with another sales person , which no one documented but I have the messages to prove I informed them. I brought the car up there again & one of the technicians informed me “ just push your gear shift forward a little & it will just turn off”. So I did so & it worked but not for long . My car kept continuously doing it afterwards & they suggested to bring it in for diagnostic , however they way my schedule is at the probation office I work Monday - Friday & that is my only transportation to work or my schedule would not align . So on December 3,2024 my check engine light comes on in the vehicle while driving home . I immediately took my car to the Auto Zone on Buckner which I also have the paperwork for their diagnostic suggest cleaning the throttle bottle & also code P1101. I notice on the paper it stated my car would not pass a inspection with those code & said transmission status - red . I immediately set me appointment for 12/04/24 to take my car to the dealership. I took my car there they stated I arrived
When trying to park shift disappears . Parking feature unavailable. Have to try several times to or wait until parking shift appears. System glitch trying to park. Afraid car will run off by itself and hit other cars and crash. Family of four very concerned for our safety. It has been a known issue on several Chevrolet Malibu since 2015 This should have been on a recall since 2015. Why haven’t there been any recalls on this vehicle for this problem. This problem needs to get resolved and if we have to pay out of pocket money reimbursed for everyone. Fear for our safety using this car now.
When you put my 2022 Chevy Malibu in park and turn the engine off the display states the vehicle is not in park. This does not go away and power stays on to the car.
The car is telling me to shift to park when it's in park and just turned it off. I have to start the car again and move the gear shift from park to drive and back to try to clear it. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't.
My transmission is jerking and slipping. When accelerating the car acts like it doesn’t want to go. When I take ,my foot off the gas pedal the transmission jerks hard. The car has had the original transmission replaced by Beaver Chevy and now the new transmission is having the same issue. The car never had any check engine lights or any lights come on.
Today my 16 year old daughter drove my 2010 Nissan Altima. At 45 mph it started to jerk. She pulled over to check things out and saw nothing. She went to put it back in drive and the gear shifter wouldn’t stay in proper drive position, but she started driving. It continued and began jerking, making a popping sound, and then started pouring smoke. She pulled over, got out and got my 10 year old daughter out when she saw a flame by the windshield and they ran away from the vehicle before it became engulfed in flames very quickly. The entire vehicle is ash except the frame in a short period of time.
The airbag lights came on and when I took it to Nissan, I was told that it will not deploy if a person was to get in an accident
ERROR CODES THROUGH SENSOR WARNINGS, I REPLACE ONE SENSOR NOW ANOTHER SENSOR ERROR. I'M ABOUT 1000.00 IN REPLACING ELECTRICIAL ISSUES AND MECHANIC SAYS THE CAR IS HAVING ELECTRICAL ISSUES AND HE CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT. CAR WON'T RUN LONGER THAN 30 MINS. REPLACED CRANK SHAFT SENSOR AND APP SENSOR.
MY DASHBOARD HAS MELTED AND IT CAUSES FOR THE INSIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD  TO BUILD A FILM. ITS DIFFICULT TO CLEAN AND I HAVE TO CLEAN I AT LEAST ONCE A DAY. THE GLARE OFF THE MELTED DASH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SEE OUTSIDE. I HAVE INCLUDED SOME PICTURES OF THE DAMAGE.
MY ENGINE IS MAKING A KNOCKING SOUND WHEN ACCELARATING AND IT HAS EXCESSIVE BLOWBY WITH CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON SAYING CATALYTIC CONVERTER ,EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF OIL GETTING PAST MY PVC SYSTEM  IT ONLY HAS 129880 MILES ON IT
THE DASH IS MELTING AND STICKY, CAUSING IT TO BE SHINY. THIS CREATES A GLARE ON THE WINDSHIELD AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE, CAUSING A SEVERE SAFETY HAZARD.
THE INCIDENT HAPPENED THE WEEK OF 02/08/18 MY WIFE NOTICED SOME LIGHT VDC SLIP ABS LIGHTS ALL CAME ON THEM WHILE ON HIGHWAY ALL OF THE BRAKES LOCKED AND SHE COULD NOT ACCELERATE CAR.
PAINT CHIPPED OFF AND FADED AFTER ONE YEAR. HAVE SEEN NUMEROUS NISSANS WITH SAME ISSUE. NISSAN REFUSES TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OR REPRINT ANY FADED NISSAN.
MY 19 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING HER CAR DOWN THE ROAD WHEN IT STOPPED ACCELERATING ACTING AS IF THE BRAKES WERE APPLIED.  SHE COULD NOT GET THE CAR TO GO ABOVE 25 MILES AN HOUR.  SHE WAS ABLE TO PULL INTO A PARKING LOT AND WAIT FOR HER DAD TO COME AND HELP HER.  WHEN HER DAD GOT THERE THE CAR WAS SLUGGISH AND WOULD NOT ACCELERATE BECAUSE IT FELT LIKE THE BRAKES WERE BEING APPLIED.  HE SWITCHED THE CAR TO MANUAL AND WAS ABLE TO GET IT HOME.  THE ABS, VDC OFF, SLIP LIGHTS ALL CAME ON.  THE NEXT DAY ALL LIGHTS WERE OFF AND THE CAR DROVE NORMALLY.  THIS HAPPENED TWO MORE TIMES INTERMITTENTLY AT WHICH TIME WE TOOK IT INTO OUR MECHANIC.  HE DISCOVERED A POWER BRAKE BOOSTER NEEDED REPLACING.  HE BELIEVED THIS WAS A SAFETY RECALL AS IT HAD BEEN A RECALL ON THE 2007, 2008 AND 2009 NISSAN ALTIMA.  MUCH TO OUR DISMAY NISSAN HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL FOR THIS SAFETY ISSUE FOR THE 2010 MODELS.  MY MECHANIC TOLD US THIS WAS DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY NISSAN.
THE PASSENGER AIRBAG SENSOR HAS MALFUNCTION WHICH CAUSED THE INDICATION LIGHT FLASHING. THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP DIAGNOSTIC THE PROBLEM AND THE RESULT WAS TO REPLACE THE PASSENGER SEAT. SINCE IT WAS THE AIRBAG SENSOR MALFUNCTION, IT WILL AFFECT THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE AIRBAG IF ACCIDENT HAPPENS. THIS IS NOT A WEAR & TEAR ISSUE. IT IS THE MANUFACTURING PROBLEM.  I AM AWARE THAT LATER MODELS OF NISSAN'S VEHICLE HAVE BEEN RECALLED FOR THE SAME ISSUE, NISSAN CORPORATION REFUSED TO REPLACE THE SEAT AT THEIR COST SINCE THIS PARTICULAR MODEL WAS NOT IN THEIR RECALL LIST.
ON AUGUST 17, 2015 I NOTICED THAT MY AIR BAG LIGHT WAS FLASHING IN MY 2010 NISSAN ALTIMA COUPE 3.5..  THE NEXT DAY I WENT TO MY DEALERSHIP TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT.  THEY INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS A "SHORT' IN THE STEERING WHEEL AIRBAG MEANING THAT THE AIRBAG WOULD NOT DEPLOY IF NEEDED. I CONTACTED NISSAN WITH MY CONCERN ABOUT THE SHORT BEING A DEFECT WITH ONLY 58,133 MILES ON THE CAR.  AIRBAGS SHOULD NOT HAVE "SHORTS" IN THEM FOR DEPLOYMENT!!!  AFTER 2 WEEKS THEY OFFERED TO PAY FOR 1/2 OF THE COST OF THE REPLACEMENT OF THE AIRBAG.  THIS INDICATED TO ME THAT THEY REALIZED THERE WAS A DEFECT WITH THE AIRBAG.  I FELT THAT THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAT JUST 1/2 HALF OF THE COST.  THEY FELT DIFFERENT. I WAS LEFT WITH NO CHOICE BUT TO ACCEPT THEIR OFFER OR DRIVE WITH A DEFECTIVE AIRBAG OR PAY THE FULL COST OF THE REPLACEMENT. THIS WAS THE 2ND PROBLEM I HAD WITH AN AIRBAG WITH THE CAR.  THEY COVERED THE COST THE 1ST AIRBAG. CONSIDERING THE PROBLEMS WITH AIRBAGS IN NISSAN CARS, I FEEL THIS MIGHT BE ANOTHER PROBLEM FOR NISSAN THAT THEY DO NOT FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE.  I AM CURIOUS IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER NISSAN ALTIMA OWNERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING WHEEL AIRBAG.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 NISSAN ALTIMA. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 30 MPH, THE VEHICLE SLID ON A PATCH OF ICE. THE CONTACT LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE AND CRASHED INTO A SNOW PILE. THE DRIVER'S SEAT BELT FAILED TO REMAIN LATCHED UPON IMPACT AND THE CONTACT STRUCK HER HEAD ON THE STEERING WHEEL. A POLICE REPORT WAS NOT FILED. THE CONTACT SUSTAINED BLURRY VISION TO THE LEFT EYE, FACIAL BRUISING, AND A CERVICAL SPRAIN THAT REQUIRED MEDICAL ATTENTION. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 43,000.
NISSAN ALTIMA 2010 (~25K MILES SO FAR) WOULD NOT START UPON PRESS THE START BUTTON, SO THE CAR IS IMMOBILIZED. WALKED AWAY, CAME BACK 15 MINUTES, AND BY CHANCE, IT STARTED. THIS HAPPEN SEVERAL TIMES FOR THE PAST 2 MONTHS. THE LAST TRY, NO SUCH LUCK WHEN ATTEMPT TO START THE CAR. CHECK THE CAR BATTERY WAS AT 45%. SO I CHARGED THE BATTERY TO 100% AND STILL NO LUCK STARTING THE CAR. CALL NISSANASSIST AND RECOMMENDED THE CAR BE TOWED TO NISSAN AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTER. I DID AND THEIR DIAGNOSIS ($119.00) ARE A BAD BRAKE SWITCH/WIRING HARNESS COMBO ISSUE AND COST ABOUT OVER $600.00. THE CAR IS NOW OUT OF WARRANTY. THE LOCAL SERVICE MANAGER SAID "OFF THE RECORD", THIS KNOWN DEFECTIVE BRAKE SWITCH WILL NOT ALLOW THE CAR TO START, ALSO IT IS CONSUMING THE BATTERY ELECTRICAL CURRENT AND OVER TIME. THIS CONTINUOUS BLEEDING OF CURRENT WILL HEAT UP THE WIRE HARNESS/CONNECTORS DUE TO THE CAR STARTING AND ITS SECURITY FEATURES, AND THUS EVENTUALLY DRAINING YOUR CAR BATTERY AND DAMAGING THE WIRE HARNESS. THAT IS WHY YOU WILL HAVE A DEAD BATTERY OVER TIME OF 1-2 WEEKS. THIS IS A MONEY MAKING PROPOSITION FOR NISSAN CORPORATION AND THE LOCAL SERVICE PERSON MENTIONED ABOUT A RASH OF BAD SWITCH OCCURRENCES LAST YEAR (2013). IN SHORT, IF YOU DON'T USE THE NISSAN SERVICE DEPARTMENT FOR YOUR CAR AND SPEND $$$ WITH THEM, THE NISSANASSIST WON'T HELP YOU DEFRAY THE COST FOR THE CAR DEFECTIVE AS YOU DID NOT "INVEST" WITH THEM .SO NHTSA, PEOPLE WON'T DIE WITH THIS DEFECTIVE, BUT WILL CAUSE MANY INCONVENIENCES WITH DEAD CARS AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS WHERE DRIVERS TURN OFF THEIR CARS AND FRUSTRATED ON ATTEMPTING TO START THEIR CARS. THIS IS THE SAME PROBLEM NOTED ON NISSAN BLOG AND WEBSITES BY FRUSTRATED NISSAN ALTIMA OWNERS. IN SUMMARY, CAN NHTSA INVESTIGATED AND FORCE NISSAN TO ISSUE A RECALL FOR THIS RECURRING PROBLEM AS NO ONE DIE YET?  YES, NO ONE WILL DIE FROM THIS.     *TR
DURING A ROUTINE SERVICE I WAS TOLD THAT THE SHOCK ABSORBERS WERE IN NEED OF REPLACEMENT. SINCE THIS IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE CAR IN TERMS OF STABILITY AND SINCE THERE WAS ONLY 39000 MILES ON THE CAR I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKELY A FAULT IN MANUFACTURE. I AM A SENIOR CITIZEN AND ONLY DRIVE ON WELL PAVED ROADS AND HIGHWAYS. I DO NOT PULL A TRAILER OR THE LIKE. I CONTACTED NISSAN ABOUT THIS BUT THEY DECLINED TO TAKE ACTION. I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS MIGHT REPRESENT A SAFETY HAZARD FOR OTHERS WHO MAY NOT HAVE THIS DEFECT DISCOVERED.  *TR

AFTER DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS FOR SEVERAL HOURS , THEN EXITING AND COMING TO A FULL STOP, THE AUTO WILL BARELY MOVE IN DRIVE OR REVERSE WHEN GIVEN GAS. THIS HAS CREATED A DANGEROUS SITUATION FOR ME WHEN CARS COME UP BEHIND AND EXPECT ME TO PULL OUT. I CAN ONLY GO AT 2-5 MPH UNTIL THE CVT TRANSMISSION FINALLY ALLOWS THE CAR TO GO AT NORMAL SPEED LEVELS. NISSAN SERVICE ADVISOR IN FLORIDA, MY DESTINATION, TOLD ME IT WAS A " COMPUTER GLITCH"  WHERE THE COMPUTER WAS FOOLED INTO BELIEVING THE CAR WAS STILL IN HIGHWAY SPEED GEAR AND WHICH HAD NO FIX.  *KB
2010 NISSAN ALTIMA, APPROXIMATELY 9500 MILES. CAR WAS PARKED IN DRIVEWAY IN THE EVENING, FIRST VERY COLD NIGHT OF THE YEAR, ABOUT 10 DEGREES. WHEN I ENTERED CAR AT APPROXIMATELY 8AM THE NEXT MORNING, THE PASSENGER'S SIDE WINDOW HAD COMPLETELY SHATTERED. THE WINDOW WAS STILL WHOLE, NO AREAS PUSHED IN, JUST FULLY SPIDERED WITH CRACKS, BUT STILL IN PLACE. UPON INSPECTION, IT JUST COLLAPSED INTO AND OUTSIDE OF THE CAR. CAR WAS IN PRIVATE LOCATION, NO CHANCE THAT IT WAS HIT OR OTHERWISE IMPACTED. MUST HAVE BEEN MFG DEFECT. DEALERSHIP NO HELP, DIRECTED TO CONTACT INSURANCE, NISSAN CUSTOMER SERVICE NO HELP, JUST CONTACT INSURANCE. *TR

The contact owns a 2011 Nissan Altima. The contact stated that while driving at an unknown speed, the vehicle inadvertently decelerated. The contact stated that the vehicle performed as if the gear shifter was in neutral(N). The check engine warning light was illuminated. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. Neither the dealer nor the manufacture was notified of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 100,000.
MY VEHICLE HAS A VERY SHINY, STICKY AND MELTING DASHBOARD.  THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR APPROXIMATELY 3 YEARS AND HAS BEEN GETTING PROGRESSIVELY WORSE. I CONTACTED NISSAN AND THEY SAID IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY (3 YEARS, 36000 MILES) AND I'M ON MY OWN AND THEY CANNOT HELP ME. THIS IS A BIG SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE THE SHINE PRODUCES A GLARE ALL OVER MY WINDSHIELD AND MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE DRIVING IN THE SUNLIGHT.   PLEASE HELP!!
SUDDEN LOSS OF POWER AFTER DRIVING AN HOUR AND A HALF.  TRANSMISSION GOES IN TO FAIL/SAFE MODE AND LEAVES ME ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. DEALER SOLD IT TO ME WITH THIS SAFETY ISSUE.
THE DASHBOURD HAS BEEN MELTING AND HAS BECOME STICKY FOR THE PAST 2 YEARS
WENT TO START MY CAR.IN THE DASHBOARD WAS A KEY LIGHT.CAR WOULDN'T START LOOK UP THINGS THAT COULD BE THE PROBLEM SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT STEERING LOCK.THE CAR WAS SITTING AT MY HOUSE .
I'M HAVING ISSUES WITH MY TRANSMISSION THAT ARE MOST LIKELY LEADING TO IT NEEDING TO BE REPLACED AND AFTER DOING FURTHER RESEARCH IT SEEMS THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WITH THE EXACT SAME MAKE AND MODEL AND A LOT WITH THE SAME YEAR OR ONLY A FEW YEARS DIFFERENCE THAT HAVE HAD THE EXACT SAME ISSUE. WITH THIS MANY PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME ISSUES I THINK NISSAN NEEDS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.
AT 93,000 MILES THE TRANSMISSION FAILED AND HAD TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $3,700.  THE ONLY REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION COST MORE THAN $2,500 IS SOLD BY NISSAN AND ONLY COMES WITH A 12 MONTH WARRANTY.  THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.  WHY DOES THE 120,000 MILE WARRANTY STOP WITH THE 2010 MODEL WHEN THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS IN THE MODELS AFTER 2010?
I HAVE A 2011 NISSAN ALTIMA COUPE WITH 61K MILES AND THE DASH IS MELTING AND THEIRS A GLAIR ON MY WINDSHIELD AND I'VE ALMOST GOTTEN IN TO A WRECK SEVERAL TIMES DUE TO THE SUN IN FLORIDA AND THE GLAIR NISSAN WON'T HELP WITH THE 2K BILL TO REPLACE THE DASH
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 NISSAN ALTIMA. WHILE DRIVING AT VARIOUS SPEEDS, THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WAS DEPRESSED AND THERE WAS A LOUD RATTLING NOISE AND VIBRATION COMING FROM THE VEHICLE. THE FAILURE RECURRED NUMEROUS TIMES. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO A DEALER BUT WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE AND STATED THAT THE VIN WAS NOT INCLUDED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 11V371000 (SUSPENSION). THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 33,000.
WHILE DRIVING IN CITY TRAFFIC, THE CAR STARTED TO STALL.  DRIVER PARKED THE CAR ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND WALKED TO WORK TO AVOID HAVING THE CAR DIE IN A BUSY INTERSECTION.  NONE OF THE DASHBOARD WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON TO INDICATE A PROBLEM.    WHEN ATTEMPTING TO RETRIEVE THE CAR THAT EVENING, IT COULD NOT BE STARTED AND HAD TO BE TOWED TO A MECHANIC.    DESPITE BEING ONLY 3-YEARS OLD AND HAVING GONE JUST 60,022 MILES, THE MECHANIC DISCOVERED THAT THE CAR HAD A CRACKED ENGINE BLOCK!    THE ENGINE HAD BEEN WELL MAINTAINED INCLUDING OIL CHANGES EVERY 3,000 MILES.  *TR
2011 NISSAN ALTIMA. CONSUMER STATES PROBLEM WITH STARTING VEHICLE *TGW  THE CONSUMER STATED HE WAS UNABLE TO UNLOCK ANY OF THE DOORS, A MESSAGE INDICATED THE DOOR WAS OPEN, BUT IT WAS TIGHTLY CLOSED. THE CONSUMER HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED. THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER NOTICED THE FAN WAS RUNNING. A DIAGNOSIS AT THE DEALER REVEALED A COMPUTER GLITCH.
The vehicle is unsafe to driver and others on the road. The power steering hose has had a leak since it was manufactured and was not fixed by the manufacturer at all! Tie rods gave away within 5 years of a mileage less than 24,200 miles. Cv joints along with tie rods  have been easily compromised and damaged causing loss of control and steering .suspensions are no longer in tact nor reliable and will pose a danger. All errors were not found by manufacturer and has caused immediate danger to not only driver but everyone on the road. The engine has a rattle only after 2 years which is not usual.
Transmission spudders at times. It is very delayed when pulling out sometimes. Turning the car off and back on might help sometimes. Car will go in limp mode. Nissan dealer said it was the Transmission. There is a big safety concern because when you push the gas trying to cross an intersection, it might lag behind and not go. This could result in being hit. This has been a great car but the cat is complete junk and Nissan should be ashamed of themselves for this. If they get enough law suits they may change something. Well maybe, They don't care about peoples lives.
While driving at 70mph on interstate the hood flew open with no known explanation as to why as hood had not been opened by anyone in the last 120 days prior to incident.   This caused hood to snap back, strike and smash windshield and significantly dent roof of car in front of moonroof.
MY 2012 NISSAN ALTIMA 2.5 SL CUT OFF WHILE I WAS DRIVING YESTERDAY.  I WAS GOING ABOUT 15 MPH AND MAKING A RIGHT TURN WHEN THE CAR CUT OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TURN.  THERE WERE NO WARNING LIGHTS BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER THE INCIDENT.  I WAS ABLE TO COAST INTO THE PARKING LOT WHERE I RESTARTED THE CAR.  THERE WAS  OF A TANK OF GAS IN THE CAR AND ALL OF THE BATTERY CABLES WERE SECURE.  I HAD THE BATTERY AND ALTERNATOR CHECKED AND BOTH WERE FINE.  THERE ARE 76,979 MILES ON THE CAR.  THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS EVER HAPPENED, HOWEVER, AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH I HAVE LEARNED THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE.  I HAVE LOVED DRIVING THIS CAR FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS, BUT NOW I AM AFRAID THIS WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN AND COULD CAUSE ME TO LOSE MY LIFE IN A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT.  PLEASE ADVISE ME OF YOUR OFFICIAL RECOMMENDATION AS TO HOW I SHOULD PROCEED.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 NISSAN ALTIMA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE DASHBOARD WAS MELTED AND STICKY WITH AN ABNORMAL ODOR COMING FROM THE DASHBOARD. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THERE WAS A GLARE IN THE WINDSHIELD FROM THE DASHBOARD WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT TO SEE WHILE DRIVING. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO SUTHERLIN NISSAN LOCATED AT 8125 E. COLONIAL DR, ORLANDO, FL 32817, WHERE THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT INCLUDED IN A RECALL. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE BUT PROVIDED NO ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 40,000.
AFTER 43K MILES AIR BAG LIGHT ILLUMINATES WHEN MY WIFE IS SEATED AND CAR IS BEING DRIVEN. DEALER SAYS WEIGHT REQUIREMENT FOR PASSENGER IS 120 LBS. WHAT IS FEDERAL REQUIREMENT?
WHEN DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY THE CAR WILL DROP FROM 70 TO BELOW 40 MPH, CANNOT MAINTAIN A SAFE SPEED ON HIGHWAY. PROBLEM IS EXASPERATED WHEN DRIVING UP A HILL. THE ISSUE IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. THERE IS ALSO A WHIRRING NOISE THE ENGINE MAKES WHEN THIS HAPPENS. AFTER CHECKING ONLINE FORUMS IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM/COMPLAINT AMONG OTHER NISSAN ALTIMA 2012 MODELS.
I BOUGHT MY CAR ONLY A FEW MONTHS AGO AND RECENTLY TAKING IT TO THE BENCH AT THEIR SERVICE, THE TECHNICIANS NOTIFIED ME THAT I HAD A LEAK AND THE GASCKET ENGINE OIL COOLER NEED TO BE REPLACED AFTER THAT I'VE BEEN SEARCHING THE INTERNET ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND I FOUND IT S A VERY COMMON FAULT IN THIS MODEL, MANY OWNERS REPORT THIS PROBLEM AND EVERYONE WONDERS WHY THERE IS NO RECALL YET
NO FORVER GEAR OR REVERSE GEAR AT ALL .AND HAVE ALOT OF CODE 720 1723 1778 0868 0715 1722 0746 0826 1701
I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN MY TRANSMISSION MISFIRED- MY VEHICLE LOST POWER AND WENT FLAT AT 60MPH. I WAS NOT ABLE TO ACCELERATE ABOVE 60MPH FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TRIP AND THE CAR VIBRATED EXCESSIVELY QUITE A BIT.
O HILLS AND ON WARM DAYS THE CAR LOSSES POWER AND WONT GO OVER 60 MPH THIS HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY AND ALMOST CUASED A WRECK.  THIS HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES.  ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND THE CODE SAID IT WAS LOW ON FLUID.  IT WAS CHECKED AND WAS GOOD.
THE VEHICLE'S DOORS STOPPED LOCKING AND UNLOCKING PROPERLY. IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT ALL 4 DOOR LOCKS HAVE THE SAME ISSUE, WHERE THEY LOCK SOMETIMES AND AT OTHER TIMES, THEY DON'T. THE ALARM SYSTEM IS DOING STRANGE THINGS, ALSO. BY THAT, I MEAN THERE WILL BE TIMES WHEN I PRESS THE DOOR BUTTON AND HEAR THE DOUBLE-BEEP, INSTEAD OF THE SINGLE-BEEP THAT WOULD UNLOCK THE BUTTON. AS I OPEN THE DOOR, I EXPECT THE ALARM TO GO OFF, AS I ASSUME THE ALARM SYSTEM BELIEVES THE DOOR IS NOW LOCKED. HOWEVER, THE DOOR WILL OPEN, THE ALARM WON'T GO OFF, THEN THE WARNING BEEPS WILL SOUND AS THE DOOR IS CLOSED, MAKING THE BEEPING WARNING SOUND ASSOCIATED WITH ATTEMPTING TO LOCK THE VEHICLE WITH YOUR KEYS STILL INSIDE. THIS IS CLEARLY A FACTORY ISSUE FOR NISSAN, BUT IT IS A SAFETY CONCERN, AS THE LOCK IS AN ADDED MEASURE OF SECURITY FOR KIDS AND SAFETY WITHIN A VEHICLE. IF MY WIFE WOULD EVER FEEL THE NEED TO HIT THE LOCKS, FOR WHATEVER REASON SHE ENCOUNTERS, WE CAN'T KNOW FOR SURE THEY WILL OPERATE PROPERLY.
ACCELERATOR PEDAL CAME OFF MOUNT WHILE DRIVING, NO BOLTS HOLDING PEDAL IN PLACE. I HAD TO BEND DOWN TO ADJUST PEDAL WHILE DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE TO GET SAFETY OFF THE ROAD.   I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY NOTIFICATION OF A RECALL TO THE DEFECT. I TOOK MY CAR TO THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP IN HUNTSVILLE TO HAVE THE CAR INSPECTED AND REPAIRED.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT FOUND NO BOLTS ON THE PEDAL ASSEMBLY.  I WAS CHARGED $59.94 FOR THE SERVICE AND REPAIR.   ON A RELATED NOTE...IRONICALLY I TOOK CARE OF A PATIENT IN THE ER LAST WEEK WHO WAS IN AN ACCIDENT INVOLVING THEIR NISSAN 2006 VEHICLE. WHILE TURNING INTO THEIR DRIVEWAY, THE ACCELERATOR STUCK AND THE CAR JETTED FORWARD AND RAN INTO THEIR TREE. THEIR CHILD, SITTING IN THE BACKSEAT, RESTRAINED,  STRUCK HER HEAD ON THE SIDE WINDOW AND SUFFERED A LACERATION TO HER TEMPLE REGION THAT REQUIRED SUTURING.  I GAVE THE PATIENT'S MOTHER THIS WEBSITE TO FOLLOW UP WITH HER COMPLAINT.
JUST PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE USED AND NOTICED ON THE TEST DRIVE THE PASSENGER SEAT AIRBAG LIGHT WAS LIT UP INDICATING IT WAS OFF, EVEN THOUGH SOMEONE WAS IN THE SEAT. BROUGHT IT TO THEIR ATTENTION, 5 MINUTES LATER THEY BROUGHT IT BACK CLAIMING IT NEEDED RESET DUE TO A SENSOR HAVING SOMETHING TO DO WITH A CARSEAT. THE LIGHT WASN'T ON WITH A PASSENGER SO I ASSUMED IT WAS FINE.  NOW THE LIGHT BRIEFLY ILLUMINATES AT START UP, BUT STAYS OFF REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE IS IN THE SEAT. I HAVE SEEN ABOUT 20 OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THIS ISSUE AND IT IS VERY UNSAFE, I NOW HAVE ZERO FAITH THAT THE AIRBAG WILL EVEN DEPLOY. NEEDS TO BE RECALLED!!
MY VEHICLE WOULD NOT GO FORWARD WHEN PRESSING ON THE GAS PEDAL. IT WOULD NOT GO PAST 40 MPH ON THE EXPRESSWAY. AFTER 20 MINUTES IN TRAFFIC IS WHEN THE CHECK SERVICE ENGINE CAME ON. I HAD IT DIAGNOSED AT A TRANSMISSION SHOP AND THE CODE REFLECTED THE CVT TRANSMISSION. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH A NISSAN DEALERSHIP TO CHECK OUT THE DIAGNOSIS...WILL UPDATE DOCUMENTS LATER.
AFTER DRIVING AT 70 MPH FOR SEVERAL HOURS, THE VEHICLE WILL NO LONGER ACCELERATE AND SLOWS DOWN. THE VEHICLE NEEDS TO SIT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE IT IS ABLE TO ACCELERATE AGAIN. THIS ISSUE HAD OCCURRED BEFORE 8K MILES EARLIER AND HAD THE CVT COOLER REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY.
ON THE ABOVE DATE, MY VEHICLE WAS INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT WHICH AFTER THOROUGH ASSESSMENT BY THE BODY SHOP AND BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY'S FIELD ADJUSTERS, WAS DEEMED A TOTAL LOSS. MY VEHICLE'S STEERING SUDDENLY BECAME VERY DIFFICULT DUE TO THE FRONT WHEELS BECOMING SEEMINGLY LOCKED AND STEERING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WAS IMPOSSIBLE. STEERING WHEEL WAS EXTREMELY HARD TO TURN AS WELL. THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY EITHER. EVERYTHING HAPPENED SO FAST. THERE WAS A LOSS OF CONTROL WHICH CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO OVERTURN OR "FLIP". THE VEHICLE WAS STILL UPSIDE DOWN WHEN PASSERSBY AND LAW OFFICIAL ARRIVED.THIS ACCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF WE'D RECEIVED PRIOR NOTIFICATION. WE KNOW THERE WERE RECALLS FOR THIS YEAR,MAKE AND MODEL VEHICLE AND THOSE SIMILAR, HOWEVER WE WERE NEVER NOTIFIED BY ANYONE OF SAID RECALLS.THIS ACCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN FATAL, THAT'S HOW BAD IT WAS.BY THE GRACE OF GOD IT WASN'T.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 NISSAN ALTIMA. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 35 MPH, THE VEHICLE STALLED WITHOUT WARNING. AFTER WAITING FOR A FEW MOMENTS, THE VEHICLE RESTARTED AND RESUMED NORMAL OPERATION. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE ISSUE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 52,000. THE VIN WAS UNAVAILABLE.
THE HOOD RELEASE ON THESE CARS IS DOWN UNDER THE DASH, WHERE IT CAN EASILY BE PULLED WITH THE TOE OF YOUR SHOE.  IT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE, BUT MY WIFE WAS OUTSIDE OF THE CAR AND HEARD IT POP.  THIS DAY, WE WERE ON OUR WAY HOME FROM CHURCH.  MADE IT ALL THE WAY ONTO THE HIGHWAY AND REACHED 70 MPH, SPEED LIMIT ON THAT HIGHWAY IS 75 MPH.  THE HOOD FLEW UP, DAMAGING THE WINDSHIELD, ROOF, HOOD, FENDERS AND HOOD HINGES.  THIS IS VERY DISTURBING THAT THE 2013'S ARE BEING RECALLED WHEN THE DESIGN IS THE SAME FROM 2012 TO 2014 THAT I AM AWARE OF.  WE HAVE BEEN WARNING OTHER DRIVERS OF THIS DANGER.  I HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR 30 YEARS AND HAVE EMERGENCY VEHICLE TO 18 WHEELER TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE.  NOT EVERYONE WILL BE SO LUCKY.  *TR
WHEN I TRY TO START THE CAR, THE POWER COMES ON(RADIO COMES ON, DASHBOARD LIGHTS), BUT THE IGNITION DOESN'T START. THE CAR HAS LESS THAN 15K MILES ON IT.  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA (N/A). THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE HEADREST CAUSED THE CONTACT BACK PAIN, HEAD ACHES AND NUMBNESS IN THE ARM. THE CONTACT TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALER WHERE THE DEALER TURNED THE HEAD REST AROUND. THE CONTACT STATED THAT AFTER THE HEAD REST WAS TURNED, THERE WAS NO MORE PAIN. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 1,000.
Heard a loud pop noise from the rear of the car while backing up, steering was unstable while driving. Looked under the car and discover the right rear control arm is broken.
The headlights has a recall but the dealership told me if the previous owner didn't fix it, it didn't do me any justice.  I have to drive with bright lights on at night because the headlights are pointed at the ground but not up ahead to see what's in front of me. It's very hard to see. I haven't had the car a year and I really love my car. The $1,600 to fix, is what the Nissian dealership in my town quoted me. I am a single mom with elementary aged kids, driving them to school, it's still little dark.
The lights are positioned too low to the ground and they are not bright enough. I end up having to keep my high lights on when driving at night because the visibility is very poor otherwise. Dangerous

This vehicle has never been in an accident and the driver air bag light came on. Per dealer it was the air bag modular and the who driver seat. Needed to be replaced. I called Nissan and they wouldn’t cover the replacement, because this part is only covered up to 50,000 miles.  I’m very concerned and disappointed this is a safety hazard and should have been covered we are talking about air bag which saves lives. While in the dealership getting my car repaired another customer came in with the same issue.  Can you please investigate Nissan before the faulty air bag modular they are placing on their cars? I can see the part going out on vehicles involved in accidents , it doesn’t make sense on non-accident vehicles.

The manufacturer was made aware of the failure but informed the contact that recall repair was only performed one time free of charge. The failure mileage was 108,000.
1. The vehicle component that failed was the transmission. The manner in which it failed was total, rendering the vehicle unable to move under its own power. This failure occurred while moving in traffic on a heavily trafficked divided highway.    2. The driver and other occupant of the vehicle were put at great personal risk by being in a disabled vehicle amidst surrounding traffic moving at 40-60 MPH. Occupants of an additional vehicle that stopped behind the disabled vehicle were also put at great personal risk for the same reason. Law enforcement officers who arrived to assist were required to block multiple lanes of oncoming traffic with their duty vehicles. These law enforcement officers were further put at risk by having to push the disabled vehicle 100+ yards through traffic at the aforementioned speeds before it could be safely moved off the roadway. Passing motorists were at great risk of colliding with the disabled vehicle throughout the incident. The total duration of the disabled vehicle being stuck in traffic as described was in excess of 15 minutes. Due to luck and the actions of law enforcement officers, no injuries or fatalities resulted.     3.  This mechanical failure  has been diagnosed by both independent and manufacturer certified dealer repair shops.  4.T he vehicle has  been inspected by the manufacturers authorized service representative, the dealer.  Law  enforcement officers assisted in recovering the vehicle  and  confirmed it was disabled.  Insurance representatives have not yet inspected the  vehicle.   5. There were no warnings or any other sort of indication from the vehicle prior to complete and total failure of the transmission.  The vehicle  has been properly maintained per manufacturer specifications and is under the mileage at  which any reasonable motorist would expect a total failure of this component.  6. After being notified of the above, manufacturer refuses to repair vehicle with a safe transmission.
REAR, LOWER CONTROL ARM THAT CONNECTS REAR WHEEL TO VEHICLE BROKE WHILE DRIVING, NEARLY CAUSING A CRASH.  AND NISSAN IS REFUSING TO COVER THE EXPENSE OF THE REPAIR EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE WELL AWARE OF THE ISSUE!  (SEE NISSAN'S SERVICE BULLETIN P9324).  NISSAN NEED'S TO BE HELP ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS DEFECTIVE PART.  COMPLETE LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE IS VERY LIKELY, ESPECIALLY AT HIGH SPEEDS.
LOW BEAM HEADLIGHT IS VERY LOW AND UNABLE TO SEE . CHANGED MANY BULBS AND STILL SAME .
THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHT OUTPUT IS SO TERRIBLE I HAVE TO USE MY HIGH BEAMS AT DUSK OR NIGHT IN ORDER TO SEE.  THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD FOR MYSELF AND OTHER DRIVERS.  NISSAN NEEDS TO ADDRESS AND FIX THIS PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY!  I RAN INTO A POTHOLE RUINING MY TIRE AND RIM BECAUSE I COULD THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH LIGHT OUTPUT FOR ME TO SEE
WHILE DRIVING WITH HEADLIGHTS ON THERE IS VERY LOW VISIBILITY, IT ALMOST APPEARS THE HEADLIGHTS ARE NOT ON AT ALL. WHEN SWITCHING TO THE HIGH BEAMS THEY APPEAR TO NOT BE AS BRIGHT AS NORMAL EITHER. THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM THAT I FEAR COULD LEAD TO A COLLISION DUE TO VERY LOW VISIBILITY.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING AT VARIOUS SPEEDS, A RATTLING SOUND WAS PRESENT COMING FROM THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE.

THE CONTACT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 20V315000 (LATCHES/LOCKS/LINKAGES) HOWEVER, THE PART TO DO THE RECALL REPAIR WAS NOT YET AVAILABLE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE MANUFACTURER HAD EXCEEDED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THE RECALL REPAIR. AN UNKNOWN DEALER WAS CONTACTED AND CONFIRMED THAT PARTS WERE NOT YET AVAILABLE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE ISSUE. THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE. VIN TOOL CONFIRMS PARTS NOT AVAILABLE.
MY NISSAN ALTIMA 2013 HEADLIGHTS ARE SO POOR THAT I CANNOT DRIVE IT AT NIGHT. WHEN I HAVE TO DRIVE, I WILL EITHER FOLLOW A CAR IN FRONT OF ME CLOSELY AT NIGHT OR USE HIGH BEAMS. DEGRADATION STARTED TO GET WORSE BY 3 YEAR, I REPLACED WITH BETTER BULBS AND THEN WITH HIDS BUT STILL LIGHTING IS SO POOR THAT I ONLY USE THIS VEHICLE DURING DAY TIME.
THE TRUNK LATCH BECAME UNDONE AND LIFTED WHILE I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY HEADED HOME. ALL OF MY ITEMS FELL OUT AND I HAD TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO RELATCH.
ON FRIDAY 6/26/2020 WHILE DRIVING ON THE MA TURNPIKE I-90 W, SHORTLY BEFORE EXIT 20, THE HOOD OF MY 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA FLEW ALL THE WAY BACK CRASHING INTO THE WINDSHIELD AND FRONT PORTION OF THE ROOF. LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO SLOW DOWN AND PEEK UNDER THE BOTTOM PORTION OF THE HOOD TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY.     MY WINDSHIELD WAS CRACKED, BOTH SIDE FENDERS WERE BENT UP/ SLIGHTLY DISPLACED, THE ROOF WAS DENTED, INSIDE THE CAR THE CEILING SPEAKER/ SUNGLASS CONSOLE CAME CRASHING DOWN AND MY HOOD WAS DENTED AND HAVING TROUBLE STAYING SHUT.    I MANAGED TO SECURE IT DOWN AND DROVE SLOWLY TO EXIT 20. I IMMEDIATELY STOPPED AT AN AUTO SHOP NEAR BY AND THE OWNERS FIRST WORDS WERE, "LOOKING AT YOUR CAR, I CAN TELL YOU THIS IS EXACTLY HOW PEOPLE GET KILLED IN MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS".   I AM NOT SURPRISED. HAD I NOT BEEN ABLE TO SEE OR SAFELY SLOW DOWN, I MAY BE DEAD.     THE SHOP OWNER SHOWED HOW THE SPRAINED HINGES ALLOW THE HOOD TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK CAUSING WINDSHIELD DAMAGE MAINLY DUE TO THE SECONDARY HOOD LATCH NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. HE DID SPRAY SOME WD 40 ON THE LATCH TO GET IT TO FUNCTION A LITTLE BETTER; HE STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT SAFE AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND DRIVING IT.     THE DAMAGE WAS ESTIMATED AT $4000.
YOU CAN NOT USE REGULAR LIGHTS TO SEE WITH THIS CAR AT NIGHT. YOU MAY GET A GOOD FOOT OF LIGHTING IN FRONT OF THE CAR. VERY DANGEROUS. YOU COULD BE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AND BE SURPRISED BY A CURB OR GOING DOWN A STREET AT NIGHT WITH NO LIGHTING AROUND YOU AND HIT SOMETHING BC YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.   THE BRIGHTS WORK WONDERS BUT I CAN'T JUST GO AROUND BLINDING PEOPLE...  *TR
WHILE DRIVING IN TRAFFIC, THE CAR BEGAN JERKING BACK AND FORTH BEFORE COMPLETELY SHUTTING OFF. I WAS WITH MY SMALL CHILD IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION WHEN THIS HAPPENED. THIS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES WHENEVER I'D PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE OR DRIVE. I'M ONE OF HUNDREDS, IF NOT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THIS ISSUE, WHICH IS KNOWN TO SPECIFICALLY AFFECT 2013 MODELS. MY CHILD AND I NEARLY GOT IN AN ACCIDENT WHEN THIS HAPPENED.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING AT NIGHT, THE LOW BEAM HEADLAMPS WERE INADEQUATE FOR SAFE DRIVING. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE HI BEAM HEADLAMP WAS USED FOR NIGHTTIME DRIVING. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO PINE BELT NISSAN OF KEYPORT DEALER, (111 NJ-36, KEYPORT, NJ 07735) AND WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE HEADLIGHT REFLECTOR FAILED. THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED THAT THE HEADLAMP HOUSING NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE AND PROVIDED A CASE NUMBER. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 53,839.
THE VEHICLES LOW BEAM LIGHTS ARE DANGEROUSLY DEM AND HARD TO SEE WITH THEM ON. THEY HAVE GOTTEN WORSE OVER TIME AND PUTTING IN NEW EXPENSIVE HEADLIGHT HAVE NOT HELPED.   THE TRANSMISSION STILL SOMETIMES IN A HIGHER RMP. I HAVE TO TAP ON THE BRAKE TO GET IT UNSTUCK IN THAT RPM.
I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS VEHICLE, BUT ON NEW YEAR'S EVE WITH MY FAMILY IN THE CAR, MY 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA STALLED WHILE IDLING AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT. I DIDN'T DRIVE IT YESTERDAY (NEW YEARS DAY), AND BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALERSHIP FIRST THING THIS MORNING TO HAVE IT CHECKED OUT (JAN 2). I WAS TOLD THAT I NEED TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION! IT IS SHOCKING TO ME THAT A 6 Y.O. CAR -- WITHOUT ANY PROGRESSION OF SYMPTOMS OR ANY WARNING LIGHTS WHATSOEVER -- WOULD NEED AN ENTIRELY NEW TRANSMISSION. THESE SEEMS LIKE A MANUFACTURING PROBLEM TO ME, AS A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH REVEALED NUMEROUS NISSAN OWNERS COMPLAINING OF NEEDING TO REPLACE THEIR CVT PREMATURELY.
THE RIGHT REAR CONTROL ARM SNAPPED OFF DURING VEHICLE OPERATION IN MOTION RESULTING IN TOEING IN OF TIRE. BOTH JEFF SCHMITT NISSAN OF DAYTON AND NISSAN CORPORATE WERE UNCLEAR ON HOW TO RE-MEDIATE THE ISSUE AND WHAT WOULD BE COVERED FOR THE REPAIR, EVEN THOUGH A CAMPAIGN WAS POSTED ON NISSANASSIST.COM. NISSAN ALSO MENTIONED THAT IT WAS NOT A SAFETY CONCERN. GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE POSSIBLE COSTS TO BE INCURRED (UPWARDS OF $2,000 FOR ESTIMATE), I HAD TO PERSONALLY REPLACE THE CONTROL ARMS (LEFT WAS ABOUT TO SEPARATE AT ANY MOMENT), AND SWAY BAR LINKS.
MY CAR IS A 2013 WITH LESS THAN 40,000 MILES. IN THE MATTER OF 5 DAYS, THE TRANSMISSION HAS DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY. WHEN AT A STOPLIGHT, MY CAR WILL SHUT DOWN COMPLETELY. I HAVE TO PARK IT, TURN IT OFF, THEN CRANK IT BACK UP. WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A STOP, IT WILL STALL AS IF I HAVE IT IN NEUTRAL. EVEN WHILE DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE, MY RPM WILL BE FLUCTUATING, BUT MY ACCELERATION WOULDN'T CHANGE. IT WOULD STALL AT 40MPH, MAKE A JERKING MOTION, THEN PICK UP A LITTLE SPEED. TODAY IT BARELY WENT PAST 20MPH. NISSAN WILL NOT TAKE CARE OF THIS ISSUE, WHICH IS CLEARLY THEIR FAULT! NOW I HAVE TO GET A NEW TRANSMISSION PAID OUT OF MY OWN POCKET.
WHILE GETTING A NEW YORK STATE INSPECTION, I WAS INFORMED THAT BOTH MY REAR CONTROL ARMS WERE EITHER CRACKED OR WOULD BREAK SOON. THE MANAGER INFORMED ME OF THE POTENTIAL DANGER OF A CONTROL ARM FAILING WHILE DRIVING, SO WITHOUT HESITATION I HAD BOTH OF THEM REPAIRED IN ORDER TO PASS INSPECTION. THE MANAGER AT THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP HAD RECOMMENDED TO GET BOTH SIDES REPAIRED BECAUSE HE HAD SEEN DOZENS OF CARS OF THE SAME EXACT YEAR AND MODEL (2013 NISSAN ALTIMA SV SEDAN) WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. FROM MY RESEARCH, IT APPEARS THAT REGIONS THAT USE SALT TO CLEAR ROADS IN THE WINTER HAVE OR WILL ENCOUNTER A FAILING CONTROL ARM AND THAT A REFUND FOR THE REPAIRS IS POSSIBLE. I LIVE IN A TOWN NEAR UTICA, NY WHERE WE AVERAGE OVER 100 INCHES OF SNOW A YEAR, SO I WAS ALARMED WHEN I WAS REJECTED FOR A REIMBURSEMENT FROM NISSAN WHEN CONTACTING THEM. IF NISSAN HAS A SERVICE CAMPAIGN, THEY ARE NOT DOING IT FAST ENOUGH WHICH ENDANGERS THE LIVES OF PEOPLE EVERY MILE THEY DRIVE IN A 2013 ALTIMA. I URGE YOU TO PLEASE MAKE THIS PROBLEM ONE OF YOUR PRIORITIES BEFORE MORE CARS CONTINUE TO FAIL. MY CONTROL ARMS JUST RECENTLY FAILED, BUT IT COULD BE BECAUSE OUR REGION USES SALT ON THE ROADWAYS FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS A YEAR. OTHER REGIONS THAT USE LESS SALT WILL MOST LIKELY TAKE LONGER TO FAIL; SO EVERY YEAR, THERE SHOULD BE MORE AND MORE CARS TO REPORT THIS ISSUE. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO CATCH THE PROBLEM BECAUSE OF THE INSPECTION, SO PLEASE HELP TO REPORT THIS KNOWN SAFETY ISSUE TO PREVENT ANY CASUALTIES.     P.S- THE PHOTO PROVIDED BELOW IS OF A 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA THAT WAS NEXT TO MINE. I ASKED THE MECHANIC IF I COULD TAKE A PICTURE OF WHAT THE ISSUE LOOKED LIKE SINCE MY PROBLEM WAS REPAIRED AT THAT MOMENT.
THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS ARE DANGEROUSLY DIM CREATING HAZARDOUS DRIVING CONDITIONS WHEN OPERATING THE VEHICLE AFTER DARK. THIS APPEARS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE ALTIMA RELATED TO THE DETERIORATION OF THE REFLECTOR BOWL IN THE LAMP ASSEMBLY. AS A SAFETY CONCERN I AM REQUESTING NHTSA TO ORDER NISSAN TO RECALL THE AFFECTED VEHICLE'S FOR REPAIR.
RANDOMLY MY AIRBAG LIGHT CAME ON. BUT NO AIRBAGS EVER DEPLOYED. ALSO I BELIVEVE MY YEARS TRANSMISSION HAS A RECALL ON IT. EVERY NOW AND AGAIN IT DOWNSHIFTS WHILE I AM ACCELERATING ON THE HIGHWAY AND IT TERRIFIES ME. I WOULD APPRECIATE FEELING SAFE IN MY INVESTMENT
AT 68830 MILES THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT ON THIS CAR. TERRIBLE.
MY 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA HEADLIGHTS ARE VERY DIM AND I HAVE TO DRIVE WITH BRIGHTS ON JUST TO SEE AT NIGHT. THIS IS A REAL SAFETY CONCERN. I HAVE REPLACED THE BULBS THREE TIMES WITH LED, HID AND BACK TO HALOGEN AND THEY HAVE NOT FIXED THE PROBLEM. THEY CONTINUE TO GET DIMMER AND DIMMER.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE DID NOT ACCELERATE WITHOUT WARNING. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO TORRE NISSAN (760-777-8999, LOCATED AT 79125 HIGHWAY 111, LA QUINTA, CA 92253) WHERE NOTHING WAS DONE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHO DIAGNOSED THAT THE TRANSMISSION NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE CONTACT INQUIRED ABOUT TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN NUMBER: 16-102 AND WAS INFORMED TO CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE AND STATED THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL. THE CONTACT WAS REFERRED TO NHTSA. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 104,000.
~2013 ALTIMA W/ 83K MILES. WE'LL MAINTAINED VIA DEALER ONLY.~  TRAVELING IN A  STRAIGHT DIRECTION @ 30MPH THROUGH A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD WITH CHILDREN IN BACK SEAT.   VEHICLE LOST REAR CONTROL AND BEGAN SWERVING/FISHTAILING.   I WAS BARELY ABLE TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR FEAR OF THE WHEEL COLLAPSING IN ON ITSELF.   VISUAL INSPECTION SHOWED RIGHT REAR CONTROL ARM SNAPPED COMPLETE THROUGH. WHEEL WAS PITCHED INWARD ABOUT 20 RESTING ONLY ON THE SPRING.
HEADLIGHT LOW BEAM IS GETTING DIMMER.  REPLACED BULBS AND CHECKED GROUNDING STILL DIM.  PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE A DEFECT IN THE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY.  UNSAFE TO DRIVE AT NIGHT.  HIGH BEAMS WORK WELL.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA. WHILE THE CONTACT'S HUSBAND WAS DRIVING VARIOUS SPEEDS, THE STEERING WHEEL BECAME UNCONTROLLABLE. IN ADDITION, THE REAR PASSENGER WHEEL FRACTURED. THERE WERE NO WARNING INDICATORS ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHO STATED THAT THE REAR LOWER CONTROL ARM NEEDED TO BE REPAIRED. THE LOCAL DEALER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS CONTACTED AND PROVIDED CASE NUMBER: 36454186. NO FURTHER ASSISTANCE WAS PROVIDED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 140,000.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA. WHILE DRIVING 35 MPH, THE LOWER CONTROL ARM FRACTURED. THE VEHICLE VEERED TO THE RIGHT AND THE CONTACT LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE BODY OF THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT COMPLY WITH ANY TURN AND THE FRAME STAYED TO THE RIGHT. THE VEHICLE WAS DRIVEN TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHO DIAGNOSED THAT A NEW LOWER CONTROL ARM WAS NEEDED AND SCHEDULED TO BE INSTALLED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE BY THE MECHANIC. THE MANUFACTURER STATED THAT THEY MAY ISSUE A RECALL FOR THE FAILURE IN THE FUTURE. THE DEALER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 126,000.
47,000 MILES HEADLIGHTS BARELY VISIBLE ON LOW BEAM
THE HEADLAMPS ARE EXTREMELY DIM ON MY 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA. I HAVE TO DRIVE WITH HIGHBEAMS ON TO DRIVE AT NIGHT. I'VE BEEN STOPPED BY THE POLICE FOR HAVING DIM HEADLIGHTS. I'VE CHANGED THE BULBS AND THEY ARE STILL DIM. I'VE BEEN TOLD THE HEADLIGHT HOUSING IS DEFECTIVE AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACE AT THE COST OF OVER $800. THIS IS A MANUFACTURES DEFECT AND NISSAN IS SILENT ON THIS ISSUE. IT'S KNOWN THAT 2013, 2015, 2016 ALTIMAS HAVE THIS SAME ISSUE. THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE A RECALL. PLEASE HELP, I DRIVE WITH CHILDREN IN THE CAR AND I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE AT NIGHT. I DIVE IN THE CITY, AT NIGHT AND IN THE COUNTRY, THE LOW BEAMS ARE LOW AND I'M FORCED TO USE THE HIGH BEAMS WHICH IS NOT SAFE FOR ON COMING TRAFFIC. NISSAN SHOULD ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.
THE GEAR SHIFTER STUCK IN PARK  THIS IS MY 2ND SHIFTER WITHIN  2 YEARS, BEEN REPLACED BEFORE NOW IT MESSING UP AGAIN. I NEED HELP WITH THIS.
VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION ON A STRAIGHT FLAT STRETCH OF COUNTY ROAD TRAVELING AT APPROXIMATELY 40 MPH.  VEHICLE STARTED TO "SHIMMY" AND STEERING WHEEL RESPONSE BECAME SLUGGISH/ERRATIC, AND SKID CONTROL INDICATOR LIGHT CAME ON. VEHICLE WAS SLOWED TO APPROXIMATELY 20 MPH AND TURNED INTO A GAS STATION LOT AND PARKED.  VEHICLE WAS TURNED OFF THEN RESTARTED IN CASE SKID LAMP COULD RESET.  VEHICLE WAS SLOWLY BACKED ABOUT A FOOT WHEN A LOUD "CLUNK" WAS HEARD.  VEHICLE WAS STOPPED AND REAR TIRE ON DRIVER SIDE INSPECTED.  AT FIRST, TIRE APPEARED TO BE COMING OFF ROTOR UNTIL CLOSER INSPECTION SHOWED THAT THE DRIVER'S SIDE REAR CONTROL ARM SNAPPED AT THE WELD NEAR TO WHERE IT CONNECTS TO THE FRAME.  FLATBED TOW TRUCK WAS CALLED AND VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE CAR IS AWAITING REPAIR.  TOW TRUCK OPERATOR INDICATED THAT HE HAS SEEN THIS PROBLEM MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE ON SAME MODEL CAR.  RESEARCH ON INTERNET POST INCIDENT INDICATES SIMILAR MAKE/MODEL YEAR CARS HAVING SAME ISSUE.
MY CALL STALLED WHEN I WAS STATIONARY, IN DRIVE, AT AN INTERSECTION. SINCE THEN WHENEVER I SHIFT INTO EITHER DRIVE OR REVERSE THE CAR STALLS AND SHUTS OFF. THE CHECK ENGINE, CHECK BATTERY, AND GENERAL WARNING LIGHT ALL COME ON WHEN I EXPERIENCE THIS PROBLEM. I HAVE SEEN OTHER PEOPLE ON VARIOUS ONLINE FORUMS REPORT THIS ISSUE. MY NISSAN ALTIMA 2013 HAS A LITTLE OVER 80,000 MILES ON IT. I AM THE ONLY OWNER OF THIS CAR.
MY LIGHTS REAL DIM AT NIGHT SO I REPLACE THEM WITH NEW LED LIGHTS AND THEY STILL LOOKS DIM I CAN'T SEE NOTHING THIS IS REAL SAFETY ISSUE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GOT KIDS
THE AIRBAG LIGHT FOR THE PASSENGER SIDE REMAINS OFF REGARDLESS OF THE WEIGHT OF THE PASSENGER IN THE SEAT, THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING ISSUE FOR 3 YEARS..  MULTIPLE TRIPS TO THE DEALER (AT AT $155.00 PER DIAGONSTIC) WITHOUT A RESOLUTION. THE PRIOR THE DEALER STATED WAS DUE TO A LOW BATTERY.  A NEW BATTERY WAS INSTALLED WITH THE SAME RESULTS.  RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET SHOWS MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS WITH THIS ISSUE.  THE CAR WILL NOT PASS VIRGINIA INSPECTION AND SHOULD BE DEEMED UNSAFE UNTIL THERE IS A RESOLUTION.
TURNED INTO THE STREET LEADING TO MY HOME,STARTED TO ACCELERATE, HEARD A LOUD NOISE AND THE VEHICLE SWERVED INTO THE OPPOSITE LANE. THIS IS A NARROW ROAD, AND LUCKILY THERE WAS NO ONCOMING TRAFFIC,OR THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENT.LIMPED THE VEHICLE HOME AND SAW IT WAS DROOPING DOWN ON THE DRIVERS SIDE AND THE REAR WHEEL WAS OUT OF POSITION. TOWED TO DEALER AND WAS DIAGNOSED  AS BROKEN LOWER LINK OR CONTROL ARM. MY BILL WAS 1600.00 TO REPLACE RIGHT AND LEFT ARMS AND PARTS. THIS IS NOT RIGHT,AS IT IS ONLY 6 YEARS OLD WITH 48K MILES.THIS IS DEFINETLY A DEFECT AND THIS VEHICLE SHOULD BE RECALLED BEFORE SOMEONE IS HURT OR WORSE. THANK YOU
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA. WHILE DRIVING 45 MPH, THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO SWERVE. THE CONTACT NOTICED THAT THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE LOWER CONTROL ARM WAS DETACHED DUE TO CORROSION. THE VEHICLE WAS STILL ABLE TO BE DRIVEN. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE DEALER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 110,000. *BF  CONSUMER STATED TRANSMISSION ALSO FAILED AT 90,000, LOWER CONTROL ARM RUSTED AND BROKE, ALMOST CAUSING CONSUMER'S DAUGHTER TO WRECK. TOTAL CONTROL ARM FAILURE.*JB
I WAS DRIVING UNDER 25 MPH (IN A STRAIGHT LINE) ON A SMOOTH RODE WHEN THE DRIVER SIDE OF MY CAR FELT LIKE IT LOCKED UP FOR A SECOND. MY STEERING WHEEL IMMEDIATELY LOST ALIGNMENT AND THE WHEEL NEEDED TO BE KEPT AT 2:30 TO DRIVE STRAIGHT. I MADE IT LESS THAN A MILE AFTER THE INITIAL INCIDENT (I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST WHEEL OUT OF ALIGNMENT) BUT WITH EACH RODE BUMP I HIT, MY BACK END GOT LOOSER AND LOOSER. I FINALLY PULLED OFF AND PACKED MY CAR. WHEN I WENT TO MOVE IT, IN REVERSE, THE WAS A LARGE NOISE AND I COULD TELL SOMETHING WAS FRACTURED IN THE SUSPENSION. THE DRIVER SIDE REAR WHEEL WAS CRASHED INTO THE WHEEL WHEEL AND THE CONTROL ARM WAS BROKEN.    THIS APPEARS TO BE THE SAME THING NHTSA ACTION NUMBER PE18013 IS IN REGARD TO, AND I LIVE IN CLEVELAND, OH, WITH MORE THAN 100,000 MILES OF MY CAR'S 130,000 MILES PUT ON IN NORTHERN OHIO.
THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS ARE SO DIM IT'S HARD TO SEE THE ROAD AT NIGHT.
DIM LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS. OVER THE PAST 1.5 + YEARS THE HEADLIGHTS HAVE BEEN PROGRESSIVELY BEEN GETTING DIMMER. IT IS TO THE POINT THAT DRIVING IS DANGEROUS AS IT IS DIFFICULTY TO SEE THE ROADWAY AND ONCOMING AREAS. I HAD THIS CHECKED AT DEALERSHIP AND WAS ADVISED THAT THE LENSES ARE DEGRADING. WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL OR FIX BY NISSAN. CHANGING BULBS WOULD NOT HELP. THEY QUOTED AN APPROXIMATE REPLACEMENT OF $1000.00 TO $1200.00 WITH ALL NEW HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY. THIS WAS THE ONLY FIX AVAILABLE AS THE LENSES CANNOT BE REPLACED. THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY HAS TO BE REPLACED.
THE LEFT REAR LOWER CONTROL ARM RUSTED OFF AT ONE OF THE WELDS NEAR THE BUSHING. THE PART BROKE WHILE BACKING UP IN A PARKING LOT. THE CAR WAS THE DRIVEN ON THE STREET NOT KNOWING WHAT WAS WRONG.
LEFT WORK GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE. NOTICED THE STEERING WAS SLOPPY WITH LESS CONTROL. I WENT THROUGH A PATCHED AREA IN THE ROAD AND THE WHOLE CAR SHOOK AND THERE WAS A NOISE IN THE PASSENGER REAR. I CALLED MY HUSBAND AND HE MET ME IN THE GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT SO HE COULD DRIVE THE CAR HOME. HE DROVE ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE AND CALLED ME TO PULL INTO A PARKING LOT. HE GOT UNDER THE CAR AND SAW THAT THE LOWER CONTROL ARM HAD RUSTED AND BROKEN AWAY FROM THE FRAME. HE ALSO NOTICED THE PASSENGER REAR WHEEL AT A STRANGE ANGLE WITH THE TOP LEANING INTO THE WHEEL WELL. WE TOOK THE CAR 2 BLOCKS TO THE SHOP. THE SHOP HAD TO GET THE PARTS FROM NISSAN AND WHEN THEY ORDERED THEM THEY WERE TOLD THE PART HAD BEEN REDESIGNED SO BOTH SIDES HAD TO BE REPLACED. THEY REPLACED BOTH REAR LOWER CONTROL ARMS, BOTH REAR SHOCKS AND OTHER SUSPENSION PARTS. I AM JUST LUCKY THE TIRE DIDN'T FALL OFF WHILE I WAS DRIVING.
MY VEHICLE HAS 65K MILES AND HAS BEGAN TO HAVE STICKING GEARS. THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT AFTER STARTING THE CAR THE GEAR WILL NOT MOVE WHEN PRESSING THE BREAKS AND LOCK RELEASE BUTTON. THE PROBLEM OCCURS 7/10 TIMES. THIS IS A WIDE SPREAD PROBLEM AFTER 50K MILES BUT NISSAN REFUSES TO RECALL THE 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA MODELS. THE GEAR ALSO GETS STUCK IN DRIVE WHEN TO WHERE I CAN'T MOVE IT TO OTHER GEARS WHEN THE CAR IS IN DRIVE. THIS RECENTLY HAPPENED WHILE AT THE CAR WAS AND I WAS TRYING TO SWITCH TO NEUTRAL.
2013 NISSAN ALTIMA MOONROOF EXPLODED WHILE DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE AT APPROXIMATELY 75MPH. THERE WAS A LOUD POP AND AIR WAS HEARD ON ROOF. SAW FLYING DEBRIS FROM REARVIEW MIRROR WHILE TRYING TO PULL OVER TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED. PULLED OVER AND REALIZED LARGE CHUNKS OF THE TEMPERED GLASS WAS GONE. THERE WERE MINOR SCRATCHES ON THE TRUNK PAINT FROM THE DEBRIS HITTING IT AS IT FLEW OFF. THERE WAS VERY LITTLE TRAFFIC AROUND AND NO OVERPASSES. TEMPERATURES WEREN'T EXTREME AS IT WAS A MILDLY WARM FALL DAY (MID 60'S) AND ROADS WERE DRY. THE GLASS IS STICKING OUT ABOVE THE ROOF WHICH INDICATES THAT IT WAS AN EXPLOSION RATHER THAN SOMETHING CRASHING DOWN ON THE MOONROOF.
CVT TRANSMISSION WENT ON MY ALTIMA. MY WARRANTY RAN OUT IN FEBRUARY OF 2018, THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT IN MAY OF 2018. THE COMPANY PAID FOR HALF $2200 AND I HAD TO PAY THE OTHER HALF. I FEEL WITH ALL THE ISSUES NISSAN IS EXPERIENCING WITH THEIR CVT I SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO PAY ANYTHING.
07/09/2013 TOOK CAR IN FOR A CVT REPROGRAM, I NOTICED THE CHANGES IN SHIFTING BUT THOUGHT IT WAS DUE TO THE SOFTWARE REPROGRAM,ON 08/23/2018 WHILE DRIVING THE CAR ENGINE SHUTS OFF, MANAGE TO START IT UP AND DROVE HOME, LATER ON THAT EVENING I TRIED TO START THE CAR AND WHEN I SHIFT TO REVERSE OR DRIVE THE CAR WILL CUT OFF, 08/30/2018 TOWED MY CAR TO THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP, THEY RAN A DIAGNOSTIC AND I NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION, NISSAN NEEDS TO TAKE CARE OF THIS CVT I JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR A TRANSMISSION.
THE PROBLEM WITH THE  2013 NISSAN ALIMA CVT 2.5 MODEL. THE CAR STOPS WHEN IDELING WHICH CREATES A DANGEROUS SITUATION ON THE ROAD. THE RPM WILL FLUCTUATE WITHOUT WARNING AND GEARS SLIPPING AT ROAD SPEEDS. SIMILAR CASES HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED IN VARIOUS FORUM AND NISSAN IS NOT WILLING TO TAKE THIS AS THERE RESPONSIBILTY OF CREATING AN INFERIOR QUALITY PRODUCT. IT IS TIME NISSAN OWNS UP TO IT
I HAVE BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS WITH MY DRIVER SIDE AIRBAG LIGHT COMING ON AND STAYS RED NO BLINKING SINCE I PURCHASED MY NISSAN ALTIMA 2013 IN NOVEMBER 2012. I HAVE HAD IT SERVICED FOR THIS PROBLEM AT LEAST 3 TO 5 TIMES AT NISSAN DEALSHIPS. THEY REPROGRAMED SYSTEM AND RAN THE CODES. LAST YEAR 2017 IN JULY THE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN AND TAKEN STERLING MCCALL NISSAN HOUSTON, TX AND THEY SAID CODE READ SENSOR AND THE DRIVER BACK SEAT MODULE NEED TO REPLACE WHOLE UNIT AND NOT COVERED AND SO I GOT INTO MY CAR THE LIGHT WAS OFF AND NEVER CAME BACK ON UNTIL NOW ON JUN 23 2018 WHEN I STARTED MY CAR UP IN MY GARAGE. NO ONE HAS GIVEN ME A CONCRETE ANSWER IF THERE IS DEFAULT ON MY AIRBAG LIGHT GOING ON SOMETIMES AND THEN STAYS OFF. I HAVE SPOKEN WITH NISSAN MFG  MORE THEN ONE TIME AND OPEN UP A CASE AND THEY NOT WANTING TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM THEY JUST TELL ME TO GO TO DEALERSHIP AND CLOSE MY CASE. I BELIEVE I HAVE BAD AIRBAG OR SENOR CONTROL UINT. IF YOU WOULD LIKE LOOK INTO MY MECHANICAL HISTORY OF MY CAR.
INTERIOR DOOR HANDLE(S) BREAK BECAUSE ONLY PLASTIC IS USED TO SECURE A METAL BALL ATTACHED TO THE CABLE TO OPEN THE DOOR. AT AROUND 40 TO 60,000 MILES THE INTERIOR HANDLE BREAKS, ALMOST CONSISTENTLY BASED ON ONLINE RESEARCH. THIS KNOWN PROBLEM SHOULD BE REPAIRED BY MAKING THE AREA WHERE THE CABLE ATTACHES MORE STURDY, OR USE A MORE STURDY MATERIAL SUCH AS METAL. IF THIS HANDLE WERE TO BREAK WHILE TRYING TO EXIT THE VEHICLE DUE TO AN EMERGENCY, THE RESULTS COULD BE CATASTROPHIC.
NISSAN KNOWINGLY PUTS DRIVERS & PASSENGERS AT SERIOUS RISK OF INJURY AND DEATH SINCE NISSAN REFUSES TO RECALL AND REPLACE DEFECTIVE NISSAN HEADLIGHTS. NISSAN IS FULLY AWARE THAT NISSAN HEADLIGHTS ARE DEFECTIVE, AND THAT DRIVERS ARE UNABLE TO DRIVE SAFELY AT NIGHT DUE TO DEFECTIVE NISSAN HEADLIGHTS. DEFECTIVE NISSAN HEADLIGHTS ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS DRIVING WITH NO HEADLIGHTS AT ALL! *JS
FOR MORE THAN SECERAL MONTHS MY LIGHTING ON MY CAR HAS BEEN VERY DIM. ALMOST TO THE POINT OF I AM NOT FOR SURE IF MY LIGHTS ARE ON AT NIGHT OR NOT (BUT THEY STAY ON AUTOMATIC).
1. BREAK SWITCH NEEDED REPLACING AND NOW THE ISSUE IS HAPPENING AGAIN AS FAR OCCASIONALLY LOSES POWER CAUSING SOME POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUES IN PULLING OUT INTO TRAFFIC.  2.  BOTH PASSENGER AND DRIVER INTERIOR DOOR HANDLES DO NOT OPEN DOOR WHICH IS A MAJOR ISSUE AS THE ONLY WAY TO OPEN DOORS IS TO ROLL WINDOW DOWN.  IN AN EMERGENCY THIS COULD CAUSE SERIOUS THREAT TO SAFETY IF WINDOWS CAN NOT BE ROLLED DOWN.
I AM REPORTING A DANGEROUS CONDITION WITH THE 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA TRANSMISSION.  THE TRANSMISSION FAILED ON MY CAR AT 75,000 MILES WHILE DRIVING 65 - 70 MPH ON THE FLORIDA TURNPIKE. THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY BASED ON MILES (NOT TIME) AND I WAS DENIED COVERAGE BY NISSAN DUE TO WARRANTY EXPIRATION AND BECAUSE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED USED. THE TRANSMISSION HAS STUTTERED SINCE PURCHASE BUT IT SEEMED TO BE A QUIRK OF THE CAR; HOWEVER, ON DEC. 5, 2017, IT BRIEFLY WOULD NOT MOVE IN REVERSE AS MY DAUGHTER (THE PRIMARY DRIVER) BEGAN A 4-HOUR DRIVE FROM ORLANDO TO MIAMI. IT ENGAGED AND SHE CONTINUED ON HER TRIP. WHILE DRIVING ON THE FLORIDA TURNPIKE, THE TRANSMISSION DISENGAGED WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEED. SHE WAS ABLE TO COAST THROUGH TRAFFIC TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. SHE TURNED OFF THE CAR AND IT STARTED AND MOVED AGAIN.  IT WAS NIGHTTIME AND NOT SAFE FOR HER TO REMAIN ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. THE TRANSMISSION CONTINUED TO STOP SEVERAL TIMES DURING HER DRIVE AND SHE AGAIN PULLED OVER, STOPPED, THEN RESTARTED THE CAR.  SHE MADE IT SAFELY TO MIAMI. THE NEXT MORNING, DEC. 6, THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE IN DRIVE OR REVERSE. ON DEC 10 THE CAR WAS TOWED BY AAA TO A NEARBY AUTO MECHANIC. ON DEC. 11 THE TRANSMISSION FAILURE WAS DIAGNOSED AND I WAS ADVISED TO TAKE THE CAR TO A NISSAN DEALER BECAUSE OF THE NUMEROUS REPORTED PROBLEMS WITH THE CVT TRANSMISSIONS, INCLUDING AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON MODELS UP TO YEAR 2010.  ON DEC. 11 IT WAS TOWED TO NISSAN AND WE ESTABLISHED A CASE WITH NISSAN CUSTOMER CARE.  TODAY, DEC. 19 WE WERE INFORMED THAT NISSAN WILL NOT COVER ANY OF THE COST OF REPAIR.  THE REPAIR ESTIMATE IS AT LEAST $3,700. THEY WILL REPLACE WITH THE SAME TRANSMISSION, SO WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY IN THE FUTURE.  WE STILL OWE ~$8,000 ON THE VEHICLE AND FEEL WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE REPAIR.
THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS ARE EXTREMELY DIM. I HAVE AND THE BULBS CHANGED TWICE. AFTER CHANGING THEM IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE IN THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE LOW BEAM. I HAVE TALKED TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT NISSAN WHERE OUR CAR IS SERVICED AND HE HAS STATED THAT THEY HAVE ALSO HAD SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ABOUT PEOPLE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH LOW BEAM. AFTER GETTING ONLINE AND CHECKING OUT TO SEE WHAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID IT APPEARS THE LIGHT ASSEMBLY HAS TO BE REPLACED WHICH RUN SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 700 TO $1,000 AT THE DEALERSHIP. THE CAR IS ACTUALLY UNSAFE TO DRIVE AT NIGHT UNLESS I USE MY HIGH BEAMS AND THIS HAS BEEN CAUSING A PROBLEM TO THE OTHER CARS THAT ARE ON THE ROAD. IT'S WAY TOO DANGEROUS TO DRIVE IT IN THIS CONDITION SO I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT HAVING TO PURCHASE AFTERMARKET REPLACEMENT ASSEMBLIES BECAUSE THEIR COST IS MUCH LESS THAN THE DEALERSHIPS. I'M ASSURED THAT NISSAN IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM BUT DOES NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING TO CORRECT IT.
THE AIR BAG LIGHT STAYS ON IN THE DASH WHEN DRIVING AND WHEN SOMEONE SITS IN THE PASSENGER SEAT THE AIR BAG STAYS OFF SO IF I GET INTO AN ACCIDENT NONE OF THE AIR BAGS WILL DEPLOY. THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME I TURN MY VEHICLE ON.
MY 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA, WHICH WAS PURCHASED NEW HAS HAD ISSUES WITH THE CVT TRANSMISSION SINCE IT WAS PURCHASED.  IN 9/2014 AT 42K MILES THE TRANSMISSION FAILED AND WAS REPLACED.  NOW IN 9/2017 I AM BEING TOLD BY NISSAN THAT THE TRANSMISSION THAT WAS REPLACED BY THEM IN 2014 IS ALSO BAD AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AT A COST TO ME OF $4,100.00.  WHO CAN AFFORD A $4,100 REPAIR ON A VEHICLE THAT IS STILL BEING PAID FOR MONTHLY, AND WHY IS IT THE CONSUMER'S FAULT THAT NISSAN NA IS MAKING AND SELLING FAULTY, UNSAFE PRODUCTS?  NISSAN NA KNOWS OF THE ONGOING ISSUES WITH THESE CVT TRANSMISSIONS, BUT CHOSES TO NOTHING TO RECTIFY THE ISSUES.  MY VEHICLE WILL NOT PULL AND MAKES A WHINING NOISE WHILE I AM DRIVING.  THIS IT THE SAME ISSUE THAT OCCURRED IN 2014.  WHILE I WAS IN MOTION ON A MAJOR INTERSTATE THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO LOSE POWER, SPUDDER AND JERK, AND DROPPED DOWN TO ABOUT 10-15 MPH.  IT WAS A HORRIFYING EXPERIENCE TO BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSTATE TRAVELING AT 60 MPH, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN START TO LOSE SPEED.  I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE TO THE SHOULDER SAFELY.  THESE VEHICLES ARE UNSAFE TO BE DRIVEN.  I AM IN TOTAL DISBELIEF THAT NONE OF THE AGENCIES CHARGED WITH THE PROTECTION OF CONSUMERS SAFETY AND ETHICAL TREATMENT , WILL OR HAS GOTTEN INVOLVED TO FORCE NISSAN TO STOP ENDANGERING THE WELL BEING OF THOSE OF US WHO DRIVE THESE VEHICLES.  I AM A LOYAL NISSAN OWNER, WHO HAS OWNED 2 OTHER NISSAN VEHICLES.  IN FACT, I CURRENTLY OWN A 1995 NISSAN MAXIMA THAT HAS NEVER HAD A TRANSMISSION ISSUE.  HOW CAN A 22 YEAR OLD CAR STILL DRIVE PERFECTLY AND A 2013 NEED 2 TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENTS.  SOMEONE NEEDS TO HOLD NISSAN ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND TREATMENT OF CONSUMERS, AS WELL AS THEIR BLATANT DISREGARD FOR THE SAFETY OF THOSE OF US WHO DRIVE AND TRANSPORT PASSENGERS IN THEIR VEHICLES EVERYDAY.
I TRIED TO START MY CAR AND THE ONBOARD COMPUTER SCREEN SAY NO KEY DETECTED, I HAVE THE KEY IN MY HAND AND STILL IT WILL NOT START, I CAN UNLOCK THE DOORS, TRUNK ETC. FINE, I EVEN WENT AND BOUGHT THE SAME EXACT NEW BATTERY FOR THE KEY FOG AND THE PROBLEM PERSIST, I WENT ONLINE AND LOOK UP NISSAN OWNERS WITH SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH NISSAN ALTIMA KEY FOG PROBLEM AND IT SEEM LIKE A COMMON ISSUE, BUT SURPRISE THAT THERE IS NO RECALL ON THE ISSUE, EVERYBODY I KNOW THAT OWNS A NISSAN TOLD ME THERE IS TIME THEY BE DRIVING AND  THE ONBOARD COMPUTER STATE NO KEY DETECTED, THANK GOD I DON'T LIVE I A REMOTE LOCATION OR ELSE I WOULD BE STRANDED, ONLINE EVERYONE THAT HAD THE PROBLEM HAD TO END UP PAYING $500 OR MORE TO FIX THE ISSUE, WHICH I FEEL IS A DEFECT IN NISSAN ENGINE CONTROL UNIT SYSTEM, I CONTACT THE DEALERSHIP THAT I BOUGHT MY NISSAN ALTIMA FROM AND THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME OVER #500 TOTAL TO FIX THE ISSUE, I THINK IT IS A SCAM, I FOUND A WORK AROUND THE ISSUE BUT IT IS JUST NOT RIGHT THAT THEY KNOW THE ENGINE CONTROL UNIT HAS A PROBLEM AND THE REFUSE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE, EXCEPT LEAVE THE CUSTOMER WITH A NEW BILL OR STRANDED
LEAVING WORK FROM PARKING GARAGE ON MAY 30,2017, PUT CAR IN GEAR FOR REVERSE AND CAR DID NOT MOVE, FORWARD AND BACKWARDS,HAD TO GET HELP TO PUSH CAR IN PARKING SPACE AND GET A RECKER TO PULL THE CAR HOME, CARS GEARS ARE NOT WORKING, AND THIS IS A 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA.
AFTER STARTUP WITH A PASSENGER IN THE FRONT SEAT, THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG LIGHT STAYS ON INTERMITTANTLY.  WE HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR 5 TIMES.  4 TIMES THEY "REPROGRAMMED THE PCM ACCORDING TO THE RECALL" AND THE LAST TIME DID NOTHING.  I DID CALL NISSAN AND THEY OPENED A 'CASE' PRIOR TO THE LAST REPAIR ATTEMPT (#25798531) AND STILL NO ATTEMPT AT REPAIR WAS DONE BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM (IN 30 MILES, DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES THEY ACTUALLY GOT OUT OF THE PASSENGER SEAT AND RESTARTED THE CAR).  THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING ALMOST SINCE NEW; BUT WE THOUGHT THE LIGHT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ON!  I KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT AN UNCOMMON PROBLEM VIA RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET.
I WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH SHUDDERING AND VIBRATION THE CAR HAD A RECALL WITH CVT TRANSMISSION SOFTWARE   AFTER I GOT THE CAR BACK THE VIBRATION MADE IT WORSE AND BLUETTOTH BARELY WORKS
THEY FIX MY PASSAGER AIRBAG BUT MY DRIVER SIDE CAME ON. AND MY CAR ENGINE SOUND LOUD WENT U DRIVE IT. SOUND LIKE A MUFFLER SOUND BUT  I DON'T HAVE A HOLD ON IT.
VEHICLE WAS MOVING ON A CITY STREET WHEN IT WAS HIT ON THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR BY ANOTHER VEHICLE.  SIDE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY AFTER RECENT RECALL WORK REGARDING SRS WAS PERFORMED.  PLEASE SEE ATTACHED DOCUMENTATION.  *TR
BRAKES MAKE SQUEAKY NOISE ALL THE TIME. PASSANGER AIRBAG SIGN DOES NOT SHOW EVEN IF SOMEONE IS SITTING
SHIFT GEAR LOCKS UP IN PARK AND WILL NOT MOVE UNLESS YOU PRESS THE SHIFT OVER RIDE. ONLY 39000 MILES ON THE CAR. VEHICLE IS STATIONARY WHEN THIS HAPPENS.0
"TAKATA RECALL" I WENT TO PUT CAR IN REVERSE AND CAR JUST SHUT OFF. STARTED RIGHT BACK UP BUT SHUT OFF AGAIN WHEN PUT INTO DRIVE. EVENTUALLY I GOT CAR TO GO WITHOUT SHUTTING OFF BUT FELT CAR JERKING ON AND OFF AND ALMOST SHUTTING OFF WHEN I CAME TO COMPLETE STOP. WOULD HAVE TO QUICKLY PUSH ON GAS TO KEEP CAR FROM TURNING OFF. CONTINUES TO JERK WHILE DRIVING BUT NOT CONTINUOUSLY.
WHILE I WAS DRIVING IT JUST STOP AND FORCING TO START WHEN HAVE IT CHECK THEY SAY SAID ITS GAS PUMP WITH OTHER SEVERAL PROBLEM , I RECENTLY BOUGHT THE CAR  NOT EVEN AFTER  THREE MONTHS IT START GAVE THOSE PROBLEM , NOW IT HAVE BEEN SITTING FOR ALMOST A YEAR NOW WITHOUT DRIVING , I STILL MAKES MY PAYMENT EVERY MONTH , I CAN'T HAVE YOU GUYS A EXACT DATE WHEN IT REALLY HAPPENED BUT I REALLY NEED A INVESTIGATION FOR THE CAR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE MY CELL NUMBER [XXX]. THANK YOU    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR
I PURCHASED THIS CAR 1 YEAR AGO, AND IN THE PAST 2 DAYS (AT 86K MILES), IT HAS DIED AT A STOP A TOTAL OF 4 TIMES WHILE ON THE ROAD WHEN I CAME TO A STOP (3 TIMES IN 1/4 MILE, UPHILL - COULD NOT GET IT BACK INTO DRIVE, HAD 6 PEOPLE PUSH IT TO THE SIDE PARKING LOT). I WAS NOT ABLE TO GET IT STARTED TILL THE 6TH TRY IN THE PARKING LOT (HAD TO SWITCH TO NEUTRAL AND THEN TO DRIVE IN ORDER FOR IT TO NOT SHUT OFF).  THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE MOST TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD DRIVING. I GOT THIS CAR BECAUSE IT HAD HIGH SAFETY RATINGS, WHAT A JOKE - WORST INVESTMENT OF MY LIFE!! I AM NOW $12K IN DEBT WITH A CAR THAT CAN'T EVEN GET ME FROM POINT A TO POINT B WITHOUT BREAKING DOWN.
A/C DOES NOT COOLING, JUST HOT AIR.
I WAS STOPPED AT AN INTERSECTION WHEN THE VEHICLE STARTED JERKING AND MOVING FORWARD.  I THOUGHT I GOT REAR ENDED BY THE CAR BEHIND ME, SO I TURNED THE IGNITION OFF.  IT TURNS OUT THE CVT WAS HAVING ISSUES.  I TURNED THE CAR BACK ON AND STARTED DRIVING.THE CAR WOULD FEEL LIKE IT WAS DOWNSHIFTING WHILE DRIVING, ALMOST CAUSING ACCIDENTS WITH THE VEHICLES BEHIND ME.  I BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE DEALER WHERE THEY SAID THE CVT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.
THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT ACCELERATE AFTER GETTING ON THE HIGHWAY COMING FROM THE MAIN STREET. CAR HAD TO BE TOWED BECAUSE THE VEHICLE COULD NO LONGER MOVE.  AFTER REVIEW BY MECHANICS THEY DEEMED THE ISSUE BEING THE TRANSMISSION. THE CAR WAS NEWLY PURCHASED AT 88K MILES. NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY WAS PICKED UP NISSAN AFTER I WAS ASSURED THAT THE NEW CVT WAS GREAT ON THE NEW MODELS.
BRAND NEW VEHICLE JUST SHY OF 1 YEAR BOUGHT AND CHECK ENGINE GOES ON TWICE FOR REPROGRAM OF OXYGEN SENSOR, ONCE IN TOWN BEFORE THANKSGIVING WEEK IN NOVEMBER 2014 AND A SECOND TIME WHILE OUT OF TOWN FOR THE THANKSGIVING HOLIDAYS. FRUSTRATING THAT I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN TO THE DEALER TO GET FIXED AND IT WASN'T DONE THE FIRST TIME. IT LOOKS LIKE THEY JUST CLEARED THE SYSTEM AND THE LIGHT AND IT CAME BACK ON WHILE OUT OF TOWN FOR THE SAME PROBLEM.
CAR INTERMITTENTLY STALLS WITHOUT WARNING. CAR IS UNDER ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER  WARRANTY. CAR DIED ONCE WHILE I WAS IN MOTION DRIVING THROUGH AN INTERSECTION, 3 TIMES WHILE STOPPED ON A HIGHWAY AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT AND ONCE IN MY DRIVEWAY WHILE I WAS MOVING. HAS BEEN TO 2 DIFFERENT DEALERS, 2 TIMES EACH FOR A TOTAL OF 4 REPAIR ATTEMPTS, CONTINUES TO STALL. 5TH REPAIR ATTEMPT SCHEDULED.
JUST PURCHASED NISSAN ALTIMA 2013 SL WITH 24,000 MILES STILL UNDER NEW CAR WARRANTY IN SEPT. PAYING $400 MONTHLY.  ACCIDENTALLY BUMPED COFFEE CUP WHEN GETTING INTO CAR. A FEW WEEKS LATER THE SHIFTER STICKS IN PARK, AND YOU CAN'T GET IT OUT UNLESS YOU PAY NISSAN $1000 TO REPLACE IT.  I PAYED THEM $120 TO CLEAN.  IT DIDN'T WORK.  THE NISSAN NORTH AMERICAN OFFICE CALLED ME TO TELL ME THAT THEY WOULD DO NOTHING.  THIS IS A KNOWN MANUFACTURER DESIGN ISSUE.  MY BOSS HAS A $45,000 NISSAN TITAN, AND HE HAS TO USE A SCREW DRIVER LIKE I DO TO PUSH DOWN IN THE LITTLE OPENING BESIDE THE GEARS. YOU HAVE TO LIFT THE LITTLE BOX LID TO THE LEFT OF THE GEARS.  NISSAN HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS.  I AM SINGLE, AND STRUGGLING TO MAKE THE CAR PAYMENT ALREADY, AND I WORK IN A REAL BAD AREA.  MY SAFETY IS A CONCERN IF I CAN'T LEAVE AS QUICKLY AS I ENTER THE CAR.  NISSAN DENIES THAT THIS IS THEIR FAULT AND IS TRYING TO STICK IT TO NISSAN CONSUMERS.  I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER NISSAN, AND HAVE ALREADY TOLD 2 ALTIMA OWNERS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM, AND WILL TELL EVERYONE I SEE WHO IS CONSIDERING PURCHASING A NISSAN, OR HAS ONE.  THIS HAPPENS WHEN THE CAR IS IN PARK.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING AT 20 MPH AND COMING TO A STOP, THE VEHICLE SHOOK AND THEN STALLED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO A DEALER ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS WHERE THE VEHICLE WAS REPROGRAMMED AND THE TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED BUT THE FAILURE RECURRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 45,800.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA. WHILE DRIVING, THE VEHICLE HESITATED WHEN THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WAS DEPRESSED. THE CONTACT INDICATED THAT THE FAILURE WOULD OCCUR IN BOTH THE DRIVE AND REVERSE POSITION. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 55,000.
THE PASSENGER AIRBAG LIGHT TURNS ON WHEN A PASSENGER IS PRESENT, MEANING IF IN AN ACCIDENT THE AIRBAG WILL NOT DEPLOY. THE DEALER HAS HAD THE CAR IN 5 TIMES FOR THIS ISSUE AND IS NOT ABLE TO REPAIR IT SINCE NOW THE VEHICLE WILL NOT GIVE A CODE TO FIX IT. I WAS ABLE TO GET NISSAN NORTH AMERICA INVOLVED AND THEY SAID THE VEHICLE IS REPAIRED, HOW DO I FEEL SAFE HAVING A PASSENGER IN THAT SEAT WITH OUT CERTAINTY THAT AIRBAG WILL DEPLOY IN AN ACCIDENT. WHEN WE MET WITH [XXX], FROM NISSAN NORTH AMERICA, THE ENGINEER, HE STATED THAT THIS AIRBAG IS UNDER RATED AND CAUSES MORE HARM THAN GOOD. WHY WOULD AN ENGINEER FROM THE FACTORY SAY SOMETHING THIS RIDICULOUS, THIS IS WHY WE BOUGHT THE CAR..FOR THE SAFETY RATINGS AND ALL THE AIRBAGS. HE STATED THEY ONLY CAUSE BLACK EYES AND BROKEN NOSES, TO WHICH I SAID "ITS BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE..,DEATH. I AM NOT FEELING SAFE IN THIS CAR AND HOPE SOMEONE CAN HELP US GET IT RECTIFIED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR
EVEN AFTER BEING REPAIRED FOR A RECALL, THE PASSENGER AIRBAG LIGHT CONTINUES TO BE ON INTERMITTENTLY. THE DEALER DID A SIMPLE INSPECTION AND CLAIMED NO PROBLEM FOUND.  THEY REFUSED TO PERFORM DETAILED INVESTIGATION UNLESS I PAY FOR THE DIAGNOSIS, BECAUSE THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED.  *TR
ONGOING HARD STARTING WHEN WET OR COLD. FINALLY STARTED AFTER GRINDING FOR ABOUT 3 MINUTES. RAN ROUGH AWHILE.ENGINE LIGHT ON NOW. RUNS OK FOR NOW. SUSPECT CRANK OR CAM SENSORS. JUST TURNED 50K MILES. MY 97 ALTIMA IS MORE RELIABLE. ANYONE ELSE REPORTING PROBLEMS LIKE THIS? THIS IS RIDICULOUS.  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING AT APPROXIMATELY 55 MPH, THE AIR BAG WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED ON THE FRONT PASSENGER'S SIDE AND DEACTIVATED. THE FAILURE RECURRED MULTIPLE TIMES. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER. THE TECHNICIAN DIAGNOSED THAT THE OCS SOFTWARE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND REPAIRED UNDER NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 14V138000 (AIR BAGS). THE REMEDY FAILED TO REPAIR THE FAILURE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 100.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE AIR BAG SENSOR ON THE FRONT DRIVERS SIDE MALFUNCTIONED AND FAILED TO ILLUMINATE WHEN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT WAS OCCUPIED. THE AIR BAG SENSOR RANDOMLY ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TO BE INSPECTED AND DIAGNOSED BY AN AUTHORIZED DEALER. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 6,300.
VEHICLE HAS A SHUDDER WHEN DECELERATING FROM 65 TO 60.  HAS PROGRESSIVELY BEEN HAPPENING MORE OFTEN.  IN ADDITION TO THE SHUDDER AT HIGHER SPEEDS, IT NOW HAS STARTED TO SHUDDER AND LACK RESPONSE AT LOWER SPEEDS AT RANDOM.  THE GAS MILEAGE HAS DROPPED AT LEAST 5 MPG SINCE ALL OF THESE ISSUES STARTED.  I HAVE TAKEN TO NISSAN SERVICE TWICE FOR THE SAME ISSUE. BOTH TIMES THE PROBLEM "COULDN'T BE DUPLICATED" AND THERE ISN'T A CODE THAT SHOWS ANYTHING WRONG ON COMPUTER DIAGNOSTICS.  ALL SEARCHES FOR THESE ISSUES IN RELATION TO A 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA 3.5 SL, RETURN NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEMS AND NO RESOLUTION.   CURRENT MILEAGE IS15,000.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD TO KEEP ALL  REPORTS FROM SERVICE SO IF THERE IS A PROBLEM LATER I HAVE DOCUMENTATION THAT IT HAS BEEN AN ONGOING ISSUE.  IT APPEARS NISSAN SHOULD GET IN FRONT OF THIS PROBLEM QUICKLY AS IT IS NOT LEAVING A GOOD MARK ON THEIR NAME TO HAVE SUCH NEW VEHICLES WITH THIS DRASTIC OF A PROBLEM.  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA. WHILE DRIVING 35 MPH, THE HOOD DETACHED FROM THE VEHICLE AND LANDED ON THE WINDSHIELD. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO A DEALER FOR DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED AND THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 35,000.
I HAVE HAD MAJOR ISSUES WITH THIS VEHICLE SINCE THE THIRD DAY AFTER PURCHASE. THE BRAKES HAVE MALFUNCTIONED. THE BRAKE LIGHT WOULD INTERMITTENTLY COME ON AND I HAD IT IN SEVERAL TIMES, BUT THE DEALERSHIP COULD NEVER "DUPLICATE" ANYTHING. THEN THE CAR STARTED TO MISFIRE AND EMIT A THICK BLACK SMOKE FROM EXHAUST. I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AND AT FIRST THEY SAID IT WAS NORMAL BECAUSE THE CAR HAS A CVT TRANSMISSION. THEN THEY SAID BRING IT IN FOR ASSESSMENT. A SERVICE TECHNICIAN TEST DROVE WITH ME AND EXPERIENCED THIS FIRST HAND. I WAS TOLD THEY COULD NOT SERVICE IT THAT DAY, BUT TO BRING IT BACK IN. WHEN I TOOK IT BACK A WEEK LATER, THEY "COULD NOT DUPLICATE" THE PROBLEM. THERE HAS BEEN MUCH BACK AND FORTH. I ASKED THEM TO BUY THE CAR BACK BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS WERE LIFE THREATENING. THE CAR ACTUALLY SHUT OFF ON ME, TWICE, IN TRAFFIC. WHEN I LAST CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP, ON JULY 24TH, 2014, ABOUT THE MAJOR ISSUES I'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING; THE EARLIEST THEY SAID THEY COULD SEE ME WOULD BE ON AUGUST 11TH, 2014. ON YESTERDAY, IT FINALLY SHUT OFF FOR GOOD, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSTATE. AS I WAS ON A TRIP, I HAD TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED 125 MILES TO MY HOMETOWN DEALERSHIP AT THE COST OF $230.00, OUT OF POCKET. THE ONLY REASON I GOT IT HOME THAT CHEAPLY WAS BECAUSE I HAVE FOUR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE COVERAGE PACKAGES AND LUCKILY ONE OF THEM COVERED TOWING UP TO 100 MILES. THE CAR IS NOW SITTING ON THE DEALERSHIP'S PARKING LOT.   *JS
I WAS DRIVING MY CAR ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN IT STARTED TO SHUTTER. IT WAS FIRST HAPPENING ON INCLINES THEN ALL THE TIME. IT EVENTUALLY JUST SLOWED DOWN AND I HAD TO QUICKLY EXIT TO AVOID GETTING STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY. I HAVE BROUGHT THE SHUTTERING/JERKING ISSUE TO THE DEALER PREVIOUSLY AND WAS TOLD THAT NO ISSUE WAS FOUND. NOW I AM TOLD THAT I HAVE TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION WHICH IS $3,500. AFTER DOING SOME INTERNET SEARCHES I LEARNED THAT SEVERAL OTHER DRIVERS ARE HAVING ISSUES WITH THE TRANSMISSION ON THEIR "NEW" NISSAN ALTIMA (2013).  *TR
MY 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA WANDERS LT AND RT ON THE INTERSTATE AT SPEEDS FROM 65-75 MPH. IT IS EVEN MORE NOTICEABLE WITH WINDS 10+ MPH. YOU HAVE TO GRIP THE STEERING WHEEL TIGHT WITH BOTH HANDS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WANDER INTO OTHER LANES OR OFF THE ROAD. THIS PROBLEM IS EVEN MULTIPLIED WHEN IT IS RAINING, IF FEELS LIKE THE CAR IS HYDRO-PLANING. IT IS SCARY AND DANGEROUS. AFTER RESEARCHING THIS ON GOOGLE I FOUND MULTIPLE SITES WHERE 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME THING. I ONLY HAVE 9,000 MILES ON THIS CAR AND FEEL LIKE IT IS DANGEROUS TO DRIVE ON THE INTERSTATE. THE DEALERSHIP SAYS THEY ARE LOOKING INTO IT, WE ALL KNOW THEY ARE NOT GOING TO ADMIT TO ANYTHING. WHAT SHOULD MY NEXT STEP BE?   *JS
THE PASSENGER SEAT AIRBAG SENSOR FAILS TO NOTICE A 110 POUND  PASSENGER IN THE SEAT. THIS RESULTS IN A WARNING ON THE DISPLAY THAT THE PASSENGER AIRBAG IS DISABLED. THE FIRST INCIDENT WAS LAST FALL. THE DATE AND MILEAGE ABOVE IS JUST A GUESS, THE SECOND TIME WAS ON OR ABOUT MARCH 20, 2014 WHEN THE WARNING REMAINED ON FOR ABOUT 5 MILES OR UNTIL I STOPPED AND RESTARTED THE CAR AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT. IT HAPPENED AGAIN APRIL 5, 2013. THE WARNING STAYED ON UNTIL I SHUT OFF THE ENGINE AND THEN RESTARTED IT. I AM NOT SURE BUT IT MAY BE AFFECTED BY WHETHER OF NOT HER SEAT BELT BUCKLE IS ENGAGED BEFORE OR AFTER THE CAR IS STARTED. (PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS MY WIFE'S CAR AND THEIR IS SELDOM ANYONE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.) THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE IN 2013 AND THERE HAS BEEN AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF A NEW RECALL STARTING SOON. BOTH RECALLS ARE ONLY FOR SELECTED VIN NUMBERS AND NEITHER INCLUDES OUR ALTIMA. I CHECKED WITH NISSAN CORPORATE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WITH THE DEALER AND THEY BOTH CONFIRMED THE RECALLED VEHICLES DO NOT INCLUDE OUR CAR. THE CAR IS TITLED TO MY WIFE [XXX].

THE ORANGE PASSENGER AIR BAG LIGHT (UNDERNEATH HAZARD LIGHTS BUTTON) COMES ON WHEN A FULL-GROWN ADULT (150 LBS) IS SEATED IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. THIS MEANS THAT THE AIRBAG WOULD NOT DEPLOY IF I CRASH WITH THEM IN THE PASSENGER SEAT, WHICH MAKES ME VERY NERVOUS ABOUT SAFETY. IT DOES NOT HAPPEN EVERY SINGLE TIME, BUT ABOUT 75% OF THE TIME A FULL-GROWN ADULT IS SEATED IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. I'VE TAKEN IT TO NISSAN DEALERS, AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIX IT.  *TR
SINCE I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE IN JUNE I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE AIR BAG LIGHT WILL GO ON FOR THE PASSENGER SEAT WHEN SOMEONE OVER 100 LBS IS SITTING THERE.  I TOOK IT IN TODAY AND THEY TESTED THE SENSOR AND RESET IT.  THEY SAID THAT EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL AND IF IT DID IT AGAIN TO TURN OFF THE CAR AND HAVE THE PASSENGER SIT PROPERLY ON THE SEAT AND NOT HALF WAY.  IT IS INTERMITTENT AND HAPPENS ONLY OCCASIONALLY.  I KNOW THAT THE PASSENGERS ARE SITTING FULLY ON THE SEAT AND WORRY THAT THE AIR BAG IS NOT GOING TO WORK WHEN IT IS SUPPOSED TO.  I SEE SEVERAL POSTINGS ON YOUTUBE ABOUT THIS SAME PROBLEM AND CUSTOMERS COMPLAINING THAT THEIR DEALERS CAN'T FIND THE PROBLEM AND TO BRING IT IN WHEN THE LIGHT IS ON.  I ALSO NOTICED A RECALL FOR OCCUPANT SENSORS ON THIS MODEL AND WONDER IF THIS PROBLEM IS RELATED.  *TR

MY FAMILY AND I WERE HEADING DOWN A MAJOR HIGHWAY INTO A METRO AREA FOR THE EVENING AND THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT NEARLY CAUSING ME TO HIT A WALL ON AN EXIT RAMP. THIS IS ONLY ONE OF SEVERAL ISSUES I HAVE HAD WITH THE VEHICLE, THIS ONE BEING THE MOST SERIOUS. I WILL BE SEEKING TO RETURN THE VEHICLE FOR FULL REFUND AS I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS CAR IS SAFE. PLEASE PUSH NISSAN TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES.  *TR
SEAT FRAME WITH NEW SENSOR REPLACED AS PER 2013 ALTIMA RECALL STATING THAT THE AIR BAG LIGHT COMES ON WHEN PASSENGER IS IN THE SEAT.  ZERO POINT RESET WAS DONE AS WELL.  MULTIPLE TIMES SINCE THEN OVER THE LAST 3 MONTHS HAVE HAD MULTIPLE OCCURRENCES OF PASSENGERS OF VARIOUS WEIGHTS SIT IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT AND THE LIGHT HAS REMAINED LIT FROM VEHICLE START, OR ILLUMINATED AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME AFTER STARTING TO DRIVE.  *TR
I HEAR A VIBRATION COMING FROM OUTSIDE OF MY DRIVERS DOOR AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER AND THE FIRST TIME THEY TOLD ME THEY COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM(EVEN THOUGH I KNEW WHEN I DROPPED THIS CAR OFF THAT THERE IS A SERVICE BULLETIN FOR THIS EXACT PROBLEM). I TOLD THEM THIS WHEN I PICKED IT UP AND THEY TOLD ME THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PARTS YET. IT KEPT MAKING THE NOISE WHILE DRIVING SO I BROUGHT IT BACK THE SECOND TIME AND THEY SAID THEY COMPLETED THE SERVICE BULLETIN BY INSTALLING SOME DOUBLE SIDED TAPE. NOW JUST OVER A WEEK LATER I AM HEARING THE NOISE STILL.  *TR
WHEN THE SUNROOF IS OPENED AND YOU'RE DRIVING IT RATTLES LIKE CRAZY. IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS SOMETHING LOOSE IN THE SUNROOF AND WHENEVER YOU GO OVER A BUMP OR AN ANGLE IT GETS WORSE.

2013 NISSAN ALTIMA SV PURCHASED  02/2013 VEHICLE HAS 1732 MILES WHINING NOISE  FROM POWER STEERING IS UNBEARABLE STEERING IS NOT TOO GOOD FEELS LIKE WANDERING. BROUGHT BACK TO DEALER AND WAS TOLD NISSAN IS WORKING ON IT. FILED A COMPLAINT WITH NISSAN CORPORATE AND WAS ASSIGNED A CASE MANAGER WHO SAID THAT THIS WAS ONLY THE SECOND TIME SHE HEARD OF THIS HAPPENING WELL THAT S A LIE BECAUSE THE DEALER SAID IT IS HAPPENING AND MORE THAN TWICE SOMEONE NEEDS TO CHECK THIS OUT POWER STEERING UNIT.  *TR
THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT HAS BEEN COMING ON AT RANDOM TIMES WHEN SOMEONE IS SITTING IN THE SEAT.  IT HAS BEEN DOING THIS SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR.  THE LIGHT INDICATES THAT THE AIRBAG IS OFF.  THE DEALER HAS RESET THE SEAT TWO TIME AND THE PROBLEM IS NOT SOLVED.  I CHECKED ONLINE AND FOUND THAT OTHERS HAVE BEEN HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM.  THE DEALER HAS INDICATED THAT NISSAN HAS PUT A HOLD ON PARTS FOR THAT SEAT.  THEY OBVIOUSLY KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM.  I AM SERIOUSLY CONCERNED THAT SOMEONE SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT CAN BE AT RISK IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT.  IF NISSAN WON'T TELL THEIR OWN DEALERS WHAT IS GOING ON THAT IS A PROBLEM.  *TR
I HAVE OWNED THIS 2013 ALTIMA FOR 5 MONTHS AND THE PASSENGER AIRBAGS CONTINUOUSLY STAY ON "OFF MODE".  I AM A FEMALE AND WEIGH 136 POUNDS AND MY HUSBAND RIDES ON THE PASSENGER SIDE AS WELL AT TIMES AND HE IS 160 POUNDS, SO THERE IS DEFINITELY ENOUGH WEIGHT. I BELIEVE THERE IS A DEFECT WITHIN THE SENSORS. IN MY VEHICLE IT WILL STAY OFF FOR HOURS OR SOMETIMES IT WILL TAKE 15-30 MINUTES AND IT WILL TURN ON, BUT IT NEVER STAYS ON.I HAVE SEEN SEVERAL COMPLAINTS WITH THE SAME ISSUE. AND IT COULD BE LIFE THREATENING TO A PASSENGER IN ONE OF THESE VEHICLES IF THE AIRBAGS DO NOT DEPLOY IN A CRASH. NISSAN NEEDS TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THIS ISSUE BEFORE SOMEONE LOSES THERE LIFE. THERE IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING WRONG AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE QUICKLY TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE ITS A SERIOUS MATTER. THERE ARE LIVES AT STAKE HERE..  *TR

I just bought a 2014 Nissan Altima as is from a Nissan Dealer. As the car warms up I'm getting carbon monoxide fumes coming into the car.  Car was purchased at Nissan dealership as is!     I took it to an auto shop and according to the computer it doesn't show any dash light warnings and cannot find the source of the problem.  The car cost me $23,000.00! [XXX]  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).
The contact owns a 2014 Nissan Altima. The contact stated that after obtaining the vehicle, it was discovered that while driving at night, the low-beam headlights did not properly illuminate and were extremely dim causing a visibility hazard to the driver. The cause of the failure was not yet determined. The local dealer and manufacturer were not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was 119,000.
Headlight recall is not being done even though the dealership did the test and said lights failed. I'm on month 4 waiting for a replacement. Claim code# NIZ-11408256001-1145581.  Dealership info: Five Star Nissan - 839 Warren Dr, Warner Robins, GA 31088.
The car has dangerously dim headlights. I can barely see ahead of me at night. I live in Florida and was driving in the rain at night (not by choice) and I had to go extremely slow because I could not see a thing. I contacted the dealer but they said I do not qualify for the headlight recall and I recently got the car serviced and my headlights passed inspection.   However, I’ve read many complaints online from other owners with dim lights that Nissan dealerships are passing.
The rear lower control arm snapped on the vehicle and Nissan is aware of this issue through p9324 that I found online.  Per the online information it is only covering 13 models in the salt belt states in the US and 13 & 14 models in Canada.  This is a very dangerous condition and should be a recall of all models and years that have these parts installed in all salt belt areas.
The contact owns a 2014 Nissan Altima. The contact stated that while driving approximately 50 MPH, a grinding sound was present coming from the rear of the vehicle. While driving over a bump in the road, the rear of the vehicle collapsed. The vehicle was taken to the local dealer who diagnosed that the rear suspension had detached, and the front and rear axles were faulty and needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not yet repaired. Additionally, the front low-beam headlights had stopped operating and the bulbs were replaced but the failure recurred. The manufacturer was not yet contacted regarding the failure. The failure mileage was 150,000
The contact's wife owns a 2014 Nissan Altima. The contact stated that at start-up, the air bag warning light illuminated on the instrument panel. The contact took the vehicle to a dealer and was informed to call the manufacturer to see if the repair would be covered under warranty. The manufacturer agreed to pay 60% for the cost of the repair; however, once the repair was performed, the failure persisted. The contact returned the vehicle to the same dealer and the manufacturer agreed to pay for the full repair of the air bag unit. Despite the second repair, the failure persisted, and the manufacturer stated that the repair was no longer covered. The vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 80,000.
The contact owns a 2014 Nissan Altima. The contact stated while driving 35 mph, a popping sound came from the rear of the vehicle, which resulted in the vehicle losing the ability to properly steer. The contact pulled over and upon inspection, it was found that the driver’s side control arm had separated from the sub-frame of the vehicle. The contact stated that the low traction warning light was illuminated. The vehicle was towed to the residence and remained unrepaired. The manufacturer was informed of the failure. The contact was informed that Vin was not included in a recall. The failure mileage was approximately 194,000.
THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH 2013-2015 ALTIMAS. THE HEADLAMP PROJECTOR BOWLS DETERIORATE AND DO NOT PROJECT THE LIGHT CAUSING A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE YOU CANNOT SEE THE ROAD AHEAD. NISSAN IS DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT. I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THE EXPENSIVE BULBS TWICE WITH BRIGHTER BULBS AND THIS DID NOT RECTIFY THE PROBLEM. THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL!!!!!
LIGHTS ARE EXTREMELY DIM. A SAFETY HAZARD THAT HAS BEEN NAMED NUMEROUS TIMES ONLINE. NISSAN IS AWARE AND HAS DONE NOTHING TO REMEDY THE POOR MANUFACTURING.
I WAS DRIVING WHEN MY CAR STARTED TO JERK AND A SLIP INDICATOR LIGHT APPEARS ON THE DASHBOARD BUT I CONTINUED DRIVING ON CITY STREET. I GOT TO A LIGHT ABOUT TO TURN AND THE CAR WOULD NOT GO FORWARD BUT ONLY ROLL BACK. IT?S THE CVT TRANSMISSION  CAR WAS LOST  POWER P0776 CODE WAS FOUND
HEADLIGHTS ARE USELESS ON LOW BEAM. IT'S LIKE DRIVING WITH FLASHLIGHTS TAPED TO THE CAR.   DRIVING AT NIGHT IS VERY DANGEROUS. A SEARCH ON INTERNET REVEALS PAGES OF NISSAN ALTIMA OWNERS WITH THE SAME COMPLAINT.  WHY IS NISSAN NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT THIS VERY DANGEROUS DEFECT?
DRIVING SLOW IN A 25MPH NEIGHBORHOOD MADE A TURN HEARD A CLUNK THOUGHT I HAD A FLAT TURNED AROUND LESS THAN A 1/2 A MILE BACK HOME LESS THAN A BLOCK. HAD I MADE IT TO THE FREEWAY THE RESULTS COULD'VE BEEN MUCH WORSE. CALLED MY MECHANIC AND HE ORDERED A PART, DECIDED TO LOOK AND IT SEEMS THIS MAY BE A PROBLEM WITH THESE CARS
THE SYSTEM THAT DETERMINES WHETHER THE PASSENGER AIRBAG WILL DEPLOY ON MY VEHICLE IS NOT FUNCTIONING AND IS DEFAULTING THE AIRBAG TO NOT DEPLOY. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO MY DEALER FOR A QUOTE AND WAS TOLD IT WILL COST UP TO $1,800.00 TO FIX. I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN AT LEAST ONE RECALL PERTAINING TO THIS SYSTEM ALREADY (RECALL NUMBER 15V681000). I ALSO ASKED IF THERE WAS A WAY TO HAVE THE AIRBAG ALWAYS SET TO DEPLOY BUT WAS TOLD THAT WAS NOT POSSIBLE. AN $1,800.00 FIX FOR A CRITICAL SAFETY FEATURE IS A HAZARD THAT WILL DRIVE PEOPLE TO ACCEPT UNDUE RISK. A RECALL FOR AFFECTED NISSAN VEHICLES TO REPLACE THE SYSTEM OR WHICH WOULD DEFAULT THE AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY WOULD MITIGATE THE RISK TO THE POPULATION.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 NISSAN ALTIMA. THE CONTACT STATED WHILE DRIVING 65 MPH, WHEN THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO HESITATE. THE CONTACT STATED NO WARNING LIGHT WAS ILLUMINATED.

PULLED INTO A HANDICAP PARKING PLACE, ALL OF A SUDDEN THE CAR ACCELERATED FORWARD AT A HIGH SPEED. KNOCKING DOWN THE HANDICAP SIGN AND WENT THROUGH A STORE GLASS WINDOW.WE SAT THERE IN SHOCK NOT NOTHING WHAT JUST HAPPENED. THE POLICE ARRIVED AND A SAID IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE GAS PEDAL, THEY ASSUME SINCE I WAS A OLDER PERSON THAT I HAD STEPPED ON THE GAS PEDAL INSTEAD OF THE BRAKE. I KNOW I HAD MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE. I FEEL THIS IS DIFFERENTLY A RECALL PROBLEM. NISSAN HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM SINCE 2000 AND NO ONE HAS DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I HAVE LOST MY LICENSE AND MY INSURANCE OVER THIS. PLEASE TAKE THIS MATTER SERIOUSLY! WHAT IF THIS WAS A SCHOOL CROSSWALK AND CHILDREN WERE GOING ACROSS. I WORKED IN THE HOSPITAL FOR 47 YEARS NOW IT'S TIME FOR ME TO TRAVEL AND ENJOY MY RETIREMENT. I CAN'T EVEN GO TO THE DOCTORS OR GROCERY STORES. PLEASE SAVE OUR CHILDREN AND OUR COMMUNITY. THE VEHICLE WAS IN PARK AT THE TIME THIS HAPPED.
ON TUESDAY NIGHT JANUARY 14, 2020 I DO AS I ALWAYS DO THIS NIGHT AND DRIVE MY SON TO HIS HOCKEY PRACTICE FOR 6 PM IN NORTH SMITHFIELD RHODE ISLAND. WE WERE ON THE HIGHWAY ROUTE 295 IN TRAVEL LANE PASSING AN 18 WHEELER TRUCK. WHEN WE WERE NEXT TO THIS TRUCK IT FELT LIKE A GUST OF WIND CAME OUT OF NO WHERE AND PUSHED MY 2014 NISSAN ALTIMA IN HIS LANE AND ALMOST HIT THIS TRUCK. I WENT TO CORRECT THE WHEEL TO MOVE AWAY FROM THIS AND THE CAR ALMOST WENT RIGHT OFF THE HIGHWAY IN A DITCH. I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING ON AND WAS ABLE TO KEEP THE CAR STRAIGHTENED OUT. MY SON, WHO IS 11 WAS SCARED TO DEATH. I NOTICED THAT THAT A LIGHT ON DASHBOARD CAME ON THAT LOOKS LIKE A TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT OR SLIPPERY ROAD LIGHT. WHERE THIS HAPPENED, THE PRACTICE WE GO TO WAS NEXT EXIT AND RIGHT OFF THE HIGHWAY. WE DECIDED TO HEAD THERE SINCE THERE WAS NO SAFE SPOT TO PULL OVER IN THIS LOCATION AT NIGHT. I PUT THE HAZARD LIGHT ON AND MANAGED TO GET THEIR SLOWLY SOMEHOW SO I COULD LOOK INTO WHAT THIS PROBLEM WAS. WE GOT TO PRACTICE. MY SON WENT IN AND I LOOKED AROUND AT WHAT THIS LIGHT WAS THAT CAME ON DASHBOARD. I COULD NOT FIND IT IN MANUAL ANYWHERE AND WAS THINKING THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN A COMPUTER ISSUE. FROM THERE I CHECKED THE OUTSIDE OF THE CAR AND UNDER THE BEST I COULD AND DID NOT NOTICE ANYTHING AT THIS TIME SO I LEFT IT ALONE. WHEN IT WAS TIME TO LEAVE MY PLAN WAS JUST TO TAKE IT SLOW AND DRIVE HOME. WE MADE IT ABOUT 200 FEET OUT OF PARKING LOT AND HEARD A NASTY NOISE AND PULLED RIGHT OVER ON ROUTE 146 IN NORTH SMITHFIELD R.I. I LOOKED UNDER CAR WHERE I HEARD THE NOISE AND COULD SEE SOMETHING BROKEN. I TOOK AN PICTURE - CALLED MY MECHANIC RIGHT AWAY TO FIND OUT WHAT IT WAS..IT WAS A CONTROL ARM AND WERE EXTREMELY LUCKY WE WERE NOT INVOLVED IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT OR HURT IN ANYWAY,  FOUND OUT THE OTHER CONTROL ARM WAS READY TO BREAK  HTTPS://PHOTOS.APP.GOO.GL/IEGG5SVV4CSQNNVR6    I
STARTING IN APRIL 2019 ON MY 2014 NISSAN ALTIMA SV. THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS ARE EXTREMELY DIM. THEY ARE EASILY OVERPOWERED BY THE TURN SIGNAL, AND HEADLIGHTS FROM OTHER VEHICLES CAST A "SHADOW" WHEN DRIVING BEHIND THIS VEHICLE. THIS PRESENTS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD ESPECIAL IN ANY WET WEATHER EVENT IT IS ALMOST LIKE HAVING NO LIGHTS ON AT ALL. IF THERE IS A MINIMUM LUMENS THAT NEED TO BE PROJECTED TO THE ROAD THIS DESIGN IS NOT DOING IT.   THE BULBS WERE REPLACED WITH APPROPRIATE UNITS, NO CHANGE IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LIGHTS.    WHEN I CONTACTED NISSAN ABOUT THIS SAFETY DEFECT THEY PROVIDED NO SOLUTION. AND TOOK ZERO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COMPANIES DESIGN FLAW.

TAKATA RECALL    MY 2014 NISSAN ALTIMA STARTED LOSING POWER AND STALLING WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAYS BACK IN MAY 2019 WITH NO INDICATION WHY AS THERE WAS NO 'CHECK ENGINE LIGHT' AND IT WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE DEALER AND WHATEVER THEY TOLD ME TO REPAIR I DID. IT CONTINUED SPORADICALLY STALLING (LOSING POWER DOWN TO UNDER 30MPH)IN JUNE, JULY,AUGUST & NOW SEPTEMBER-DURING THIS TIME WE HAVE REPLACED THE BATTERY, CHANGE THE FILTERS, FINALLY TUNING UP THE CAR LAST WEEK WEDNESDAY! DIDN'T DRIVE IT THURSDAY-MONDAY NOW THIS MORNING TUESDAY IT STALLED AND START LOSING POWER AGAIN! STILL NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND NOW AFTER TAKING IT BACK TO THE DEALER THIS MORNING I WAS JUST CALLED BY CONICELLI SERVICE REP TELLING ME THE TRANSMISSION IS GONE!!! AT 125000 - 5YRS OLD  ! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE BECAUSE THIS IS OUR 8TH NISSAN AND ALL THE PREVIOUS ONES LAST UP TO 27700 MILES AND NEVER REPLACED A TRANSMISSION!! THIS IS DEFINITELY A LEMON AND NISSAN USA NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING! REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION OR BUY IT BACK!!
WHEN COMING TO A STOP SIGN OR A RED LIGHT THE CAR SHUTS DOW. AND THE CAR BUCKS WHEN YOU TRY TO START IT AGAIN. AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS IT MAY OT MAY NOT START AGAIN. THE CAR WAS IN MOTION WHEN THIS HAPPENED.
THE LOW  BEAM LIGHTS ON MY 2014 NISSAN ALTIMA  ARE SO LOW THAT YOU CANNOT SEE AT NIGHT.  I HAVE CHANGE THE BULBS 2 TIMES AND I'M STILL GETTING THE SAME RESULTS.  I TOOK IT TO MY LOCAL SHOP AND THEY  SUGGESTED ME CHANGING OUT BOTH HEAD LIGHTS. WHY HAVEN'T THIS ISSUE BEEN RECALL BY NISSAN?
"TAKATA RECALL"  I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE IN OCTOBER 2018. SINCE THE PURCHASE, MY LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS HAVE MADE ME RUN COMPLETELY OFF OF THE ROAD ONCE AND ALMOST GOT HIT BY ANOTHER VEHICLE BECAUSE OF THE SEVERELY DIM; ALMOST NON-EXISTENT LOW BEAMS. THEREFORE I HAVE BEEN FORCED TO DRIVE AT NIGHT USING ONLY MY HIGH BEAMS BECAUSE AS A SINGLE MOTHER OF 4, I CANNOT AFFORD TO REPLACE OR REPAIR ENTIRE ASSEMBLE. I HAVE REPLACED THE BULBS A COUPLE TIMES AND WAS TOLD BY A MECHANIC AT LOCAL PARTS STORE THAT THE "PROJECTOR" HAS OBVIOUSLY GONE OUT AND THAT ALL ALTIMA WITH THAT TYPE OF LIGHTS EXPERIENCE ISSUE. PLEASE HELP ME.
1) FRONTAL PASSENGER AIR BAG. IT ALWAYS SAYS OFF, EVEN WHEN THERE'S A PASSENGER. I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THIS IS A TAKATA INFLATOR. (THIS OCCURS EVERY TIME ALL THE TIME WHEN THE ENGINE IS RUNNING, WETHER IDLEING, DRIVE, NEUTRAL AND REVERSE)  2) HEADLIGHTS. THE HEADLIGHTS (BOTH) CONTINUALLY GET DIMMER AND DIMMER UNTIL YOU ARE UNABLE TO SEE CAUSING A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION. (THIS OCCURS EVERY TIME ALL THE TIME WHEN THE ENGINE IS RUNNING, WETHER IDLEING, DRIVE, NEUTRAL AND REVERSE)I HAVE HAD OR CHANGED MY LIGHT BULB(S) AT LEAST (6) TIMES IN THE 16 MONTHS I HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE. I HAVE BEEN STOPPED BY LAW INFORCEMENT SEVERAL TIMES AND A LIVERY DRIVER I HAVE HAD CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS.
THE BULBS ARE FADING AND HAVE BEEN REPLACED. MY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY OWNER FINDING THIS PROBLEM.
ABOUT FIVE MONTHS AGO BACK IN AUGUST 2018 MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING MY 2014 NISSAN ALTIMA ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN OUT OF NOWHERE IT STALLED. HE EXPLAINED THAT IT JUST STALLED BUT WOULD START BACK UP AND THEN WHEN HE WOULD SHIFT IT INTO DRIVE, IT WOULD STALL OUT AGAIN. WE THEN TOOK IT TO A SHOP AND THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE WHAT IT DID WITH MY HUSBAND. SO, THEY SAID IT MIGHT BE A SOFTWARE ISSUE AND UPDATED IT. FAST FORWARD THIS PAST FRIDAY ON JANUARY 11TH, 2019, I WAS AT A RED STOP SIGN, WHEN OUT OF NOWHERE MY CAR STALLS. I ACTUALLY THOUGHT SOMEONE HAD HIT ME BECAUSE IT JUST JOLTED TO A STOP SO SUDDENLY IT FELT AS IF SOMEONE HIT MY CAR. SAME THING HAPPENED THAT OCCURRED WITH MY HUSBAND. SHUT OFF CAR, RESTARTS PERFECTLY, THEN SHIFT TO DRIVE AND STALLS.  I GET A TOW TRUCK TO TOW IT TO THE LOCAL NISSAN DEALERSHIP. EVEN THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER SAID HE'S NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT, AND THAT HE DROVE IT OFF THE TOW TRUCK NO PROBLEM. I GET A CALL TWO DAYS LATER FROM NISSAN SAYING THAT IT SHOWS UP AS A TRANSMISSION ISSUE AND THAT IT WILL COST AROUND $5,000 TO REPLACE IT. NO EXPLANATION TO WHY A FIVE-YEAR-OLD CAR THAT HAS BEEN PERFECTLY MAINTAINED WOULD NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION. OF COURSE, THE WARRANTY IS ONLY COVERED AT 60,000 MILES SO I HAD NO WAY OF COVERAGE. THAT DAY I DID INVESTIGATING ON WEBSITES TO FIND A RECALL OR ANY INFORMATION. WHAT I FOUND WAS DESCRIBING EXACTLY WHAT OCCURRED WITH MY CAR AND TO LOTS AND LOTS OF PEOPLE WITH THIS VEHICLE! I THEN CONTACTED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND THEY CREATED A CASE NUMBER FOR ME. I JUST RECEIVED A CALL TODAY FROM THEM STATING: "NISSAN WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ASSIST YOU IN ANY WAY."   THIS IS A MANUFACTURING ISSUE WITH EITHER THE TRANSMISSION OR A SOFTWARE ISSUE THAT IS SAYING IT'S A TRANSMISSION ISSUE. THIS NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER FOR THE SAFETY OF THE CONSUMERS OF THIS VEHICLE OR IF PEOPLE ARE BEING WRONGFULLY CHARGED MONEY.
THE LIGHTING ON MY CAR IS EXTREMELY DIM.  I USUALLY HAVE TO RIDE WITH MY BRIGHT LIGHTS ON JUST TO SEE THE ROAD.  WE TRIED CHANGING THE BULBS AND IT DID NOT HELP.  THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD BECAUSE AT NIGHT YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN NOT SEE.  IT HAPPENS ON EVERY ROAD EVERY DAY.
THE HEADLIGHTS HAVE BECOME VERY DIM OVER TIME. BOTH LIGHT BULBS HAVE BEEN REPLACED, BUT IT IS LIKE DRIVING WITH NO HEADLIGHTS!  I OFTEN HAVE TO DRIVE WITH HIGH BEAMS ON SO I CAN SEE AT NIGHT!  HAVING HIGH BEAMS ON IS A DANGER FOR OTHER DRIVERS.  NISSAN IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND WILL NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.  THERE HAS TO BE SOME WAY TO MAKE THEM FIX THE PROBLEM. HOPEFULLY BEFORE SOMEONE IS INJURED OR KILLED BECAUSE OF NISSAN'S NEGLIGENCE!
THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS ARE VERY DIM.  I AM CONCERNED ABOUT DRIVING AT NIGHT AS I CANNOT SEE VERY FAR IN FRONT OF CAR UNLESS I USE HIGH BEAMS. NOTICED LAST YEAR, SEEMS TO BE EVEN WORSE NOW.
WHEN STARTING VEHICLE AND ATTEMPTING TO MOVE GEAR SHIFTER INTO A DIFFERENT GEAR FROM PARK, GEAR SHIFTER WON'T MOVE. AFTER RESTARTING THE VEHICLE MULTIPLE TIMES IS WHEN IT'LL WORK. FOOT IS PRESSED ON BRAKE.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 NISSAN ALTIMA. THE CONTACT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBERS: 16V244000 (AIR BAGS) AND 16V029000 (LATCHES/LOCKS/LINKAGES). THE DEALER (NISSAN AUTOHAUS BCHERL WEIDEN, LOCATED AT BUCHERL JO.-TEC .GMBH NEUSTADTER STR 50 WEIDEN, 92637+ 49 961631-90330, HTTP://WWW.AUTOHAUS-BUECHERL.DE/WEIDEN.HTML) STATED THAT THE PART WAS UNAVAILABLE AND WAS WAITING TO RECEIVE THE PART FROM THE MANUFACTURER TO PROVIDE THE RECALL REPAIR. THE NISSAN USA MANUFACTURER STATED THAT THEY WOULD NOTIFY THE CONTACT BEFORE JUNE 1, 2018 TO DETERMINE IF THE PART WOULD BE AVAILABLE PRIOR TO THE VEHICLE BEING SHIPPED INTERNATIONALLY. THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE. PARTS DISTRIBUTION DISCONNECT.
THE HOOD POPPED OPEN AND FLEW UP WHILE DRIVING, DAMAGE TO THE FENDER ON BOTH SIDES, ROOF AND HOOD. NISSAN RECALLED ALTIMAS THREE TIMES IN THE PAST TO REPAIR HOOD LATCHES THAT CAN CAUSE HOODS TO FLY OPEN HOWEVER THERE IS NO RECALL CAMPAIGN ASSOCIATED WITH ENCLOSED VIN NUMBER. DAMAGES WERE HANDLED BY INSURANCE COMPANY.
TAKANA INFLATORS. RADIO GOES ON AND OFF WHEN I TURN IT TURNS ON AND STAYS ON FOR A FEW SECONDS THEN SHUTS OFF.
PRIOR TO TAKING MY 2014 NISSAN ALTIMA TO A NISSAN SERVICE CENTER FOR A SCHEDULED ROUTINE OIL & FILTER CHANGE, MY VEHICLE WAS RUNNING PERFECTLY. THE VERY NEXT DAY AFTER I HAD MY ROUTINE OIL & FILTER CHANGE ON MY VEHICLE, MY VEHICLE STARTED HESITATING IN FIRST GEAR AND IMMEDIATELY I TOOK MY VEHICLE BACK TO THE NISSAN SERVICE CENTER THE SAME DAY OF THE OCCURRENCE AND I EXPLAINED TO THE NISSAN SERVICE CENTER REPRESENTATIVE THAT MY VEHICLE STARTED HESITATING. (THE DAY AFTER I HAD A SCHEDULED ROUTINE OIL & FILTER CHANGE). WHEN THE NISSAN SERVICE CENTER DIAGNOSED MY VEHICLE I WAS TOLD MY CVT TRANSMISSION INDICATING A BAD INTERNAL SENSOR WITHIN THE TRANSMISSION AND I WOULD NEED TO PAY $3,800 DOLLARS TO REPAIR MY CVT TRANSMISSION. I EXPLAINED TO THE NISSAN SERVICE CENTER REP. MY VEHICLE WAS JUST AT THE NISSAN SERVICE CENTER YESTERDAY FOR A ROUTINE OIL & FILTER CHANGE AND THERE WAS NO WARNING LIGHTS OR WARNING SIGNS ON MY DASHBOARD THAT WOULD INDICATE A PROBLEM WITH MY TRANSMISSION. IN ADDITION TO MY VEHICLE HESITATING IN FIRST GEAR IT ALSO APPEARED NOT TO CHANGE GEARS WHILE I WAS DRIVING IN MOTION ON THE HIGHWAY. I TOLD THE NISSAN REP THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WANTED TO REPAIR MY VEHICLE WAS TO MUCH MONEY AND THE NISSAN REP STATED MY VEHICLE IS PASS THE WARRANTY LIMIT BECAUSE I HAVE 78,000 MILE AND MY LIMIT IS 60,000 MILES TO BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. THE SERVICE REP STATED THEY CAN HAVE A SALES REP CONTACT ME TO PURCHASE A NEW CAR IF I DID NOT WANT TO PAY FOR THE TRANSMISSION REPAIR. AFTER REFUSING TO HAVE MY VEHICLE REPAIRED AT THAT PRICE I PICKED UP MY VEHICLE FROM THE NISSAN SERVICE CENTER AND DROVE MY VEHICLE HOME AND IT RAN FINE WITH NO WARNING LIGHTS OR ANY INDICATION OF ANY PROBLEMS. THE VEHICLE CHANGED GEARS AND DROVE PERFECTLY. I JUST WANT TO REPORT THIS ISSUE AND TO RED FLAG THIS PROBLEM WITH MY 2014 NISSAN ALTIMA. IF SOMEONE'S DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE PLEASE ADVISE.
AFTER TAKING IN MY ALTIMA 2014 SV FOR A RECALL ON THE AIRBAG SENSORS, THE ISSUE DID NOT GO AWAY. THE ISSUE IS THAT THERE IS THAT ABOUT HALF THE TIMES A PASSENGER SITS NEXT TO THE DRIVER SEAT, THE AIRBAG SYSTEM DOES NOT DETECT THEM. I AM HAVING TO RESTART THE CAR FOR SECURITY PURPOSES IN CASE SOMETHING ENDS UP HAPPENING. I AM ALSO HAVING AN ISSUE WITH MY AC SYSTEM. I REPLACED THE COMPRESSOR A YEAR AGO AND IT SEEMS TO BE FAILING AGAIN. AS A SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER I CAN SAFELY SAY THAT THERE IS DEFINITELY AN ISSUE WITH THEIR SOFTWARE. I HOPE THEY CAN FIX THIS SOON.    THANKS,  [XXX]    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).?*JB
NISSAN HAS A RECALL ON THE CVT ON THE 2014 NISSAN ALTIMA, THEY EXTENDED THE WARRANTY FOR SOME, BUT NOT ALL.  I'VE EXPERIENCED MY VEHICLE SHUTTING OFF WHILE DRIVING AND VERY STRONG JERKING, WHICH IS VERY DANGEROUS.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO TISCHER NISSAN IN LAUREL AND THE JERKING AND SHUTTING STOPPED AFTER THEY RESET THE CVT PER THE RECALL.  HOWEVER, IT HAS STARTED AGAIN AND THEY'RE NOW STATING I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CHARGES.  THEY KNOW THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THIS PART, YET THEY WON'T BE ACCOUNTABLE.  IT IS DANGEROUS AND VERY EXPENSIVE AND IT SHOULD BE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY.  THIS IS MY SECOND COMPLAINT AND NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE.
HOOD RELEASED WHILE TRAVELING ON THE HIGHWAY CAUSING SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE AND CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO LEAVE THE ROADWAY.
I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE BRAND NEW FROM THE DEALERSHIP ON 12/31/13.  THIS VEHICLE IS 2 YEARS OLD AND HAS APPROXIMATELY 75,000 MILES ON IT.  IT HAS HAD A MINIMUM OF 2 RECALLS ON IT SINCE I HAD IT.  I WOULD DRIVE THE CAR NEARLY ALL DAY (NO MORE THAN 50 MILES PER DAY) AND SUDDENLY ONCE I APPROACHED A STOP SIGN AT A VERY BUSY INTERSECTION AND WAS ABOUT TO CROSS IT, THE CAR ENGINE SHUT DOWN. I COULD HEAR THE RADIO.  NOTE:  MY TODDLER CHILD WAS WITH ME.  I ATTEMPTED TO START THE VEHICLE SEVERAL TIMES BUT AS SOON AS I PUT IT IN THE DRIVE GEAR, IT WOULD SHUT OFF AGAIN.  I HAD TO SIT TO THE STOP SIGN WITH TRAFFIC APPROACHING FOR NEARLY 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE CAR WOULD ALLOW ME TO START AND PUT IT IN GEAR TO DRIVE IT HOME.  WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR A DIAGNOSTIC TEST, THEY COULD NOT GIVE ME A FULL DIAGNOSIS AS THEY STATED THAT THE VEHICLE HAD TO BE COOLED.  I HAD NO WAY HOME AS I LIVE OUTSIDE OF THE DEALERSHIP'S SHUTTLE RADIUS AND WAS OFFERED A RENTAL CAR BUT I HAD TO PAY FOR IT. I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO TRUST THAT I WOULD MAKE IT BACK HOME WITH IT.  I DID MAKE IT HOME BUT IT SHUT OFF IN THE YARD.  I HAD IT TOWED A FEW DAYS LATER TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR FURTHER TESTING AND IT WAS REVEALED TO ME THAT THE TRANSMISSION HAD TO BE REPLACED.  I AM BOTHERED BY THIS BECAUSE THIS IS A BRAND NEW VEHICLE WITH LESS THAN 100,000 MILES AND IS 2 YEARS OLD.  ALSO, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A SAFETY HAZARD FOR ME AND MY CHILD AS IT COULD HAVE SHUT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION IN WHICH WE WERE CROSSING.

I HAVE A LEASED 2014 NISSAN ALTIMA THAT ON 2 OCCASIONS WHILE DRIVING FAILED TO SHIFT INTO THE NEXT GEAR. THE LAST TIME WAS 08/21/15, THE MALFUNCTION INDICATOR LIGHT CAME ON. I HAD MY KIDS IN THE CAR I COULD NOT MAINTAIN SAFE DRIVING SPEED AND HAD TO PUT ON MY HAZARD LIGHTS, PULL OVER AND RESTART THE CAR TWICE. THE LIGHT STAYED ON BUT THE CAR RESUMED NORMAL FUNCTION. THE NEXT DAY I TOOK IT EARLY TO BAY RIDGE NISSAN DEALER THEY LOOKED AT IT AND SAID THERE WAS A PASS CODE THAT  SHOWED UP BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE CODE MEANT OTHER THAN THERE WAS AN ALERT FROM THE CAR. THE COULDN'T REPLICATE THE PROBLEM OR SAY WHY THE ISSUE HAD HAPPENED OR GIVE ANY GUARANTEES THAT IT WOULD NOT OCCUR AGAIN WHICH IS A POTENTIAL DANGEROUS DRIVING CONDITION BUT  PROCEEDED TO CHARGE ME $260 FOR DIAGNOSTICS ON A NEW CAR I LEASED THAT HAS WARRANTY.
MY CAR IS STALLING ON THE HIGHWAY AND SOMETIMES CUTS OFF AT A LOW SPEED. I TOOK IT TO THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THEY DO NOT SEE ANY ISSUES DUE TO THE ENGINE LIGHT NOT COMING ON. I THINK THIS IS A SAFETY HAZZARD BEING THAT THE CAR COULD TURN OFF AT ANYTIME ON THE HIGHWAY. I'M REALLY CONCERN WHEN MY FAMILY (WIFE & KIDS ARE IN THE CAR. PLEASE HELP!
THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM.  THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ABOVE IS APPROXIMATE AS I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS AN ISSUE UNTIL A RECALL FROM MY NISSAN DEALER ON APRIL 22' 2014.  SINCE THEN I HAVE HAD IT BACK TO THE DEALER TWO MORE TIMES FOR THE SAME INCIDENT ONLY TO BE TOLD IT COULD NOT BE FIXED, BUT THEY GAVE ME A PROCEDURE TO GET AROUND THE ISSUE.    THE ISSUE INVOLVES THE AIR BAG LIGHT ON THE PASSENGERS SIDE STAYING LIT EVEN WHEN THERE IS AN ADULT IN THE SEAT.  THE LIGHT ON MEANS THE PASSENGERS AIR BAG IS DISABLED.  I AM TOLD TO CHECK LIGHT WHILE THE CAR IN ON AND IN PARK AND IF ON, HAVE THE PASSENGER STAY PERFECTLY STILL FOR ABOUT EIGHT SECONDS, UNTIL THE LIGHT GOES OUT.  SOMETIMES THIS WORKS, SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T.  OCCASIONALLY I HAVE TO SHUT OFF THE ENGINE AND RESTART IN ORDER FOR THIS TO WORK.  MOST TIMES, I FORGET TO CHECK THE LIGHT ONLY TO NOTICE IT ON WHILE DRIVING.  THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.   I WORRY ABOUT NOT NOTICING AND HAVING A FRONT END ACCIDENT.   SURELY IN THIS DAY AND AGE NISSAN ENGINEERS CAN FIND A FIX.  *TR
VEHICLE IS DRIVEN SEVERAL MILES SO THE ENGINE IS WARM. THREE TIMES THE CAR HAS STALLED WHEN STOPPING AT A LIGHT OR SLOWING AT AN INTERSECTION TO MAKE A LEFT TURN. WHEN MOVING FROM THE WAITING POSITION THE CAR WILL STALL AND AS AN ONCOMING CAR IS COMING POSES A LEFT THREATENING SITUATION AS IT WILL NOT MOVE FORWARD IMMEDIATELY. CAR HAS BEEN TAKEN TO NISSAN DEALERSHIP 2 TIMES AND BOTH TIMES NOTHING SHOWS ON THE COMPUTER. ALSO, THE CAR WAS DRIVEN THE LAST TIME AND THE STALL IS NOT REPLICATED. BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS NOT REPLICATED NISAAN REFUSES TO ADMIT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE CAR ALTHOUGH A LIFE IS IN JEOPARDY DUE TO THE DANGER OF MAKING A LEFT HAD TURN IN FRONT OF TRAFFIC WHEN THERE IS AMPLE TIME TO MAKE THE TURN. I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE NATIONAL OFFICE AND THEY REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING SINCE THE COMPUTER SAYS THE CAR IS NOT BROKEN.  *TR
THIS CAR MAKES A LOT OF NOISES WHEN STOPPING AT MOST SPEEDS! YOU CAN HEAR GAS MOVING AROUND INSIDE OF THE CAR LIKE YOUR AT THE BEACH SOUNDS LIKE WAVES HITTING UP AGAINST A BOAT DOCKED!  HAS BEEN TO SEVERAL DEALERSHIPS AND NO ONE WILL OWN UP TO IT INCLUDING NISSAN CUSTOMER SERVICES! I'M WORRIED FOR MY SAFETY AND OTHERS!  *TR
OVER 65MPH THE CAR BECAME UNSTABLE AND CONSTANT STEERING INPUTS WERE NEEDED TO STAY IN MY LANE.  CAR DIDN'T TRACK VERY WELL THRU CORNERS AND WAS VERY TIRING TO DRIVE.  *TR
ON THE THIRD DAY OF OWNING THIS VEHICLE, I TOOK IT ON THE INTERSTATE. THIS VEHICLE HAS THE WORST HANDLING OF ANY CAR I HAVE EVER DRIVEN. IT DRIFTS ALL OVER THE ROAD WITH LITTLE CONTROL. IF YOU ARE IN A CROSSWIND OR BEHIND A TRUCK, THE VEHICLE DRIFTS HORRIBLY TOO. YOU MUST HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON THE STEERING WHEEL TO KEEP CORRECTING TO STAY IN YOUR LANE! THIS IS A VERY UNSAFE VEHICLE. I AM VERY UNCOMFORTABLE DRIVING THIS ON THE INTERSTATE. THIS HAPPENS MOSTLY AT HIGH SPEEDS UNLESS IT IS A BREEZY DAY, THEN IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME EVEN AT SLOWER SPEEDS. YOU CAN BE DRIVING STRAIGHT FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE CAR DRIFTS HARD TO ONE SIDE. YOU HAVE TO CORRECT QUICKLY IN ORDER TO NOT GO INTO THE NEXT LANE. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS. I HAVE HAD THIS INTO MY DEALERSHIP TWICE AND THE FIRST TIME THEY TOLD ME NOTHING WAS WRONG. I JUST NEEDED TO GET USED TO THE WAY IT DRIVES. THE SECOND TIME, THEY ADJUSTED THE REAR ALIGNMENT AND CHANGED OUT TIRES TO MICHELIN TIRES. THIS HELPED A LITTLE BIT BUT DID NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM. NOW THE REAR END VIBRATES AND DRIFTS. I HAVE HAD THIS CAR FOR 3 MONTHS AND I CANNOT BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN NO RECALL ON THIS. SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET SERIOUSLY HURT OR KILLED IF SOMETHING IS NOT CORRECTED.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE FOR SURE!   *TR
THE SUNLIGHT REFLECTS OFF OF THE BEIGE AND GLOSSY BLACK INTERIOR FINISHES AND CAUSES A MIRROR IMAGE OF THE INTERIOR SURFACES/GLARE ONTO THE FRONT AND REAR WINDSHIELDS. THE GLARE ON THE GLASS IS VERY BRIGHT AND MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE TRAFFIC LIGHTS AND TRAFFIC SIGNS AS WELL AS ANY OTHER OBJECT IN THE GLARE ZONE. THE GLARE ZONE RANGES BETWEEN 20 TO 50% OF THE WINDSHIELD AREA. THIS DESIGN FAULT WAS CORRECTED IN OTHER NISSAN CARS BUT NOT IN THE ALTIMA. I CONTACTED NISSAN AND WAS ADVISED "NO CORRECTION CAN BE MADE AT THIS TIME". *TR
the headlights are very bad and have to basically drive with the high beams on in order to see because on low beam i almost ran someone over i changed the bulbs a few times but it has not improved any and while changing them that it seems as the bulb burnt something. I have been on the nissan forums and theres many complaints saying that nissan knows something is faulty and they refuse to recall and fix it
Head lights dim; can barely see at night.
I bought a used 2014 nissan altima. The dim lights do not work properly and is dangerous to myself, my familiy and to other drivers approaching me. Visibility is about a cars length,  if that. The dealership i bought the car from did not disclose that there had been a lawsuit against nissan for this issue. Someone needs to issue a recall on all these models with defective headlights before someone is seriously injured and I would be surprised to find that there hasn't already been. Im making payments on a car I cannot drive at night.  PLEASE SOMEONE HELP!!!!!!
The contact owns a 2015 Nissan Altima. The contact stated while driving 60 MPH, the hood and the trunk unintendedly opened. Additionally, the rear driver’s side window failed to roll down as needed. There was no warning light illuminated. The vehicle was taken to a dealer and the contact was informed that the hood latch needed to be replaced. The hood latch was replaced. The window and trunk were not repaired. The manufacturer was not contacted. The failure mileage was 150,000.
The contact owns a 2015 Nissan Altima. The contact stated that while driving at an undisclosed speed, the hood opened abruptly and hit the windshield. The windshield cracked and the hood was damaged. The contact related the failure to NHTSA Campaign Number: 20V315000 (Latches/Locks/Linkages). The vehicle was not diagnosed nor repaired by an independent mechanic or dealer. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 153,126.
Very dim headlights which create issues in less than ideal nighttime conditions.
MY COMPLAINT IS INVOLVING BOTH DRIVERS AND PASSENGER SIDE HEADLIGHTS. WHILE DRIVING FROM THE EVENING ON INTO NIGHT TIME AND WHILE HAVING MY LIGHTS ON I CAN NOT SEE THE LIGHT IN FRONT OF ME THEY ARE VERY,VERY DIM. SO I HAVE TO RESORT ON PUTTING ON MY HIGH BEAMS WHICH CAUSES ONCOMING MOTORISTS TO BE BLINDED BY MY HIGH BEAM LIGHTS WHICH CAN CAUSE THEM TO LOSE CONTROL OF THIER VEHICLE AND CRASH INTO MINE. I ALSO CAN NOT SEE IF THERE IS ANY PEDESTRIAN IN FRONT OF MY VEHICLE OR A DISABLED VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME UNTILL I AM WITHIN A FEW FEET FROM THEM. I CAN NOT FOR SAFETY CONCERNS DRIVE MY VEHICLE AT NIGHT.
Since I bought my 2015 Nissan Altima, the low-beam headlights have been dangerously dim. I stopped driving at night as I almost hit pedestrians. I'm jeopardizing my safety and others on the road. Installing a new headlight did not change visibility and the Nissan dealership inspected the problem and recommended an "Aftermarket" headlight assembly.  There are no warning symptoms or signs of this problem and the vehicle is still equipped with its original headlight housing.
I bought my car brand new in 2015 from a Nissan dealership. Few months after that the breaks started making noise. I took my car to the dealership thinking that I needed new breaks and learned that the breakes were fine and the issue was debris accumulations inside the breaks. Since then I had the same issue a number of times, roughly every 3-5 months depending mileage. Through the years I learned that this was a rather known issue with Nissan Altima 2015. The issue requires opening the breaks, cleaning, and then putting them back. Because this was a known issue, the dealerships fixed my car for free in the past. But last time, I took it to another dealership near my current location and they charged me almost $300 for cleaning the breaks. I'm reporting to see if it would be possible to investigate and find solutions for this recurring issue. I have several recipes dating back to 2015, not sure if they indicate details on the cleaning though.
My vehicle is part of the class action suit for Nissan Altima headlamp assemblies.  I have gone through the proper channels with Nissan.  In the interim I have had a bulb go out. At this point my car is dangerous to drive after dark and I must drive with high beams on.  Nissan will not do anything to help except to say that I am on the list.  I avoid driving after dark as much as possible, but some times it is absolutely necessary.  Nissan is being negligent in this by not offering any solution and not being willing to help with the replacement bulb or trying to expedite the replacement of my headlamp assemblies. If there is an accident due to the state of the headlamps I will take legal action against Nissan.
My transmission has went on my car. I’ve only had my car for 3 years. The car isn’t that old..while driving on the highway my car stopped and would not shift gears.I took my car to Nissan they claimed to fix the problem but my car stopped on me once Again while driving. The dealership fixed sensors in the engine. After the problem was not fixed the said it was my transmission. This is a safety issue and could have caused a accident. Other Nissan drivers are having this same issues..this is happening to multiple Nissans around the country. There should be a recall opened on the transmissions. Why should we the customers hav to pay for faulty transmissions.
The air bags were repaired ( non-accident related ) and now the airbag light has come back on.
Headlights are excessively dim and do not effectively light the roadway. Replacing the bulbs does not remedy the situation.
The passenger air bag light is showing off, cannot get it to reset by the switch or turning the car off.
The contact owns a 2015 Nissan Altima. The contact stated that the transmission seemed as if it was experiencing a failure since the vehicle would jerk while driving with an abnormal odor of coolant burning. The vehicle was not diagnosed nor repaired. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 7,200.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 NISSAN ALTIMA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE AT A COMPLETE STOP, THE VEHICLE INTERMITTENTLY HESITATED TO ACCELERATE WHILE DEPRESSING THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL. THE CONTACT STATED THAT AN UNKNOWN WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED ONCE WHEN THE FAILURE OCCURRED. THE CONTACT ALSO STATED THAT THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WAS DEPRESSED TO THE FLOORBOARD FOR THE VEHICLE TO RESPOND, CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO ACCELERATE AT AN UNSAFE, HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE PLACE OF PURCHASE BUT THE CONTACT WAS THEN REFERRED TO ANOTHER INDEPENDENT MECHANIC FOR ASSISTANCE. THE INDEPENDENT MECHANIC DIAGNOSED THE VEHICLE WITH A DEFECT WITHIN THE TRANSMISSION AND REFERRED THE CONTACT TO AN AUTHORIZED NISSAN DEALER TO ENSURE THAT THE REPAIR WOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. THE CONTACT HAD TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO STATE LINE NISSAN (10401 MADISON AVE, KANSAS CITY, MO 64114) WHERE THEY WERE UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE VEHICLE AND REFUSED TO SERVICE IT UNDER WARRANTY. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 63,148.
IN 2018, WHILE FILLING UP MY GAS, I ACCIDENTALLY PULLED THE HOOD RELEASE LEVER INSTEAD OF MY GAS RELEASE LEVER.  AFTER PULLING AWAY, WHILE DRIVING THE HOOD RELEASED AND FLEW UP TO MY WINDOW, CAUSING DAMAGE ALONG THE HOOD.  SINCE THIS INCIDENT, I HAVE BEEN GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH NISSAN TO GET IT REPAIRED.  THEY INITIALLY DENIED THAT IT WAS THE HOOD LATCH PROBLEM, AS AT THE TIME, MY VIN NUMBER WASN'T INCLUDED IN THE RECALLS (ALTHOUGH WHAT HAPPENED TO ME WAS EXACTLY WHAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE RECALL).  I WAS ABLE TO GET AN APPOINT WITH NISSAN CORP WHO INSPECTED MY CAR AND CLAIMED THAT THE DAMAGE WAS A RESULT OF RUSTING TO THE HOOD LATCH SO THERE WASN'T ANYTHING THEY COULD DO.  NOW THAT MY VIN NUMBER IS INCLUDED IN THE RECALL, I TRIED AGAIN TO GET THE DAMAGE REPAIR/COST COVERED, BUT THEY CONTINUE TO DENY MY REQUEST STATING THE RUST CAUSED IT. (THIS RECALL STATES THAT RUST WILL FORM AND CAUSE THE ACCIDENT)  I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN TO NOW AS NISSAN IS BEING IMPOSSIBLE TO GET HELP FROM.  NOW, EVEN THE HOOD RELEASE LEVER ISN'T WORKING.

I WAS DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY AT THE SPEED OF 50 MPH AND MY HOOD FLEW OPEN. I HAD TO SLAM ON MY BRAKES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY AND TRY AND PULLOVER WITH NO VIEW OUT MY FRONT WINDSHIELD. THERE IS DAMAGE TO MY HOOD AND SURROUNDING AREA DUE TO THIS MISHAP. I AM AFRAID TO EVER OPEN MY HOOD IN CASE IT DOES NOT SHUT PROPERLY AGAIN. I HAD JUST BOUGHT THIS CAR IN NOVEMBER OF 2019. I HAD MY SON IN THE CAR WITH ME AT THE TIME.  *TR
CAR COMPLETELY POWERED OFF WHILE TRAVELING TRAVELING AT 10MPH.  THE ENGINE AND BATTERY SYMBOL APPEARED, CAR WAS ABLE TO COME TO A ROLLING STOP.  PLACED IN PARK AND WAS ABLE TO RESTART WITH NO ISSUES.  TEN MINUTES LATER, CAR IS TRAVELING 60MPH AND CAR POWERED OFF, CONSOLE TURNED BLACK, CAR POWERED ON, POWERED OFF AND THEN POWERED ON WHILE MAINTAINING SAME SPEED.  THIRD TIME OCCURRED 5MIN LATER AS I WAS TRYING TO SAFELY PULL OVER.  WAS TRAVELING UNDER 20MPH AND CAR POWERED OFF , LOCKING BREAKS AND COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP WHILE LOCKING STEERING WHEEL.
THE HEADLIGHTS ON THIS VEHICLE HAVE BEEN REPLACED TWICE. I HAVE HAD THE NISSAN DEALER CHECK THESE HEADLIGHTS AND THEY SAY THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THEM. THE HEADLIGHTS ARE A SEVERE SAFETY HAZARD FOR NIGHT DRIVING. I HAVE TO USE MY BRIGHTS TO BE ABLE TO SEE AT NIGHT. MY GRANDDAUGHTER BORROWED MY CAR AND SHE THOUGHT THE HEADLIGHTS WERE OFF.  THESE HEADLIGHTS NEED A SAFETY RECALL BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED.
SHOWING CODE P0841
THE AIRBAG LIKE HAVE BEEN ON FOR ABOUT 3 WEEKS..THE NISSAN  DEALER  INFORM ME THAT THE AIRBAG COMPONENT ENTIRE SYSTEM IS FAULTY..MY CAR IS A 2015, WITH ONLY 30K MILES ON IT, NEVER BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT,  I DONT DRIVE IT THAT MUCH, JUST GOT IT INSPECTED IN JULY, NOW IN SEPTEMBER IT HAS A FAULTY AIR BAG SYSTEM.  THIS IS NOT NORMAL IN A JUST ABOUT BRAND NEW CAR..PRICE TO REPAIR IS 1600+.  WHEN STARTING THE CAR, THE LIGHT JUST DONT GO OFF, LIKE IT SHOULD
LOW-BEAM HEADLIGHTS BECAME INCREASINGLY DIM OVER SEVERAL MONTHS TO THE POINT WHERE THERE IS NO FORWARD STREET ILLUMINATION. I NOW MUST ALWAYS DRIVE WITH BRIGHT HI-BEAM LIGHTS ON. ON-COMING DRIVERS OFTEN FLASH FOR ME TO DIM/LOWER THE BRIGHTS CAUSING A SAFETY HAZARD FOR BOTH ME AND THE APPROACHING DRIVER. DEALER TECHNICIAN CONFIRMS THAT BULBS ARE FULLY FUNCTIONAL WITH NORMAL DIM BRIGHTNESS AND DO NOT NEED REPLACING. THE ONLY REMEDY SUGGESTED IS FOR BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT HEADLAMP ASSEMBLIES BE REPLACED COSTING OVER $1000 EACH. THIS ON A FOUR YEAR OLD CAR SUGGESTS TO ME THAT THIS IS A MANUFACTURER'S RESPONSIBILITY. A 30 SECOND ON-LINE SEARCH INSTANTLY SHOWS THAT OTHER 2013-2015 NISSAN ALTIMA OWNERS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THEIR CARS.
REAR DRIVER'S DOOR CANNOT OPEN FROM THE INSIDE.  IT MAKE FLY OPEN WHILE CAR IS IN MOTION.    WHILE DRIVING ON EXPRESSWAY, I HAD TO SLAM ON MY BRAKES BECAUSE A CAR JUMP IN MY LANE WITHOUT WARNING; BOTH PASSENGER AND DRIVER SEAT BELTS DID NOT SNATCH BACK.
LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS ARE TOO DIM, I HAVE TO USE HIGH BEAM HEADLIGHTS IN THE DARK ALL THE TIME.
AIR BAG LIGHT WENT ON SO WE TOOK IT IN FOR SERVICE. VEHICLE HAS 60K MILES AND HAS NEVER BEEN INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT. ED MARTIN FISHERS IN NISSAN SAID THAT REPLACING THE DRIVERS SIDE AIRBAG MAY FIX THE ISSUE.  ITS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY AND THE REPLACEMENT IS APPROXIMATELY $1400.  HOW IS THIS NOT A COVERED RECALL OR WARRANTY ISSUE.  IT SHOULD'T BE A WEAR AND TEAR ITEM AND THERE IS NOTHING WE DID TO BREAK THE AIR BAG?
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 NISSAN ALTIMA. WHILE DRIVING 35-65 MPH, AN ABNORMAL NOISE WAS HEARD UNDER THE HOOD. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC AND THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED TO CALL THE MANUFACTURER. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT TAKEN TO A DEALER FOR DIAGNOSTIC TESTING OR REPAIRS. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE AND PROVIDED A CASE NUMBER. THE MANUFACTURER STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT INCLUDED IN MANUFACTURER TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN: 15-102. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 65,000.
THE DRIVERS SIDE SUN VISOR FLOPS DOWN WHEN DRIVING. THE PART IS DEFECTIVE THAT HOLDS IT UP. CREATES A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE IT BLOCKS VISIBILITY. THE PART BROKE AND NISSAN IS REFUSING TO COVER. IN ADDITION THE EXTENDED WARRANTY THAT WAS PURCHASED IS ALSO REFUSING TO COVER THE PART. THIS IS DANGEROUS SINCE THE DRIVERS SIDE VISOR BLOCKS SUN FROM BLINDING ME WHEN DRIVING BUT HAVING IT BLOCKING MY VIEW COMPLETELY CAN CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE WITH THE VISOR. IT IS ALSO IN THE MURANO AND THE PATHFINDER YET THEY ARE CLAIMING THIS IS A WEAR ISSUE THAT SOMEHOW I AM AT FAULT FOR. THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. NISSAN CONTINUES TO KNOWINGLY INSTALL DEFECTIVE PARTS IN THEIR CARS WHICH CAN CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.
2015 ALTIMA HAS INCURRED TWO SEPARATE WATER LEAK ISSUES WITHIN TWO MONTHS. FIRST, DIAGNOSED AS CLOGGED AC DRAIN. THIS REQUIRED COMPLETE REPLACEMENT OF CARPET. THIS WAS REPAIRED UNDER WARRANTY.     SECOND, DIAGNOSED AS FAULTY FIREWALL GROMMET ON STEERING ASSEMBLY. THIS ALLOWED EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF RAINWATER TO FLOOD DRIVER SIDE CARPET AND UNDER DASH ELECTRICAL WHILE DRIVING. NISSAN CLAIMS IS NOT A WARRANTY-ABLE FAILURE DUE TO "NATURE" BEING SOURCE OF WATER WHICH FLOODED THROUGH FIREWALL. DEALER STATES THIS HAS BEEN A COMMON OCCURRENCE ON 2013-2017 ALTIMAS    NISSAN ALSO DOES NOT SEE HOW FAILURE OF FIREWALL GROMMET (S) COULD LEAD TO VEHICLES SINKING FASTER IN THE EVENT OF A WATER CRASH.
DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY, ALL POWER SHUT DOWN TO VEHICLE.  BARELY GOT IT OFF ROADWAY.  WOULD NOT RESTART.  MECHANIC SAID IT NEEDS A NEW FUEL PUMP.
TRANSMISSION REVVING OUT, SLIPPING AND SHUDDERING. VEHICLE IS ONLY 67000 MILES.
TAKATA RECALL
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 NISSAN ALTIMA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE CVT FLUID FLOODED THE TRANSMISSION WITHOUT WARNING. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER (HOWELL MOTORS IN SUMMIT, MS, 601-276-7711), BUT THE FAILURE COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE RECURRED. THE INTERIOR OF THE TRANSMISSION WAS DETERIORATED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 500.
PUSH BUTTON START DOESN'T WORK DUE TO FAULTY STEERING WHEEL LOCK SYSTEM. CAR WILL NOT START UNLESS I USE REMOTE START, OPEN AND CLOSE DOOR THEN HIT BRAKE.
TAKATA RECALL- THE AIRBAG LIGHT COMES ON OCCASIONALLY WHEN AN ADULT IS IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.  I HAVE BEEN IN TWICE.  MY CAR HAS LESS THAN 8,000 MILES.  NOT HAVING A LOT OF FAITH IN THE AIRBAGS RIGHT NOW.  *TR
BACK IN JULY CAR STARTED TO LOSE POWER AND SPUTTER WHILE DRIVING, AND NISSAN REPLACED VALVE BODY. HOWEVER, CAR SHUT OFF WHILE DRIVING ON 09/07 AND I WAS ABLE TO COAST CAR TO CURB. WHEN TRYING TO START AGAIN, ENGINE WOULD ONLY CRANK AND NOT TURN OVER.
ON OR AROUND 6/20/16 I RECEIVED A NHTSA ANS NISSAN NORTH AMERICA, INC RECALL NOTICE REGARDING THE OCCUPANT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (OCS) IN MY VEHICLE. I SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT FOR 6/28/16 WITH NISSAN OF UNION CITY, WHERE I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE. MY VEHICLE WAS SERVICED ON THE AFOREMENTIONED DATE, AND I WAS INFORMED BY NISSAN OF UNION CITY THAT THE RECALL MALFUNCTION WAS CORRECTED. HOWEVER, THAT IS NOT THE TRUTH. THE OCS HAS APPARENTLY BEEN TURNED OFF COMPLETELY, THEREBY CAUSING A SAFETY RISK TO MYSELF AND MY PASSENGERS. WITH THIS FUNCTION TURNED OFF, THE VEHICLE RESTRAINT SYSTEM MAY NOT WORK. I NEED THE SYSTEM TO BE TESTED BECAUSE I HAVE NOT BEEN ASSURED OF THE SAFETY OF THE SYSTEM BY NISSAN OF UNION CITY AFTER THE ISSUE WAS ALLEGEDLY CORRECTED BY THEM. PLEASE INVESTIGATE MY COMPLAINT.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 NISSAN ALTIMA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE AIR BAG WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE SEAT BELT WIRING HARNESS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. IN ADDITION, THERE WAS A FRACTURE BETWEEN THE FIREWALL AND THE INTERIOR OF THE VEHICLE, WHICH ALLOWED WATER TO ENTER THE VEHICLE WHEN IT RAINED. THE CARPET WAS REPLACED, BUT AN ABNORMAL ODOR WAS STILL PRESENT IN THE VEHICLE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURES AND STATED THAT THE VIN WAS NOT INCLUDED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 16V244000 (AIR BAGS). THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 15,000.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 NISSAN ALTIMA. WHILE DRIVING UP AN INCLINE AT 60 MPH, THE VEHICLE LOST POWER AND BEGAN TO ROLL BACKWARDS. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO A DEALER WHO WAS UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE OR REPAIR THE VEHICLE. THE FAILURE RECURRED. IN ADDITION, THE CONTACT NOTICED COROSSION ON THE TRUNK WHERE THE LATCH WAS LOCATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE DEALER WHO WAS UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE FAILURE AND REPAIR THE VEHICLE. THE VIN WAS INCLUDED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 16V029000 (LATCHES/LOCKS/LINKAGES). THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 20,000.
THE PASSENGER AIR BAG SENSOR INTERMITTENTLY DOES NOT SENSE A PASSENGER THEREFORE THE PASSENGER AIR BAG WARNING SYSTEM STAYS OFF. MY WORRY IS, IF IN AN ACCIDENT WILL MY WIFE OF 54 YEARS BE SAVED BY THE AIR BAG DEPLOYING OR NOT.  THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN IN TO FUTURE NISSAN OF ROSEVILLE, ON 03/24/15, INSPECTED, STATED COULD NOT DUPLICATE PROBLEM. WE WERE TOLD NO RECALL OR REPORTS FROM OTHER OWNERS ARE KNOWN. THE PROBLEM IS STILL HAPPENING. WE HAVE HEARD OF THE SAME ISSUE OCCURRING WITH OTHERS. MY WIFE AND I ARE VERY CONCERNED WITH OUR SAFETY.
THE PASSENGER AIR BAG SOMETIME WILL TURN OFF, WHILE PEOPLE STILL SITTING IN THE FRONT SEAT. THE SENSOR OF THE PASSENGER AIR BAG IS JUST NOT SENSITIVE ENOUGH WITH LIGHT WEIGHT ADULT WEIGHT LESS 120LBS.  *TR
The contact owns a 2016 Nissan Altima. The contact stated that while starting the vehicle, the fuel gauge indicated that there was no fuel in the fuel tank. The contact drove to the gas station and refueled; however, the fuel gauge failed to provide the fuel level inside the fuel tank. The check engine warning light was illuminated. The vehicle was taken to an Auto Parts store to have the vehicle diagnosed. The employee retrieved a diagnostic trouble code related to a fuel level sensor failure. The contact was informed that the sensor needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired due to the cost. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 104,000.
Car enters lymph mode, transmission failure car fails to move. Incident occurs randomly while driving on the highway placing driver and passengers at risk of being hit from behind. Nissan transmissions are notorious for transmission failures. This is the second Nissan Altima I have owned with the same transmission problem Vehicle only has approximately 60,000 miles and already failing. No warning lights came on nor other indications of malfunction. Transmission has been serviced by Nissan oil and filter have been changed. Transmission is warranted for 100,000 miles or seven years. The vehicle is a 2016 and has just passed the warranty. Previous Altima transmission was warranted for 100,000 miles regardless of the number of years. This is the third time transmission has fallen into safe mode on the freeway
Going down the highway coming home my hood popped up and blocked my visibility I swerved off the road causing my back tire to blow out. Now my hood will not open back up, since I closed it on the highway. I got my car to my house with the spare but am not sure what to do now. I looked and apparently my car has a recall for a faulty hood and was never taken in for inspection. I believe this was the cause of my hood failure.
Failure in active grill shutter. National issue.
CVT issues. with shudder in speed control and lack of transmission staying engaged seems like it is popping in and out of gear at any speed. lack of power and changes in speed creates safety issues with other drivers on the road.
Based on the air bag warning light showing on my 2016 Nissan Altima I had Lia Nissan of Glens Falls, NY  conduct a diagnostic inspection to determine the cause the noted warning light problem on February 22,2023. The technician determined that the air bag system in the back of the passenger seat was not functioning properly with a related code B0020-13 side a/b ih (open).  To correct this problem, module i/f seat back,  part #87650-phs7a,  needed to be replaced at a cost of $2128. The noted part is the entire back side of the passenger seat where the air bag is housed. They also informed me that unless the needed repair was done, the entire air bag system throughout the car would not function, thus creating a major safety hazard. Upon further investigation, I discovered there is a NHTSA recall, #16V244000 dated 2016-04-25, Air Bag: Sensor: Occupant Classification. This recall notice directly relates to problems with the functioning of the front passenger [OCS]  air bag system. Noting the potential for non-deployment of the frontal air bag and risk of injury. Upon my contacting Nissan USA and the above noted dealer, they claim no recall exists. The above noted NHTSA recall noted does reflect  a clear correlation between my existing air  bag system malfunction and the recall mandate for  Nissan to address. Instead, they simply claim there is no recall on this vehicle, of which, I strongly disagree. In the meantime, all passengers in my vehicle are at risk. Since there have been no accidents or issues that I have created, it appears very clear that this is a safety equipment problem which Nissan is responsible for and has already been directed to address based the NHSTA recall. It would be appreciated if this matter is addressed since no action by Nissan is forthcoming.
My 2016 Altima began loosing power in spurts, wouldn't move after stopping until accelerator was pushed to the floor then it would lunge forward. Took the car to a dealership and found out the transmission needed replaced at 91,000 miles! Nissan did agree to pay half the cost but, here I am 4weeks later and I still don't have my vehicle...No loaner car was provided either, they wanted me to pay $44 a day with 100 free miles. By the time I drove from the dealership to my home I would use 65-70 of those miles alone. Very disappointed in both Nissan and Ricart Automotive!
After some driving specially in hot temperature or after long distances, the engine becomes nonresponsive. Particularly when it comes to a complete stop, there is a delay between pushing the gas pedal and when the car starts to move. The delay can be as long as few seconds.  This problem does not happen all the time but happens quite often in hot weather and long driving.  It is very dangerous. In one occasion I was trying to make a left turn against the coming traffic, I had to make a short break for a pedestrian and then my car did not move and a fast coming traffic almost hit my car as I could not move fast enough due to the transmission delay.   I took it to Nissan dealership last year. They did some minor work and it was fixed for a while but the issue is back again. I took it to Nissan dealership for repair last month but they could not reproduce the error code by just driving around for few minutes. They refused to fix it.  I complained to Nissan and have talked to few representative about the safety issue I have with this car. They refused to take it seriously and they tell me that unless the dealership can produce the error code they can not fix it.   This car is putting the safety of my family and myself in risk and Nissan does not care.  Please let me know what I should do.  Thank you, [XXX]  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).
The head lights are very dim and are melting so they can’t be just replaced. I can not hardly see at night because of this but I don’t hardly drive at night but if I have an emergency I need to be able to see at night. I have two children a baby and a 8 year old. Thank you for your time. Have a wonderful day and please be safe.
For the past two years I have been experiencing dim headlights. I have had them change twice and still cannot see 5 feet ahead of me.  I was unaware that this could be a common problem with this model.  Also, the passenger air light stays on even when no one is sitting in the seat. this problem started about six months ago.  Now I think the transmission maybe starting to slip.
Airbag light is on and Nissan dealership says they may have to replace up to 3 components to find the problem, not covered in warranty

THE VEHICLE SHIFTER ASSEMBLY WILL NOT ALLOW THE VEHICLE TO BE SHIFTED FROM PARK TO REVERSE OR DRIVE. ONCE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING IT OPERATES NORMALLY. IF AN OPERATOR PUTS THE VEHICLE IN PARK, THIS DEFECT IS REPEATED, HOWEVER NOW DRIVERS WILL BE RELUCTANT TO PUT THE VEHICLE IN PARK, THUS RESULTING IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE VEHICLE MAY UNINTENTIONALLY ROLL FORWARD SETTING UP THE POSSIBILITY OF PEDESTRIAN DEATH/INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE RESULTING IN THE VEHICLE ROLLING FORWARD IF THE BRAKE IS NOT CONSTANTLY ENGAGED. I AM SENDING A SCANNED COPY OF AN ALERT FROM NISSAN THAT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF TRANSMISSION DEFECTS, I BELIEVE WHAT I HAVE DESCRIBED ABOVE IS AN EXTENSION OF THAT DEFECT AND THAT THERE IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION BECAUSE OF THAT DEFECT. NISSAN CASE #42195183 SARA JANE @ CONSUMER AFFAIRS 615 725-7587. NHTSA ODI #11365560 REF #342354. I FILED THE INITIAL REQUEST FOR INVESTIGATION WITH DARLEEN @ NHTSA ON 10/21/20 @ 1015 HRS.

SHAKING, AUTOMATIC SLOWING SPEED, PICK UP TAKES TIME, ENGINE LIGHT ON  DEALER SAID TRANSMISSION ISSUE COST 4850 PLUS TAX. THIS IS NISSAN ALTIMA 2016 ONLY 71000. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY KILLING CONSUMER FINANCE. NEVER EVER NISSAN AGAIN.
ACCELERATING ONTO THE HIGHWAY ON YESTERDAY MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CANE ON AS WELL AND MY TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT WHICH CAUSED MY CAR TO LOSE POWER. I WAS ABLE TO GET RIGHT BACK OFF THE FREEWAY AND TURN INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD. WHEN I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND BACK ON IT STARTED WITH THE SAME LIGHTS ON. I HAD MY TRANSMISSION REBUILT AT 73,000 MILES WITH A 12,000 MILE WARRANTY ALREADY BUT I DON'T THINK THAT MY TRANSMISSION IS THE ISSUE THIS TIME. I HAD TO GET MY CAR TOWED TO THE NISSAN OF GRAPEVINE DEALERSHIP AGAIN BECAUSE I REFUSE TO DRIVE THE CAR WITH MY 3 MONTH OLD AND SIXTEEN YEAR OLD IN THE CAR
ON THE 14TH OF JUNE, 2019 I WAS DRIVING TO WORK. WHEN SUDDENLY I FELT MY CAR POWER DECREASING AS I PRESSED THE GAS. SOON AS THAT HAPPEN I NEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG SO FOR MY SAFETY AND OTHER I TOOK THE NEAREST EXITED TO LOCAL STREET AND FOUND A SAFE AREA TO CHECK MY CAR. TURN IT OFF AND BACK ON AND I STARTED DRIVING SGAIN IT SEEMED LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED BUT AFTER ABOUT 10 LATER IT COMPLETELY LOST POWER NO MATTER HOW HARD I PRESSED THE GAS. SO I CALLED A TOW TRUCK AND WE TOOK TO THE REPAIR SHOP AND I FOUND OUT THAT THE TRANSMISSION ON MY CAR HAS DIED AND IT WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED. AND THAT WILL COST ME ALOT OF MONEY. SO I CALLED A NISSAN DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME IT WILL. COST ME $3000 FOR NEW TRANSMISSION. SO MY NEXT OPTION WAS TO CHECK WITH NISSAN IF THEY WILL HELP ME SO I CALLED THE NISSAN CUSTOMER SERVICE SO THEY ASKED HOW MUCH MILES I HAD IN THE CAR AND I TOLD THEM 70,000 MILES. BUT SADLY THEY TOLD ME MY WARRANT END AT 60,000 MILES. I NEED MY CAR FOR WORK SO AT THE END IT TOOK ABOUT A WEEK TO GET IT FIXED AND COSTED ME AROUND $2000. WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH WITH THIS CAR. WHAT SURPRISED ME IS THAT I ALWAYS TOOK GOOD CARE OF IT SINCE THE FIRST TIME I GOT IT I MADE SURE ALL MAINTENANCE THAT WAS NEEDED FOR IT WAS DONE BUT I WAS SURPRISED THAT MY TRANSMISSION DIED AT ONLY 70,000 MILES. SO HOPEFULLY THIS HELP IN ANYWAY FOR OTHER WHO HAVE THE SAME ISSUE.
WHEN I AM STOPPED (AT A STOP SIGN, TRAFFIC LIGHT, ETC.) THE CAR HESITATES TO ACCELERATE WHEN I PRESS THE GAS.  IT SOMETIMES TAKES 5 TO 7 SECONDS BEFORE THE CAR WILL BEGIN TO ACCELERATE.  THIS HAPPENS RANDOMLY, AND THERE IS NO WARNING.  THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES WHEN THE RPMS REV UP EXTREMELY HIGH AND THE CAR FEELS LIKE IT IS STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN SPEED. I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP, AND SINCE THEY CAN'T REPRODUCE THE ISSUE, AND NOTHING SHOWS UP WHEN THEY RUN DIAGNOSTICS, THEY HAVE STATED THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.  I PURCHASED MY CAR BRAND NEW AND CURRENTLY IT HAS 46,000 MILES, AND I CURRENTLY DON'T FEEL SAFE WHEN DRIVING IT. THIS HAS BEEN RANDOMLY HAPPENING FOR MONTHS.
I HAVE A 2016 NISSAN ALTIMA WITH ABOUT 68,000 MILES AND MY TRANSMISSION HAS TROUBLE CHANGING GEARS AFTER DRIVING IT FOR A FEW MINUTES. AS I CHANGE GEARS FROM 0 TO 40 MPH, THE CAR STARTS JERKING OR TAKES A WHILE TO REACH 40 MPH. IT ALSO HAPPENS WHEN I'M DRIVING AROUND THE CITY AND I MAKE A FULL STOP AT A STOP LIGHT. AFTER THE LIGHT TURNS GREEN, WHEN I START ACCELERATING THE CAR WON'T SPEED UP NO MATTER HOW FAR I PUSH THE ACCELERATOR, AFTER 6-10 SECONDS HAVE PASSED IT'LL START MOVING BUT IN A VERY JERKING MANNER. TO FIX THE ISSUE AT THE MOMENT, I HAVE TO TURN OFF THE CAR AND LET IT REST FOR A FEW MINUTES. BUT, IT STILL DOES THIS EVERY TIME I DRIVE. IN THE HIGHWAY, I CAN NOT GO FASTER THAN 70 MPH BECAUSE ONCE I GET OUT OF THE HIGH WAY AND SLOW DOWN THE CAR WILL HAVE THE SAME GEAR CHANGING ISSUE AND IT FEELS LIKE THE CAR WILL GIVE UP ANY SECOND. THIS WASN'T AN ISSUE WHEN I GOT THIS CAR WITH ABOUT 48,000 MILES ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO. IT STARTED ABOUT 8 MONTHS AFTER GETTING IT AND  IT HAS ONLY GOTTEN WORSE. I TOOK MY CAR TO MY MECHANIC TO LET ME KNOW WHAT THE ISSUE WAS AND HE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS THE CVT TRANSMISSION. SINCE MY CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY AND IT DOESN'T FALL UNDER THE RECALL MADE FOR THE CVT TRANSMISSION, MY ONLY SOLUTION WOULD BE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET.
2016 NISSAN ALTIMA 2.5SR CVT TRANSMISSION FAILURE AT 26K MILES. WHILE IN MOTION GOING FREEWAY SPEEDS, VEHICLE SUDDENLY LOSES POWER WHEN ATTEMPTING TO MAINTAIN CRUISING SPEED AND RPMS FLUCTUATED INTENSELY UP AND DOWN. FELT VERY UNSAFE WHILE TRYING TO PULL OVER TO THE SHOULDER AND FEARED OTHER VEHICLES COULD HAVE STRUCK ME WHILE HAVING NO CONTROL OVER VEHICLE SPEED. BROUGHT VEHICLE INTO NISSAN DEALERSHIP AND CONFIRMED IT IS AN ISSUE WITH CVT TRANSMISSION REQUIRING $4K CVT TRANSMISSION REPAIR, LUCKILY COVERED UNDER 5 YEAR, 60K MILE WARRANTY. THIS ISSUE SEEMS COMMON WITH OTHER OWNERS OF THE CVT TRANSMISSION AND SHOULD HAVE ITS POWERTRAIN CVT TRANSMISSION WARRANTY EXTENDED ON NEWER MODELS TO 10 YEARS, 120,000 MILES JUST LIKE THE 2003-2010 YEAR MODELS WITH THE CVT HAVE RECEIVED.
2016 ALTIMA, BARELY 3 YEARS OLD, 71,000 MILES.  ABOUT A WEEK AGO, THE CAR BEGAN TO JERK AND SHUDDER AND RPM'S JUMP UP AND DOWN WHEN I ACCELERATE FROM A STOP.  BEFORE THE DAY WAS OVER, IT WAS HAPPENING WHILE I WAS DRIVING (ANY WHERE FROM 0-60+MPH).  THEN CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  WHEN I HIT THE GAS, IT MAY JERK/LURCH FORWARD OR MAY NOT GO ANYWHERE.  I WOULD HAVE TO LET OFF THE GAS AND TRY AGAIN.  SOME TIMES IT WOULD CORRECT ITSELF, OTHER TIMES NOT AND RPM'S WOULD STAY HIGH-- 3-5. FELT LIKE IT DIDN'T WANT TO "CHANGE GEARS" (ITS A CVT SO ONLY ONE "GEAR") WHILE JERKING AND ACCELERATING/DECELERATING.  VERY DISTRACTING AND CONCERNING TO SAY THE LEAST.  TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP TODAY TO HAVE THE DIAGNOSTICS RAN.  WAS CONTACTED AND TOLD IT WAS THROWING 2 CODES - SUB ASSEMBLY FAILURE AND PRESSURE FLUID SENSOR FAILURE.  THESE ARE TRANSMISSION CODES.  WAS TOLD I NEEDED A NEW TRANSMISSION, $4200 OUT THE DOOR..... IN WHAT WORLD IS IT "NORMAL" FOR A FAIRLY NEW CAR WITH NO PRIOR ISSUES TO HAVE A COMPLETE TRANSMISSION FAILURE??  THE DEALER AGREED THERE IS NOTHING WE COULD'VE DONE TO PREVENT THIS.  I HAVE CONTACTED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND FILED A COMPLAINT, REQUESTING GOODWILL ASSISTANCE WITH THE REPAIR COSTS.  I WAS TOLD SOMEONE WOULD GET BACK TO ME BY CLOSE OF BUSINESS TOMORROW.  THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSION.  READING THESE COMMENTS, IT APPEARS THAT THE REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSIONS DO NOT PERFORM MUCH BETTER.  I WILL BE GETTING OUT OF THIS CAR ASAP.
I PURCHASED THIS CAR IN DECEMBER 2017; HOWEVER, IN SEPTEMBER OF 2018 THE MALFUNCTION LIGHT CAME ON. I HAD THE CAR DIAGNOSED BY AUTOZONE FIRST WHICH ADVISED IT WAS A TRANSMISSION PRESSURE FLUID SENSOR. I THEN FOLLOWED UP WITH THE NISSAN DEALER, BOMMARITO ON 661 DUNN RD IN HAZELWOOD, MO. 63042 TO FIND OUT PART OF THE TRANSMISSION NEEDS TO BE BUILT, CODE P17F0. THE CAR WILL NOT ACCELERATE OVER 35-40 MPH, AND THE RPMS ARE JUMPING ALL OVER. THE ESTIMATE OF REPAIR IS 4600.00 THIS CAR HAS APPROXIMATELY 66,500  MILES ON IT AND I BOUGHT IT WITH APPROXIMATELY 49,000. THIS APPEARS TO BE A FAULTY TRANSMISSION, AS I HAVE HAD CARS WELL OVER 120, 000 MILES AND NO TRANSMISSION ISSUES. THERE IS ONE MORE PERSON I AM AWARE OF WHO HAD THE SAME ISSUE ON A 2016 NISSAN ALTIMA.
FIRST THE ENGINE USES POWER WHILE GOING DOWN THE HIGHWAY,NOW GOING DOWN THE HIGHWAY DOING 70 MILES A HOUR LET OFF GAS PETAL TO SLOW SPEED DOES NOT CHANGE. THIS CAR IS A LEMON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  UNSAFE TO DRIVE,DEALER IS NO HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I HAVE BEEN HAVING CHRONIC ISSUES WITH ENGINE ON MY 2016 NISSAN ALTIMA. INITIALLY (11/2016), THE CAR WOULD "JUMP/SKIP" WHEN I WOULD TRY TO ACCELERATOR AND EVEN FEELING LIKE IT WAS GOING TO CUT OFF ON ME. WHEN I CALLED I WAS INFORMED IT WAS DUE TO DEFECT AND IT WAS ON RECALL. THE ISSUES APPEARED TO RESOLVE UNTIL 11/2017 I STARTED EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUE BUT WORSE AND WAS NOT ABLE TO ACCELERATE WHILE I WAS DRIVING TO WORK AND BACK HOME. THIS OCCURRED ON FLORIDA TURNKPIKE AND LOCAL HIGHWAYS. CARS WERE HOOKING AT ME BECAUSE I WAS NOT ABLE TO PROCEED WHEN LIGHT TURNED GREEN, EVEN THOUGH I WAS FLOORING THE CAR PEDAL. WHEN I TOOK THE CAR TO THE SHOP, I WAS INFORMED IT WAS MY TRANSMISSION AND THEY HAD TO REBUILD IT. AFTERWARDS, I CONTINUE TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR CUTTING OFF ON ME AND ACCELERATION ISSUES. I BROUGHT IT BACK, AND I WAS TOLD IT WAS THE CRANK SENSOR. THEY REPLACED IT BUT KNOW THE ENGINE CONTINUE TO SOUND LIKE IT IS WORKING OVERTIME TO PERFORM AND MAKE A CONSTANT HIGH PITCH SOUND. I AM BRING IT BACK TO THEM A 3RD TIME TO INVESTIGATE.
THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED IN 11 NOV OF 2016,  THE DAY OF PURCHASE THE LEFT PASSENGER WINDOW WOULD NOT GO DOWN. THE NEW CAR WAS LEFT AT THE DEALER THE DAY OF PURCHASE FOR REPAIRS.  THREE PLUS WEEKS LATER, AROUND 12/03/2016 I HAD TO CALL TO FIND OUT IF THE CAR HAD BEEN FIXED.  NO COMMUNICATION FROM THE DEALER.  THE CAR WAS PICKED UP AND USED AFTER REPAIRS.  03/MARCH 2017 WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD MY 11 YEAR OLD SON ROLLED THE LEFT PASSENGER WINDOW DOWN AND THE DOOR CAME OPEN WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY. I RESEARCHED THE RECALLS AND THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THE RIGHT DOOR ONLY.  RESEARCH NISSAN HAD NOT SENT TO THE DEALERSHIPS.(RECALL NUMBER, 17V-040, RECALL DATE 01/18/2017) NO NOTICE OF RECALL WAS EVER SENT TO ME NOR WAS THE DEALERSHIP AWARE OF THE RECALL.  THE COPY I TOOK A COPY TO THEM WAS THEIR FIRST NOTICE OF A RECALL. I RECEIVED THE RECALL ON 3/16/2017I TRIED TO WORK THE BUYBACK PROCESS WITH NISSAN BUT THEY STATED THAT THERE WAS A RECALL IN PLACE AND THEY WOULD NOT ENTERTAIN A BUYBACK.  NO I'M STUCK WITH A VEHICLE I DO NOT TRUST AND
The contact owns a 2017 Nissan Altima. The contact stated that while driving approximately 50 MPH, the overhead console dislodged from the ceiling and fell downward, striking the driver on the head. No injuries were reported. The vehicle was taken to the local mechanic, who determined that the clips attaching the console to the interior ceiling of the vehicle had failed, causing the console to detach and fall. The contact was informed that the console needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not yet repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure, but no assistance was provided. The local dealer was not contacted regarding the failure. The failure mileage was 64,300.
When I push the start button my car sometimes won't start and it won't go in drive. There has not been any warning lamps, messages or symptoms of the problem prior to the failure. It started about 2 weeks ago, it doesn't always happen, but it's happening more frequently now. I had an emergency yesterday and I couldn't get my car started.  After waiting about 10 minutes I was able to get it started, but I was afraid if I turned the car off it wouldn't start again. The problem has not been inspected by the dealership or confirmed  by an independent service center.  I'm interested in seeing if there has been a recall for this problem
Engine control unit failure
Last week, the air bag warning light came on in my 2017 Nissan Altima - the very same day as the recall was published about the recall on older Nissans - but my vin was not among those recalled - I called the dealership and was told it would have to be replaced at my cost - I have done nothing to cause this problem and do not feel I should be responsible for repairs concerning this matter - I regularing service my car and this is not among the items that require regular servicing .
My airbag malfunction light came on randomly. Never have I been involved in an accident. I have only had this vehicle for 2 years.  I took it to Nissan dealership in Chandler AZ to have it inspected. They told me the recalls for Nissan Altimas only go up to 2016, mine is a 2017. This puts me, my passenger and my children at risk and it is not safe to drive. I have a teenager that was trying to learn how to drive with his permit and now due to this issue, it is not safe for him to do so. If there were recalls prior to the 2017 Nissan Altimas, obviously the 2017s are affected as well. Someone needs to address this issue asap.
My nissan altime 2017 has 35000 miles on it. My car has never been into any accident. The Airbag warning light was on June 2023 and I sent it to the Cost Mesa/CA dealer to check (if there was no issue identified, they would still charge $200 for examination; but if anything need to be fixed/replaced, the $200 would go to part of the repair fee). They reported that the battery was low and caused the issue. They replaced the battery ($280) and reset the warning light. But now, one week later, the airbag warning light is on again and I will sent it to the dealer to check again. Nissan should check/recall their 2017 Alitma airbag system given some many filed reports. It is hard to not relate this airbag problem with the airbag recall on previous 2013-2016 Altima models.
The contact owns a 2017 Nissan Altima. The contact stated while driving at various speeds, the air bag warning light illuminated. The vehicle was taken to the local dealer where the warning light was reset; however, the failure reoccurred. The vehicle was taken back to the dealer, where the diagnostic codes were cleared, and the vehicle was test driven; however, the failure persisted. A Nissan warranty inspector recommended the replacement of the front driver's side air bag module, the driver's air bag and the air bag sensor. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and informed the contact that the vehicle could not be repaired under the warranty unless the driver's side air bag module completely failed. The failure mileage was approximately 29,000.
Follow-up to issue #11479380  Just 6 days ago, I filed a complaint regarding acceleration issues with my 2017 Nissan Altima.  Unfortunately, yesterday (8/20/2022), I was involved in an accident with the car as a direct result of these ongoing acceleration issues.  I was the driver in the driveway of a friend’s house and as I tried to pull closer to the house (to perform a K-turn in a tight spot), with my foot (lightly) on the gas pedal, the car suddenly surged forward and hit the house.  A passenger and I both experienced minor injuries (no medical attention required), and both the car and the house now require repairs.  I’m in touch with both my insurance and Nissan about this accident, but no longer feel safe driving this vehicle (which is now pending repairs due to this accident).  I  wanted to post a follow-up since there was an accident directly related to this issue.
The armbar connected to the front driver's side tire locked up during a left turn and then disconnected from the tire.  I had no control over the steering and the car was still moving.  I had two choices, run into the curb to stop the car or go over into a ditch about 30 feet down.  When I ran into the curb it busted the tire and damaged my front bumper.  I could've been seriously injured, injured someone else, died, or killed someone because I had no control over the steering. This is very dangerous and I have seen a few other people report similar instances like mine.  the vehicle is currently at the Ancia Nissan in San Antonio and waiting for my insurance company to look at it.  The mechanic said it may be totaled but he wasn't sure.  There was no warning signs or anything.  I am going to get to the bottom of this our lives were put in danger and I don't want this to happen to anyone else.
The contact owns a 2017 Nissan Altima. The contact received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 20V315000 (Latches/Locks/Linkages). The contact called the local dealer, but they failed to respond. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The contact stated that the manufacturer had exceeded a reasonable amount of time for the recall repair. The manufacturer was not notified of the issue. The contact had not experienced a failure. Parts distribution disconnect.
I HAVE A 2017 NISSAN ALTIMA SV, 4CYL, 2.5L... I AM HAVING WORSENING PROBLEMS WITH ACCELERATION. WHEN ATTEMPTING TO PULL OFF FROM A RED LIGHT FOR EXAMPLE, IT WILL HESITATE FOR ABOUT 4,5 SECONDS,  RPMS INCREASE THEN A SURGE OF ACCELERATION. ALSO,  WHILE DRIVING IT WILL LOSE SPEED WITH MY FOOT ON THE GAS, EVEN WITH THE RPMS UP AS IF IT WERE MOVING FASTER.. THANKFULLY THE DRIVERS BEHIND ME WERE ATTENTIVE OR IT COULD HAVE CAUSED ME AND OTHERS A GREAT DEAL OF DAMAGE, LIKE WHEN I WAS TRYING TO ACCELERATE FROM A CROSS STREET TURN LANE. IT WAS SPORADIC AT FIRST; I WENT TO VALVOLINE AND GOT REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION FLUID, AND THE GUY TURNED OFF THE ENGINE LIGHT. IT STARTED UP AGAIN A FEW WEEKS LATER, AND I GOT A NEW AIR FILTER AND WENT BACK FOR A FUEL SYSTEM CLEANING. ANOTHER GUY RESET THE ENGINE LIGHT AGAIN, AND NOW(ABOUT 3 WEEKS LATER)IT'S BACK WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. SOMETIMES, I'D PULL OVER AND TURN OFF THE CAR AND IT HELPED A BIT. NOW(YESTERDAY) THAT ISN'T HELPING AND THE SLOW ACCELERATION AND SPEED HAPPENS EVERY TIME. I USED THE DIAGNOSING TOOL AT AUTO ZONE WHICH READ, "P0776-PRESSURE CONTROL SOLENOID B PERFORMANCE OR STUCK OFF". I AM SEEING THAT THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE EXACT SAME THING, AND EVEN A RECALL ON THE MODELS UP TO 2016 REGARDING THIS, BUT 2017 AND AFTER SEEM TO BE GETTING IGNORED.
WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEED (75MPH), MY RPM'S SHOT UP.  I LET OFF THE ACCELERATOR BRIEFLY AND WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO PUSH THE ACCELERATOR AGAIN, NOTHING HAPPENED.  MY CAR CONTINUED TO SLOW DOWN AND I WAS ALMOST HIT FROM BEHIND.  I WAS ABLE TO PULL OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY.  I HAD MY CAR TOWED TO A GARAGE AND THEY SAID THE CAR HAD 4 ERROR CODES, ALL HAVING TO DO WITH THE TRANSMISSION.  I HAVE HAD MY CAR TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP AS I AM STILL COVERED UNDER MY 5 YEAR/ 60000 MILE WARRANTY.
TRANSMISSION TENDS TO JUMP WHEN ACCELERATING AND CAR JERKS EVEN WHEN PRESSING ON THE GAS GRADUALLY. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WILL THEN FLICKER ON AND OFF BUT DOESN'T STAY ON LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO MAKE IT TO THE SHOP.
THE SOLENOID IN THE TRANSMISSION RESPONSIBLE FOR SHIFTING WENT BAD AT 67,000 MILES AND THE VALVE BODY HAD TO BE REPLACED IN THE TRANSMISSION.    I WAS DRIVING AND WHEN IT WAS NEEDING TO MAINTAIN THE SPEED WITHOUT GAS OR BRAKE APPLIED IT WOULD JUMP BETWEEN GEARS WITHOUT REASON AND FELT LIKE A SHUDDER AS I WAS DRIVING IT.  *TR
VEHICLE FIRE STARTED FROM PASSENGER SIDE UNDER HOOD WHILE TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 55 MPH ON BATTLEFIELD PARKWAY IN RINGGOLD, GA.  CAR HAD 50,000 MILES.  PULLED OVER AND GOT OUT TO CALL 911, CAR GOT ENGULFED IN FLAMES AND IS A TOTAL LOSS.  CATOOSA COUNTY SHERIFF AND CATOOSA COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED.
MY CAR ALWAYS QUIT OFF WHILE I AM DRIVING FOR WHATEVER REASON. I WAS DROPPING MY KIDS OFF AT SCHOOL ONE DAY IN TRAFFIC AND IT CUT OFF ON ME AND IT ALSO CUT OFF ON ME ON THE RAILROAD TRACKS, THERE WASN'T A TRAIN INSIGHT THANK GOD.... THIS  IS VERY DANGEROUS AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS...
TRANSMISSION FAILED ON INTERSTATE AT APPROXIMATELY 70MPH. I WAS TOLD BY THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP GARAGE MANAGER THAT THEY REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY THEY FAIL EXCEPT THAT THEY THINK THE TRANSMISSION OVERHEATS DUE TO UNDERSIZED PUMP AND MESH NOT ALLOWING ENOUGH CIRCULATION. EVERYTHING WAS REPLACED AT NISSAN'S EXPENSE, HOWEVER I HAVE NO CONFIDENCE IN THE REPAIR. WHEN THIS HAPPENED THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE WARNING LIGHT OR MESSAGE THAT APPEARED ON THE DASH.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNED A 2017 NISSAN ALTIMA. WHILE DRIVING AT AN UNKNOWN SPEED, THE VEHICLE DRIFTED INDEPENDENTLY OFF A CLIFF AND CRASHED.

I want formally lodge a complaint regarding a serious issue with a 2018 Nissan Altima that I purchased from a Nissan dealership on [XXX]. The vehicle, which had 107,000 miles at the time of purchase, has exhibited a critical failure.  On [XXX], while I was accelerating to change lanes in rush hour traffic, the car began jerking and suddenly slowed down. This malfunction nearly resulted in a dangerous collision with an 18-wheeler and caused me to be run off the road. This incident could have been catastrophic, and it deeply concerns me, especially since this vehicle was intended for my daughter's commute to and from school.  Following this, I had the car towed to the Nissan dealership and was informed that it requires a new transmission. I am shocked to learn that the cost to replace the transmission is $6,200. This is particularly distressing given that I purchased the car less than four months ago and was unaware of the known issues with the CVT transmission.  It is unacceptable that vehicles with faulty transmissions are still being sold without adequate warning or extended warranties. Nissan should be required to provide clear disclaimers about potential transmission issues before a sale. The lack of transparency and the high cost of repairs are deeply troubling.  Given the severity of this situation and the potential risks involved, I believe that Nissan should take immediate action to address these concerns. The warranty should be extended, and there should be clear warnings provided to potential buyers about the risks associated with the transmission.  The current lack of empathy and action from Nissan is disappointing and unacceptable. I urge you to review this situation promptly and provide a satisfactory resolution.

I bought my car in February 2021 and me not knowing anything about vehicles I first heard the popping noise when I backed my car out of the driveway.I thought it was something to do with the steering wheel. I recently had someone to look at the car and they said it was my front axles going bad, this could be a safety issue. I have to work with mentally challenged people and I have to transport them back-and-forth to doctors appointments. Is there anyway that there could be a recall on those axles because I know someone else who has an  Altima just like mine and hers does the same thing . It’s very embarrassing to hear that popping noise and I’m afraid that my car will break down because of it and my front crash light stays on constantly. Please help me resolve this issue. I’ve been dealing with it since I bought the car..
2018 Nissan Altima and Sentra cars have faulty continuously variable transmissions (CVTs) that cause juddering, shuddering, clunking, jerking and acceleration problems.  This happen while driving on the highway at a speed of 75 mph.  This caused me swerve and almost rear ended by another car.

AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BREAKING TURNS OFF CONSTANTLY.   WHEN A TRUCK TOWING A TRAILER PASSED ME A LIGHT CAME ON AND A MESSAGE FLASHED ON THE DASH. IT SAID THAT THE RADAR WAS UNAVAILABLE BECAUSE OF AN OBSTRUCTION. IT HAPPENED AGAIN AT AN INTERSECTION. IT SEEMS TO GO OFF SEVERAL TIMES A DAY WHEN IT SENSES CARS BESIDE ME, AT INTERSECTIONS, TURNING... I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH NISSAN SERVICE AT JEFF WYLER KONG?S NISSAN IN MASON OHIO. THEY FOUND DTC # C1A16 RADAR STAIN AND C1B55-97 RADAR BLOCKAGE. THEY REPROGRAMMED THE RADAR UNIT. IT STILL DIDN?T WORK. THEY SAID THE PART NEEDS TO BE REPLACED TO THE TUNE OF $1637.86. WE BOUGHT THIS CAR SPECIFICALLY FOR THE AEB. WE RESEARCHED IT?S RELIABILITY THROUGH CONSUMER REPORTS. I CHECKED AND THERE WERE NO RECALLS. THERE WERE NO ACCIDENTS ON THE VEHICLE?S HISTORY REPORT.

FRONT CRASH CAMERA.  IT GOES OFF FOR NO REASON.  IF I'M DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY & IT JUST GOES OFF, IF I'M GOING ON A FLYOVER RAMP IT PICKS UP THE CTB (CONCRETE TRAFFIC BARRIER) & GOES OFF AGAIN.  IT  DON'T MATTER WHERE OR WHAT IT JUST GOES OFF.
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN CONTINUOUSLY HAPPENING SINCE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE WITH ABOUT 2500 MILES ON IT, IT CURRENTLY HAS ABOUT 6500 MILES ON IT. THE EMERGENCY BRAKING SYSTEM CONTINUES TO TURN ON AND OFF AT VARIOUS TIMES BUT HAS CONTINUED TO GET WORSE OVER THE FEW MONTHS THAT I HAVE OWNED IT. THE WORST SITUATION I HAVE HAD WAS RECENTLY ON A 300 MILE ROUND TRIP WHEN THE EMERGENCY BRAKING WOULD ACTIVATE AND DEACTIVATE EVERY FEW MINUTES, IN WHICH IT WOULD FLASH ON THE DASH SAYING THE SYSTEM WAS OBSTRUCTED, AND THE WARNING LIGHT SHOWING IT DEACTIVATED WOULD TURN ON, THE CRUISE CONTROL WOULD SHUT OFF AND A KEEPING SOUND WOULD TURN ON. THIS WAS HAPPENING WITH NO APPARENT PARTICULAR INCIDENT. THE TRIP TOOK SOME BACK ROADS, A LOT OF HIGHWAY (2 LANE AND 4 LANE) AND A MODERATE IN CITY DRIVING. THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR, THE SUN WAS OUT WITH PARTIAL CLOUDING, IT WAS AROUND 40 DEGREES OUTSIDE, THE ROADS WERE DRY, SOME WERE ROUGH SOME SMOOTH, OTHER THAN IN THE CITY THERE WAS LITTLE STOP AND GO TRAFFIC. THE WORST INCIDENT WAS DURING THE RETURN TRIP, WE WERE ON A 2 LANE HIGHWAY THAT WAS PRETTY SMOOTH. THERE WAS NO ONE IN FRONT OF US WE WERE DOING APPROXIMATELY 70MPH WITH TRAFFIC BEHIND US, WE HAD THE CRUISE CONTROL ON AND WERE JUST GOING ALONG A STRAIGHT FLAT STRETCH OF ROAD WHEN THE SYSTEM ONCE AGAIN DEACTIVATED, BEEPED THEN REACTIVATED AND BEEPED AND THEN SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES ON US. IT WAS ONLY AN INSTANT AND CREATED NO SITUATION OF DANGER BASED ON OUR POSITION, AND AS IT WAS INSTANT I WAS ABLE TO STEP ON THE GAS AGAIN AND WE ONLY DROPPED FROM 70 TO ABOUT 50MPH IN THE PERIOD. THIS WAS THE WORST SITUATION I HAVE RUN INTO WITH THE ISSUE SO I LOOKED IT UP ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND IT IS STATED AS AN ISSUE ON THE SENTRA. THIS UNEXPECTED DECELERATION ON A FREEWAY COULD HAVE BEEN A DEVASTATING ACCIDENT.

The forward emergency braking system on my vehicle disables itself. I receive a message stating "front laser obstructed". There is no obstruction on vehicle. I relly on the emergency braking system to give me a heads up on possible forwars collision. Problem started around 50000 miles. It went away for a few months then came back
All 4 door actuators have gone out. I cannot lock or unlock my car with the key fob or manually with the key from the outside. The driver side door is unable to be manually locked/unlocked causing me to get locked in and out of my car randomly. Within the last month, it has gotten more frequent with the driver said. The rear doors went bad months ago. The passenger door started approximately 2 months ago and the driver door within the last month.   This was confirmed by Modern Nissan in Winston Salem, NC on 06/10/2023 and I got a second opinion on 06/16/2023 who also confirmed all 4 door actuators needed to be replaced.   There were no warning lights or messages.
Its not unknown.  I arrived at work on Thursday the 12th of May, AT 8:00 A.M.  I work in an Industrial Park where there is no traffic.  My car was looking great, I put my sunshade cover up and proceeded to go into work.  After working all day I came out to my car and my windshield was crack starting from the top of the car and flowering down.  Nothing hit my car on my way into work, and actually there is nothing that shows it was hit a all.  This is a factory defect and there are bubbles when the glue or whatever they use is a mess.
I LEASED A 2020 NISSAN ALTIMA SL IN JANUARY. 2020.  I'VE BEEN IN ISOLATION FOR 13 MONTHS BECAUSE OF A HIGH RISK OF CONTRACTING COVID19. I TURNED ON MY CAR PERIODICALLY AND SAW AN ALERT ON THE DASHBOARD.I CALLED THE MANAGER OF CONTINENTAL NISSAN WHERE I LEASED THE CAR. HE TOLD ME IT HAD TO DO WITH THE REAR SENSORS AND ADVISED ME TO WIPE THEM, WHICH I DID. HOWEVER, WHEN I BACKED UP MY CAR TODAY THE REAR SENSORS DID NOT GO OFF WHEN I GOT VERY CLOSE TO MY NEIGHBOR'S GARAGE DOOR. I HAVE A CASE #43362334. THE NISSAN REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME THAT I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY REPAIRS TO THE REAR SENSORS, WHICH IS PREPOSTEROUS. I DID NOT DRIVE THE VEHICLE FOR OVER A YEAR.MOREOVER, THERE ARE RECALLS ON 2020/2021 ALTIMAS. NISSAN IS PUTTING ME AT DANGER OF A REAR END COLLISION/DAMAGE.
MY FATHER IS CURRENTLY DRIVING ONE FROM ENTERPRISE WE DON'T KNOW IF THE GLASS HAD A HAIRLINE CRACK PREVIOUSLY EXISTING OR IF THE CAR WINDOW GOT VANDALIZED  BUT THE WHOLE WINDOW IS GONE AND THE ALARM SYSTEM DIDN'T EVEN GO OFF ETHER. I THINK THE HEAT HIT IT AND MADE THE WINDOW EXPLODE GLASS FROM THE WINDOW WENT EVERYWHERE THE CAR ONLY HAD 27,866 WHENEVER WE GOT IT FROM THE RENTAL CAR PLACE MONDAY I FEEL LIKE NISSAN NEEDS TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS INCIDENT MYSELF AND MY FATHER BOTH TOLD ENTERPRISE ON BLACKSTOCK RD WE FELT LIKE THE CAR HAD A DEFECT.
Purchased the car in June of 2024 with around 33,000 miles. I thought the doors were locked and someone was able to just open my back door when my car was unattended in a store parking lot;  the car was supposed to be locked. Lights and horn started going off. Being a female with a child this is a very scary issue. The idea that anyone can get in when you think the doors are locked or vice versa, in the event of an emergency no one can get in because the doors dont unlock. It started with the passenger side rear door lock not working with fob or button. The lock needs to be done manually. The dealership looked at it and said they could not replicate the problem and everything was working. Now both rear door locks dont work with the buttons or the key fob. The rear doors have to be locked and unlocked manually all the time. Car is currently at the dealership and they confirmed the issue and are telling me that the BCM (i believe is what they said) needs to be replaced and reprogrammed. The car only has approx. 42,500 miles.  The other issue with the car is the automatic emergency braking system light comes on and flashes on the dash. It is very random and sometimes it doesnt do it at all. There can be nothing in front of me on the road when it starts flashing. It also does it in all weather conditions, and even when its dry.  There have been multiple issues with this car since the day I purchased it.
1. The automatic emergency braking activated while approaching a railway crossing. And yes, it is available for inspection.  2. If anyone had been behind me, it very likely would have resulted in a collision.  3. Not yet confirmed by the dealer,  but has happened to me three times.  4. No. 5. No warning before the malfunction.
My car constantly turns off mid drive and then turns back on , also all the lights on my dash pop up eveytime I start the car so I’m pretty sure it’s an electric issue sometimes it’s doesn’t start I have to play with the battery  little bit and I’ve had it tested even bought a new one so ik it’s not the battery it’s electric, it frequently turns off for like 5 seconds while I’m driving and then turns back on
While parked and waiting for drive-thru service, my Nissan Rogue began to smoke and immediately turned into flames under the hood. There was no malfunction or problems before this incident. Approximately 15 minutes prior to the incident, the driver stopped and filled truck with gas. After driving from the gas station, the driver went approximately 10 miles for food, where the car began smoking, and flames coming from under the hood. There were no warning signs, messages or malfunctions prior to this incident. The car was running quietly and smoothly and had not encountered any problems prior to the incident.

I AM GOING TO CALL THEM AGAIN TODAY.  IF I HAD BEEN IN THE CAR I WOULD HAVE BEEN BADLY BURNT OR DEAD.  *TR
AS MY SON AND I WENT ON A DAY TRIP WITH MY SISTER AND NIECES TO THE OCEAN MY CAR DECREASED SPEED FROM 75 MPH TO 30 REAL QUICK PEOPLE BEHIND US SWERVED OFF OF THE ROAD AVOIDING HITTING US. I PUSHED THE GAS PEDAL ALL THE WAY DOWN AND THE CAR WOULD NOT EVEN ACCELERATE.  I HAD TO  STOP AT A GAS STATION SO I COULD CALL SOMEONE TO LET THEM KNOW OF THE CAR PROBLEMS I WAS HAVING. I TOOK BACK ROADS HOME BECAUSE I DID NOT FEEL THE CAR IS SAFE FOR US. I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT IT IS DOING THIS AS I HAVE ONLY HAD IT SINCE 2010.   *TR
WHILE DRIVING MY 2010 NISSAN ROGUE S TRYING TO ENTER A MAIN HIGHWAY, THE CAR SUDDENLY LOST ALL POWER AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH GAS WAS GIVEN THE CAR WOULD NOT ACCELERATE. AFTER SAFELY MAKING IT OFF THE HIGHWAY AT THE NEXT EXIT AND PULLING OVER, THE CAR WOULD STILL NOT GO OVER 5 MPH AND HAD NO REVERSE. THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED A MAJOR ACCIDENT WHICH COULD OF INJURED OR KILLED BOTH MY PASSENGERS AND I AND ANY OTHER MOTORIST APPROACHING ME AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AS I WAS ATTEMPTING TO ENTER THE ROADWAY.   *JS

The source of the fire was undetermined however, it began under the front hood. No injuries were sustained. No medical attention was sought. The local dealer was not contacted. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 175,000.
When it rains, water leaks down on my left foot when I'm driving. Etc. Catalytic converter issues.
The CVT transmission shuts off unexpectedly and for no reason. I was driving downhill, at 65 mph, in an empty car, with no load and the transmission just went into shutdown. This happened multiple times (more than 5) . I do not trust Nissan to fix it.
1 OWNER CAR. MILEAGE 80,000. AIR BAG LIGHTS CAME ON BY SEAT AND ON DASH EVEN WHEN AN ADULT IS SITTING IN PASSENGER SEAT WHEN IGNITION IS ON. TOOK TO DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD ENTIRE SEAT MUST BE REPLACED BECAUSE OF THE SENSOR AT A COST OF $3000. THIS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN REPORTED BY MANY PEOPLE. THIS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT. THEY KEPT PUTTING THIS PART IN EVEN AFTER THEY STARTING FAILING IN 2008, 2009, 2010  MODELS. WE ARE REQUIRED FOR THIS TO WORK TO GET OUR CARS INSPECTED. THAT IS HALF THE VALUE OF THE CAR. THE ENTIRE SEAT MUST BE REPLACED??!!??  I DON'T KNOW IF THE BAG WILL DEPLOY OR NOT IF THERE IS AN ACCIDENT. HOW LONG UNTIL THE OTHER ONE FAILS.

ON 11/3/18, I STOPPED MY 2011NISSAN ROGUE TO LET A FRIEND OUT OF THE VEHICLE.  I PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE AND NOTHING HAPPENED.  THE CAR WOULD NOT GO INTO GEAR.  I HAD IT TOWED TO AAA THE NEXT DAY AND THEY DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS THE CVT TRANSMISSION.  THEY ADVISED ME TO CONTACT NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS BECAUSE THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM THEY SEE WITH NISSANS AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP.  I CONTACTED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS ON NOVEMBER 5 AND "ADAM" WAS VERY UNDERSTANDING.   HE CHECKED MY VIN # AND SAID THAT MY VEHICLE WAS NOT SPECIFICALLY COVERED UNDER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY, BUT THAT NISSAN WOULD STILL BE WILLING TO ASSIST WITH THE REPAIR COSTS.  HE SAID I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED TO A NISSAN SERVICE CENTER AND HAVE A DIAGNOSTIC DONE BY THEM AS A FIRST STEP.  I TOLD HIM A DIAGNOSTIC HAD ALREADY BEEN DONE BY AAA, BUT HE SAID NISSAN HAD TO DO IT THEMSELVES IN ORDER TO MAKE THE NECESSARY REPAIRS.  I THEN HAD THE CAR TOWED TO SANSONE 66  IN NEPTUNE CITY, NJ.  I HAD ANOTHER DIAGNOSTIC DONE WHICH CONFIRMED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS THE CVT TRANSMISSION.  I THEN CONTACTED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS AGAIN TO ADVISE THEM THAT THE DIAGNOSTIC WAS COMPLETED.  THEY TOLD ME THAT A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT IN NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS WOULD BE CONTACTING ME THE NEXT DAY WITH INFORMATION ON HOW MY PROBLEM WAS GOING TO BE RESOLVED.  I WAS THEN CONTACTED BY CONSUMER AFFAIRS REP "QUINCY" ON NOVEMBER 11.  SHE ADVISED ME THAT SHE WOULD BE MAKING THE DECISION ON HOW/IF NISSAN WOULD BE RESOLVING MY CVT PROBLEM.  I ASKED HER IF SHE HAD RECEIVED A COPY OF THE DIAGNOSTIC REPORT FROM SANSONE SO SHE COULD USE THAT TO RENDER HER DECISION.  SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD NOT, BUT THAT HER DECISION WOULD IN LARGE PART BE BASED ON "CUSTOMER LOYALTY".  I ASKED WHAT SHE MEANT AND WAS TOLD THAT SHE WAS REFERRING TO PAST SERVICE HISTORY AT NISSAN DEALERS.  SHE DENIED ME ANY ASSISTANCE WITH THE REPAIR.
THE VEHICLE'S CLEAR COAT IS PEELING OFF THE ROOF AREA, EXPOSING THE PAINT.
THE CVT TRANSMISSION HAS GONE INTO FAIL/SAFE MODE 4 DIFFERENT TIMES WHICH RESTRICTS THE VEHICLES ABILITY TO ACCELERATE AND LIMITS THE SPEED. 1ST PROBLEM OCCURRED IN OCT 2015 WITH 33,100 MILES. WHEN DRIVEN ON THE INTERSTATE,1 1/2 INTO DRIVE CAR WOULD NOT ACCELERATE  AND I COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH TRAFFIC. I CONTACTED 2 DEALERSHIPS LOKEY & COURTESY THAT HAD NO EXPLANATION, BECAUSE NO WARNING LIGHTS WERE ON THAT MEANT THERE WAS NOT A PROBLEM. THE 2ND PROBLEM I4 AGAIN. VERY FRIGHTENING  AGAIN, ASKED NISSAN DEALER. AGAIN, NO WARNING LIGHT NO ISSUE. APRIL 2018. I WAS ON I75 S WHEN THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY BEGAN TO LOSE SPEED. I KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND PULLED OVER. A WARNING LIGHT DID ELIMINATE. I WAS NOT ABLE TO SUSTAIN 45 MPH AND STOPPED. I LOOKED AT THE MANUAL, IT LOOKED LIKE A MISFIRE OR EMISSION ISSUE. NO BIG DEAL, OKAY TO KEEP DRIVING PER MANUAL.  IF CONTINUE, SEE DEALER. I DID NOT KNOW NISSAN KNEW ABOUT THIS ISSUE SINCE 2008. I DROVE MY CAR HOME BACK TO TAMPA AT 9 PM. HAD I BEEN NOTIFIED THAT THIS ISSUE WAS NOT NORMAL I WOULD HAVE HAD IT TOWED HOME. 10;30PM I WAS ON I75 N NOT ABLE TO MAINTAIN 45 MPH. I WAS IN A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION. I WAS GOING 45 IN A 70!! I HAD 1 IDIOT TAIL ME FOR 1.7 MILES. I WAS PUT IN THAT SITUATION BY NISSAN. I BOUGHT THIS CAR BECAUSE THE SALESMAN FOOLED ME INTO THINKING I WAS BUYING A SAFE CAR. IT IS THE OPPOSITE. WHY IS THIS ACCEPTABLE. NISSAN EXTENDED THE WARRANTY FOR 2008-2010 BUT NOT 2011??? 2011 CLEARLY HAS THE SAME ISSUE. MY CAR SHOWED ISSUES AT 33,100 UNDER WARRANTTY BUT THE DEALER PURPOSEFULLY DID NOT DISCLOSE THE DANGER. I JUST PAID $4589.00 TO HAVE MY TRANSMISSION REBUILT. ONLY TO HAVE IT BREAK DOWN WITHIN AN HOUR OF PICKING IT UP. DEFECTIVE BEARING. MY CAR HAS BEEN OUT OF USE FOR 1 WEEK AND COUNTING. NISSAN FAILS TO HELP ME NOR TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DANGEROUS AND POTENTIALLY DEADLY SITUATION. NISSAN RIPPING US OFF. STOP NOW!!
MY WIFE WAS DRIVING THIS NISSAN ROGUE 2011 AND IT STOPPED MOVING. I HAD IT TOWED TO A NISSAN DEALER ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS SHOT AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. IT ONLY HAD 55,296 MILES ON IT AT THE TIME.  THIS OCCURRED ON 11/21/2017.    FORTUNATELY THIS DID NOT OCCUR ON A HIGHWAY, BUT RATHER ON A LOCAL STREET.      I KNOW THAT NISSAN DOUBLED THE WARRANRIES ON THE CVT TRANSMISSIONS ON THE 2008 TO 2010 ROGUES, BUT NOT ON ANYTHING AFTER THAT.  WHAT A BUMMER!!  EVIDENTLY THEY DID NOT FIX THEIR PROBLEMS..
CVT TRANSMISSION AND COOLER - VEHICLE RANDOMLY DROPS ACCELERATION.  WHEN ACCELERATION DROPS, THE CAR WILL NOT GO ABOVE 40MPH EVEN IF YOU PUT THE PEDAL TO THE FLOOR, AND THE RPMS RISE TO 8.  NO RHYME OR REASON.  THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THIS TRANSMISSION.  NISSAN ONLY EXTENDED WARRANTY TO 2010 MODELS, YET THIS IS THE EXACT ISSUE COVERED UNDER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.  THERE ARE MANY OTHER NISSAN OWNERS WITH 2011 MODELS WITH THE SAME EXACT ISSUE.
PASSENGER AIR BAG LIGHT HAS COME ON AND STAYED ON--WITHOUT ANYONE OR THING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. DEALER SAYS THAT MUST MEAN THE PASSENGER AIRBAG IS DEACTIVATED.  CONTACTED NISSAN--THEY SAY IT WILL COST $2100 TO FIX.  THEY WANT US TO PAY $700 OF THAT--SINCE THE CAR IS 5 YEARS OLD.  IT HAS 83,000 MILES ON IT.  SINCE AIRBAGS ARE A FEDERALLY MANDATED SAFETY FEATURE, I WOULD THINK THAT NISSAN SHOULD PAY ALL OF THE COST OF THIS FIX.
SINCE PURCHASING MY 201 ROGUE IN 2012, WITH 4,000 MILES ON IT, WHENEVER DRIVING FOR MORE THAN 35-40 MINUTES, HAVE TOTAL LOSS OF ACCELERATION.  HAPPENS ON HIGHWAY, DURNING DRIVING AROUND TOWN AND FROM A COMPLETE STOP.  OCCURS NO MATTER THE TIME OF YEAR OR THE WEATHER CONDITIONS.  RESEARCHED AND FOUND ON LINE THIS HAPPENS TO MULTITUDES OF OWNERS OF NISSAN 4CYL VEHICLES WITH CVT.  NO FIX HAS BEEN NOTED, JUST WAITING FOR A SERIOUS ACCIDENT OR DEATH, BEFORE NISSAN OR GOVERNMENT DOES ANYTHING.  CAN NOT AFFORD TO JUST GO BUY ANOTHER VEHICLE.  WILL NOT EVER BUY ANOTHER NISSAN 4CYL WITH THE CVT.  DISAPPOINTED, CONCERNED AND HOPING I AM NOT THE FATALITY,
I AM BEYOND UPSET AND DOWN RIGHT FRUSTRATED WITH NISSAN. BOTH OF THE NISSAN I HAVE OWNED HAVE HAD THE TRANSMISSIONS GO OUT IN THEM.  ONE AT 120,000 MILES AND THE OTHER AT UNDER 85,000. THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND COULD POTENTIALLY KILL SOMEONE!  I JUST HAD A USED TRANSMISSION WITH 22,000 PUT IN AND THE SAME [XXX] ISSUE IS HAPPENING.  I OWE OVER 10K ON MY VEHICLE AND AM GOING TO HAVE THE HARDEST TIME SELLING THIS. FRANKLY, I FEEL GUILTY SELLING THIS TO ANYONE. I HAVE BEEN JIPPED ALONG WITH COUNTLESS OTHERS FROM WHAT I HAVE READ ONLINE.     THE CAR WILL NOT ACCELERATE IN REVERSE AND IN DRIVE WHEN THE PEDAL IS PRESSED ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR. THE SLIP LIGHT WILL COME ON AND MAKE AN AWFUL WHINING/GRINDING SOUND. THIS CAR NEEDS TO BE RECALLED AND OFF ALL ROADS BEFORE IT INJURES OR KILLS MORE PEOPLE!

I PURCHASED MY 2011 NISSAN ROGUE IN 2011 BRAND NEW. IN DEC 2013, AS I WOULD DRIVE TO/FROM WORK I FELT THE CAR WAS TRYING TO LOWER ITS SPEED WHILE I KEPT MY FOOT ON THE GAS PEDAL. IT CAUSED ME TO SLOW UP TRAFFIC. THEN THE CAR WOULD NOT LET ME GO HIGHER THAN 20 MPH. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO OF THIS AND TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC, THEY ADVISED ME IT WAS THE TRANSMISSION THAT I WOULD NEED A NEW ONE. SO I CONTACT MY NISSAN DEAL AND THEY FIXED IT. NOW JULY 2015, LESS THAN 2 YEARS LATER WITH A NEW TRANSMISSION AT 60,000 MILES THE POWER TRAIN GOT WORSE. AS I WAS DRIVING UP A HILL THERE WAS A RED TRAFFIC LIGHT SO I STOPPED MY VEHICLE. ONCE THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN I LET GO OF THE GAS PEDAL AND PRESSED ON THE GAS PEDAL AND IT DID NOT MOVE. THERE WERE A LOT OF CARS BEHIND ME AND LUCKILY MY CAR DID NOT START TO BACKWARDS. BUT I WAS EXTREMELY NERVOUS AND FELT THIS DEFECT WILL BE THE CAUSE OF MY FIRST ACCIDENT. THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND IT SHOULD BE RECALLED. WHEN I HAD MY HONDA IT NEVER DID THIS TO ME AND I PUT ON IT 100,000 MILES. PLEASE HELP!!!

The contact owns a 2012 Nissan Rogue. The contact stated while driving 55 MPH, the vehicle failed to accelerate as intended while depressing the accelerator pedal, before the engine seized. No warning lights were illuminated. The contact was able to coast to the side of the road. The contact noticed black smoke coming from under the hood. The vehicle was towed to the dealer; however, no cause for the failure was found. The contact had the spark plugs and boots replaced. The vehicle was towed to the residence. The contact stated that an abnormal sound was coming from the engine when the vehicle was restarted. The check engine warning light and the TPMS warning lights were illuminated. The failure had progressively worsened, and the vehicle was no longer driven. In addition, the contact stated that the vehicle was consuming an excessive amount of gasoline. The manufacturer was not informed of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 210,000.
The CVT component on these cars causes it to lose power and acceleration which can cause an bad accident..one morning while going to work i got onto the expressway and car did not want to acceleration and almost caused me to get into a collision with an 18 wheeler.. The next day i took it to an mechanic shop whereas they told me nothing was wrong with my car and i should contact nissan and complain because the only problem they can guess is its my CVT and nissan made the car to do that so it last longer.. Then 2 days later I was driving on a commercial road with lots of traffic when all of a sudden my car would not acceleration even when I pushed the pedal to the floor.. I pulled over and turned the car off for awhile and then Crunk it back up and it was accelerating better.. so over the course of 5 months I have been having this problem with my car when I come to a stop or when I decelerate and then accelerate.. I did some research to find out what could be the problem and I came across a thread of other consumers that were having the same exact problem with the nissan brand of cars and suv's.. even though they know this problem exists with their make and models they provide no solution other than spend more money on a car they designed with a defective transmission and/or other components.. this is a serious safety concern for anyone driving these cars or suvs from nissan..

MY CAR WILL LOSE ACCELERATION DURING A DRIVE LASTING MORE THAN ABOUT 90MIN AT GREATER THAN ABOUT 65MI/HR, SOONER IF IT'S HOTTER OUTSIDE. IT FIRST HAPPENED TO ME TRAVELING FROM TENNESSE TO FLORIDA THEN BACK. IT SLOWLY STARTED TO DECELERATE AND THE RPMS CLIMB IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL. I HAD TO PULL OVER A FEW TIMES TO LET THE CAR COOL DOWN IN ORDER TO CONTINUE. WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN 8HR DRIVE TURNED INTO A 10HR DRIVE. THAT WAS IN JUNE. NOT WE'RE IN JULY WHERE TEMPS HAVE BEEN 95&#8304;-100&#8304; THE LAST FEW DAYS AND I'M PULLED OVER AGAIN WHILE TRAVELING,  THIS TIME I ONLY MADE IT ABOUT 1HR. I'M HOPING NO DAMAGE HAS OCCURRED AND I CAN GET MOVING SOON. MY 4HR ROUND TRIP WILL BE MUCH LONGER TODAY. I WISH I'D KNOWN THIS ABOUT THE CVT BEFORE PURCHASING THIS VEHICLE.

NISSAN INSTALLED DEFECTIVE CVT TRANSMISSIONS IN SEVERAL VEHICLES BETWEEN 2010-2016. MY 2012 NISSAN ROGUE IS INCLUDED IN THAT. I AM NOW BEING TOLD THAT I NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION, AND NISSAN IS REFUSING TO REPLACE. IT. MY VEHICLE STARTS FINE, BUT THE TRANSMISSION HAS FAILED. AFTER LOOKING ONLINE, I'VE FOUND NUMEROUS OTHER COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME ISSUE, AND I FEEL THERE NEEDS TO BE A FURTHER INVESTIGATION, AND RECALL ON THIS CVT TRANSMISSION. THE VEHICLE STARTS, BUT WHEN YOU TRY AND ACCELERATE,  THE RPMS GO UP, BUT NOTHING HAPPENS, THEN IT WILL SCREECH AND LURCH FORWARD. I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP, WHO CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION. THE SALESPERSON AT THE DEALERSHIP ADVISED ME THAT NISSAN WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE OLDER CVT TRANSMISSIONS, AND HAVE FIXED IT IN THE NEW 2019 MODELS. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE, AS MY TRANSMISSION FAILED IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC, WITH NO WARNING.

I OWN A 2012 NISSAN ROGUE.  I PURCHASED IT USED IN 2015 WITH APPROXIMATELY 60,000 MILES ON IT.  IN ABOUT APRIL OF 2018 I STARTED EXPERIENCING THE CAR NOT ACCELERATING AFTER DRIVING ON THE EXPRESSWAY. I WOULD BE DRIVING 65-75 MPH AND SUDDENLY THE CAR WOULD SLOW DOWN AND NOT ACCELERATE.  THIS IS IN HEAVY TRAFFIC MIND YOU.  I WOULD PULL OVER AND SIT FOR ABOUT 15-20 MINUTES.  AFTER THAT TIME I WOULD RESTART THE CAR AND THE CAR WOULD DRIVE AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED.  I WOULD EXPERIENCE THIS EACH TIME I WOULD GET ON THE EXPRESSWAY AFTER DRIVING FOR ABOUT 50-60 MINUTES.  I TOOK IT TO MY MECHANIC AND HE TOLD ME THE TRANSMISSION WAS FAILING. I COULD NOT GET ANOTHER CAR DUE TO THE FACT THAT I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF PAYING FOR THIS CAR AND OWE TOO MUCH TO TRADE IT. IN JULY 2018 I DID NOT HAVE TO TRAVEL THE EXPRESSWAY AS MUCH. I THOUGHT THAT  I COULD CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE CAR THINKING IF I DIDN'T TRAVEL THAT FAR I MAY BE OK UNTIL I GET THE CAR PAID DOWN SOME MORE.  TO MY SURPRISE THAT JUST DID NOT HAPPEN. IN AUGUST 2018 I STARTED HEARING A KNOCKING SOUND AND TOOK IT BACK TO THE MECHANIC TO FIND OUT THAT THE DRIVE SHAFT WAS BAD. SOME OF HIS CUSTOMERS BROUGHT THEIR NISSAN ROGUE'S TO HIM WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  THE PROBLEM IS VERY EXPENSIVE TO FIX AND A USED PART MAY NOT BE THE ANSWER DUE TO THE FACT THAT ALL OF THE ROGUE'S ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM.  WELL, AT THIS POINT I AM WITHOUT TRANSPORTATION. THE KNOCKING TURNED INTO A LOUD NOISE COMING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR, AS IF EVERYTHING UNDERNEATH WAS ON THE VERGE OF FALLING OFF.  I CANNOT DRIVE THE CAR AND HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED TO MY HOME BECAUSE THE MECHANIC CANNOT FIND A SUITABLE USED PART TO REPLACE THE PROBLEM AND I CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE THE PROBLEM FIXED WITH A NEW PART.  SO I ALSO AM PAYING FOR A CAR THAT I CANNOT DRIVE.  NISSAN REALLY NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM, AS IT IS A DEFECT FROM THE MANUFACTURER.
CVT TRANSMISSION FAILURE. AS I WAS DRIVING ON THE PARKWAY HIS CAR WILL JUST SLOW DOWN TO A CRAWL CAUSING A DANGEROUS DRIVING CONDITION. THE CAR WILL BARELY MOVE AND MANY OTHER VEHICLES HAVE COME VERY CLOSE TO HITTING ME DUE TO THE SLOW SPEED THAT THE CAR WILL GO. COMPLAINED TO NISSAN BUT SINCE CAR IS 11 MONTHS PAST WARRANTY WAS TOLD THEY WILL NOT HELP EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A KNOW PROBLEM WITH THESE CARS.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 NISSAN ROGUE. WHILE DRIVING 40 MPH, THE VEHICLE WENT INTO NEUTRAL AND IT SEEMED LIKE THE ENGINE STOPPED WITHOUT WARNING. A FEW MOMENTS LATER, THE VEHICLE DROVE NORMALLY. THE LOCAL DEALER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 62,000.
WHILE DRIVING, THE VEHICLE WILL START SHUDDERING AND RPM'S WILL INCREASE BY 2000-3000 RPMS EVEN IF THERE IS NO ASSISTANCE WITH ACCELERATION (FOOT IS OFF GAS PEDAL).  WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THE CAR WILL THEN NO LONGER ACCELERATE, AND WILL START SLOWING DOWN, REGARDLESS IF YOU AT PRESSING THE GAS OR NOT. YOU BASICALLY LOSE ALL CONTROL OVER THE OPERATING SPEED OF THE VEHICLE. THIS HAS HAPPENED OVER 10 TIMES WITHIN THE PAST 3 MONTHS, ALL WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AT POSTED SPEEDS, APPROX. 65 MPH FOR ANYWHERE BETWEEN 5 MIN TO AN HOUR + OF CONSTANT RATE OF SPEED.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 NISSAN ROGUE. WHILE DRIVING 75 MPH, THE VEHICLE SLOWED DOWN INDEPENDENTLY WHILE THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WAS BEING DEPRESSED. THE DEALER DIAGNOSED THAT THE MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 54,000.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNED A 2012 NISSAN ROGUE. WHILE DRIVING 40 MPH, THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS DEPRESSED BUT FAILED TO RESPOND WITHOUT WARNING. THE CONTACT'S VEHICLE REAR ENDED ANOTHER VEHICLE. THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED. THE CONTACT SUSTAINED BRUISING TO HER CHEST AND A HAIRLINE FRACTURE TO THE RIGHT KNEE. MEDICAL ATTENTION WAS REQUIRED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 35,000. THE VEHICLE WAS DESTROYED AND TOWED. THE VIN WAS NOT AVAILABLE.
AFTER THE VEHICLE GETS WARM THE TRANSMISSION WILL INTERMITTENTLY WHINE (STARTED AFTER 50,000 MILES.  IT INCREASES WITH SPEED AND IS MOST NOTICEABLE WITH THE WINDOW OPEN.  IT ALSO STARTS TO LOOSE POWER IF YOU CONTINUE TO DRIVE IT.  IF YOU PARK AND LET THE TRUCK SIT FOR A FEW MINUTES THE WHINING STOPS.  TOOK IT TO THE DEALER TODAY AND THEY SAY THEY CANNOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  I ALSO HAD A 2010 NISSAN ROGUE WHICH DID THE VERY SAME THING AT ALMOST THE SAME MILEAGE.  NISSAN DID REPLACE THE CVT TRANSMISSION ON THAT ONE.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 NISSAN ROGUE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE ENGAGING THE BRAKES, THE DRIVER SEAT MOVED FORWARD INDEPENDENTLY AND THE AIR BAG LIGHT ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER. THE TECHNICIAN WAS UNABLE TO FIND A FAILURE. THE DRIVER SEAT WAS REPLACED, BUT THE FAILURE PERSISTED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 2.
ORIGINALLY THE CAR WOULD HESITATE, BOG,ONLY WHILE TURNING OR SLIGHTLY ROLLING. ADDITIONALLY NOW IT HESITATES FROM A DEAD STOP. SOMETIMES IT HESITATES,GOES,THEN HESITATES AGAIN.   IT IS  AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM BUT IT OCCURS WHILE PULLING OUT INTO TRAFFIC OR TURNING THROUGH A LIGHT.  I'M AFRAID THE CAR WILL STALL AND I'LL BE HIT BROADSIDE OR FROM BEHIND.  THE DEALER HAS LOOKED AT THE CAR 4 TIMES AND SAYS IT'S THE WAY THE CVT TRANSMISSION WORKS.  THE CAR DID NOT DO THIS DURING THE FIRST 2000 MILES. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR 50 YEARS AND NEVER HAD A CAR OPERATE SO DANGEROUSLY.   I AM IN A LEASE AND NISSAN WILL NOT TAKE THE CAR BACK.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  *TR
During a rear end accident on the highway when someone slammed on their brakes, I hit them at around 40 mph and slamming on my brakes to prevent it and the airbags did not deploy. The light was on the dashboard after the accident as if they did the deploy, the seatbelt blew out and will no longer retract. The front frame of the vehicle bent inwards at a 90 degrees angle puncturing the AC compressor, though the bumper has minimal damage. MA State Troopers noted that damage and allowed me to drive off since "the vehicle is not over heating or leaking", a body shop then said my car is totaled. My insurance company is investigating why/how the frame obtained extensive damage though the outer body is not as damaged. The vehicle has been parked since the accident and is available for inspection. My safety was at risk with a significant crash and the airbags not deploying, the seatbelt injured me, I am under medical treatment for injuries obtained after this accident. I have a police report, I have an insurance claim, I believe this needs to be further investigated. My vehicle was bought used in 2017 from a Nissan Dealership, it has never been in an accident with me as the owner, but my insurance company found an unreported accident from 2014 which could relate to the airbags not deploying and the frame bending so significantly from a rear end accident.
Transmission problem out of no where. Acceleration changed with a high reving/whining noise, with no power on the gas pedal while turning left, putting me and my family at risk. There were no warning lights and no warning whatsoever. There has been no recall with this type of CVT transmission as there should as it is a HIGH RISK of DANGER on the road! I can't even believe that Nissan won't even address the issue. Do not buy this vehicle! Auto parts stores do not even carry parts for this car to replace transmission or torqure converter you have to go to NISSAN dealership(That should tell you SOMETHING) and they won't address the safety the issue nor do they care. PLEASE recall this transmission issue. It is a defect all the way  Very unsafe. The cost to replace the transmission through the dealer is a lot of money just to have it be defective again down the road is NOT WORTH your safety.

The contact owns a 2013 Nissan Rogue. The contact stated that while operating the vehicle, the air bag warning light remained illuminated. The vehicle was taken to the local dealer who diagnosed that the airbag clockspring was faulty and needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not yet repaired.

After turning off and restarting the vehicle, the vehicle operated as normal. The failure recurred on several occasions with the cruise control activated. The cause of the failure was not determined. The manufacturer and local dealer were notified of the failure. The failure mileage was 92,000.
When driving home from Demark S.C to Milledgeville, Ga.  last Sunday when around the car stop accelerating and was making a whining noise.. The R.P. M. meter was over 8 and the speedometer was stuck on 60 m.p.h. This went on for around ten minuets, Then started back to normal. This is the second time happened when taking a similar.
Vehicle loses power/ability to accelerate on longer drives, especially when up/down hills are involved.
THE CARS PASSENGER AIRBAG LIGHT WILL STAY ILLUMINATED AS OFF WHEN NO ONE OR NOTHING IS IN THE SEAT. THIS LIGHT SHOULD GO OFF WITHIN 7 SECONDS OF THE CAR TURNING ON. AND WHEN AN ADULT PASSENGER OF ADEQUATE SIZE GETS IN THE SEAT IT MAY OR MAY NOT REMAIN OFF. THIS MEANS THAT THE AIRBAG MAY NOT DEPLOY IF NEEDED BECAUSE THE OCS SENSOR IS NOT PROPERLY REGISTERING THE WEIGHT OF THE PASSENGER. THE PASSENGER SEATBELT LIGHT WILL ALSO REMAIN ON AFTER A PASSENGER EXITS THE VEHICLE AS IF SOMEONE IS STILL SEATING THERE AND NEEDS TO APPLY THE SEATBELT. ANOTHER FAULT OF THE OCS SENSOR. THE CAR HAS BEEN STATIONARY AND IN MOTION WHEN THIS OCCURS. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE. I HAVE CONTACTED NISSAN AND BEEN TOLD THAT MY CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY AND THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO AT THIS TIME. OTHER ROGUE MODEL YEARS AND NISSANS IN GENERAL HAVE BEEN RECALLED FOR THIS SAME ISSUE YET NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE FOR THE 2013 ROGUE. I WAS TOLD THAT I NEED A NEW SEAT AT A VALUE OF $2600-$3000. THIS IS CLEARLY A NISSAN ISSUE NOT A CUSTOMER ISSUE. IT NEEDS TO BE RECALLED AND FIXED. T
THE CAR STARTS TO LAG AND DECELERATE WHEN TRYING TO GO OVER 50MPH..IT SPUTTERS WHEN SITTING AT RED LIGHTS/STOP SIGNS. CAR ONLY HAS 70,000 MILES ON IT, AND TOOK IT TO MECHANIC TODAY WHO STATED IT WAS THE CVT AND THAT ITS COMMON WITH 2013-2016 MODELS. THERE ARE SO MANY COMPLAINTS ON THESE CVT TRANSMISISONS, ITS CRAZY THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY RECALLS YET. THERE WERE LEMON LAWS IN OTHER STATES PROTECTING OTHER NISSAN MODELS FOR CVT ISSUES , WHICH HAVE ALREADY EXPIRED, HOWEVER THERE SEEM TO BE NONE FOR NISSAN  ROGUE..I GUESS NO RECALLS WILL BE DONE UNTIL ONE OF US DIES..WHICH IS A SHAME..

A MONTH AGO I WAS HAVING ACCELERATION ISSUES WITH MY VEHICLE. I WAS AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT AND COULD NOT MAKE THE LEFT TURN BECAUSE MY VEHICLE WOULD NOT ACCELERATE. I WAS ABLE TO PULL MY VEHICLE TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND HAD IT TOWED. I BROUGHT IT TO NISSAN AND  PAID ALMOST $5K FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION. (2ND TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT IN THE LAST 3 YEARS). A MONTH LATER HAVING SAME ACCELERATION ISSUE, NISSAN A WEEK LATER SAID I NEEDED A FUEL PUMP.  DROVE HOME FROM THE DEALERSHIP AFTER PAYING ANOTHER $915 AND MY VEHICLE IS GIVING OFF A BURNING SMELL, MAKING HORRIBLE NOISE WHICH WASN'T PRESENT PREVIOUSLY AND STRUGGLING TO DRIVE.

I NOTICED MANY SIMILAR COMPLAINT WITH THIS BRAND MODEL! WHY YOUR COMPANY DOES NOT ENFORCE A SAFETY LAWS AND FINE THE NISSAN COMPANY FOR SELLING DEFECTIVE CARS TO THE PUBLIC WHERE THEY PUT PEOPLE LIFE IN DANGER?  WHAT BOY , IF I WAS STUCK BY BIG TRUCK OR THE CARS IN THE FREEWAY AND DIED! WOULD NISSAN COMPANY ACCEPT ANY LIABILITY?  THE NISSAN COMPANY SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR THE IRRESPONSIBLE ACT . I BOUGHT THE CAR FOR 24000.00$ AND STILL ARE PAYING MY MONTHLY PAYMENT AND IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO ME AT ALL THAT I HAVE TO SPENT ANOTHER 4000.00$ FROM MY POCKET TO FIX THEIR FAULT DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSION?

MY CAR WAS IN THE MOTION 60 MILES AN HOUR IN THE FREE WAY AND SPEED WENT DOWN BY ITSELF, M AND THE TRANSMISSION START ACTING,... YOU PUT IN DRIVE OR REVERSE IT DOES NOT MOVE AT ALL?????? THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINT  SIMILAR T O MINE AT YOUR DATA BASE OR OTHER COMPANY OR GOOGLE,...  IT IS A SAFETY RISK TO DRIVE THIS KING OF NISSAN IN THE ROAD, ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGH WAY, EVEN 5 YEARS OLD KNOWS THAT.

I STARTED MY CAR ONE DAY AND STARTED TO SMELL SOMETHING BURNING.  I SAW NO SMOKE AND IMMEDIATELY SHUT THE CAR OFF.  I WENT INTO MY HOME AND GOT MY HUSBAND TO COME AND CHECK THE CAR.  HE STARTED IT UP AND THE BURNING SMELL CONTINUED.  AGAIN, WE IMMEDIATELY SHUT THE CAR OFF.  MY ROGUE WAS PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY I WENT TO USE MY CAR.  MY HUSBAND ADVISED TO LEAVE THE CAR ALONE AND TAKE HIS TRUCK.  THE NEXT DAY WE WENT OUT TO CHECK ONTO THE CAR AND IT STARTED RIGHT UP WITH NO BURNING SMELL BUT MY "CHECK ENGINE" AND "ABS" LIGHTS STAYED ON.

I HAD TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH MY NYS ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO GET NISSAN'S ATTENTION ONLY TO RECEIVE A LETTER TELLING MY MY PARTICULAR VEHICLE WAS NOT UNDER RECALL AND THEY WOULDN'T HELP.  HOW CAN AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM WHEN SOMETHING OBVIOUSLY BURNED NOT BE THEIR RESPONSIBILITY?  I HAVE HAD MY CAR REGULARLY SERVICED AT MY LOCAL NISSAN DEALER AND HAVE LESS THAN 60000 MILES.  THE CAR STILL SITS UNUSABLE IN MY DRIVEWAY.

There is a water leak on the driver side floor and the body shop can figure out where it's coming from. My vehicle also had issues with the latch due to corrosion. The body shop was able to fix that issue. My navigation system and dash turns off and on as I am driving. The bodyshop can't find any issues with that either. Clear something is wrong with it.

The vehicle has a CVT issue that causes the error code P17F1. The vehicle has 143K plus mileage as a result Nissan doesn't was to fix it. The car stalls while in motion and has to be stopped and restarted presenting a huge safety concern. The sad part is Nissan knows about this quality issue and there was no recall to fix it. Now they are using the high mileage as the reason to not fix the problem.

Please note that I attempted to report this to Nissan today, but the first call I was hung up on after describing why I was calling and the second call went unanswered.   At some point between 01/27/2022 and 01/31/2022, it was reported to me that my vehicle was destroyed by fire.

I own a 2015 Nissan Rogue Select S. I purchased the vehicle with 35,000 miles on it in 2016, a year and 1 month after it was first manufactured. From the day I drove it off the lot, I noticed an issue, where if my car was in gear, and stopped in traffic or at a light, with the A/C running, the RPMs would drop significantly and cause a judder, then the RPMs would return. After a few months of this, I took it back to the dealership I purchased the vehicle from, and was advised that they could not replicate what I was talking about and there was nothing wrong with the vehicle. It's been 7 years since then. While stopped at a light at the bottom of an offramp after driving down the freeway, with my 2 VERY young children in their car seats, vehicle failed to accelerate with the equivalent pressure placed on the accelerator. This caused the vehicle to "roll" through the intersection and having the green light change while I was still halfway through the intersection. When the oncoming traffic got their green a few were not paying close attention and I was nearly t-boned. This happened twice in the span of maybe a month and a half. No indication of failure. No lights on the dashboard, indicating an issue. Took it to a different Nissan dealership and had a diagnostic run, was advised it needs a new transmission and the code that came up was P1740. Vehicle has less than 81,000 miles on it. Unfortunately, per Nissan Consumer Affairs, my vehicle is "out of warranty" even with the extension that was just granted in June of 2022, my vehicles extended warranty under the class action was extended to Jan of 2022, but I was never made aware of the class action, nor given the opportunity to opt out of said action. Vehicle is still not repaired. Myself and kids are safe, but they both have a bit of PTSD from both incidents occurring. I'm lucky I can even get them to voluntarily get back into a car. let alone my car. I wish I never purchased it. It could have killed us more than once.
I bought the vehicle at 24,000 miles in 2015.  at 40,000 miles I went in for the normal oil change and was told that the transmission was bad and needed replaced.  Nissan replaced it.  When I purchased the car I was given an extended warranty.  I'm now at 116,000 miles and it loses acceleration power when driving (currently not being driven), and then all of a sudden the rpms jump up and it will go, causing danger while driving.  It also makes a very loud whining noise.  Had it towed to dealership and they diagnosed as bad transmission.  Extended warranty is not wanting to cover.  This is the second nissan I've bought that has had to have transmissions replaced due to the same failure.  It is dangerous that so many are having this issue and Nissan won't issue a recall for the transmission that they are putting out to the public know that they are dangerous.  I could've easily had a wreck or been rear-ended because of Nissan's failure.  I also am a healthcare traveler that is over 1200 miles away from home without a vehicle now.
Purchased with 89k miles, now has 130k miles. A few times at random the check engine light came on and then went off immediately, seemingly went off when I would tighten up my gas cap, so i thought this was the cause. Hit 130k miles and light comes on during my drive home from work, and this time is accompanied by my loss of acceleration. On Highway I couldn’t go over about 55mph without losing ability to accelerate, I pull off Highway, get to first stop light, and then I can’t get the car to accelerate from a stop at all without an extreme delay. I pull into the nearest repair shop and they run the codes on ECU and tell me it’s not reading any active codes, but history codes are showing transmission issues and that CVT transmissions are known for this and recommends I call Nissan Consumer Affairs. Literally zero noticeable issues prior to this incident! I call them & they don’t have my name attached to the VIN? They create a case and tell me there was a class action lawsuit settlement (I never got any notification whatsoever!!!) but that I’m outside of the extended warranty provided as a result of the settlement. I still owe $8k on this piece of shit and Nissan won’t do anything—It should be recalled!!! 2nd Nissan I’ve owned, the first one I bought with 14k miles on it & had to replace the transmission at 35k, warranty expired. I will never buy another Nissan ever again. Ever. They clearly knowingly put defective and unsafe transmissions in these cars, screw over their customers time and time again, & are never held responsible. I don’t have the money to replace this transmission or buy a new car and be $10k in the hole. I can’t get to & from work in this car & don’t feel remotely safe when driving it. I’m terrified I’m going to get tboned bc I won’t be able to accelerate, & it’s only a matter of time before it is completely toast. There will be blood on Nissan’s hands for these CVT’s. I’m not paying them to diagnose a widespread issue they are fully aware of!!
My car vibrates while idling when either air conditioner or heat is on (but only when the car is idling; waiting for light to change and not when moving. When my car was under warranty I reported this to my Nissan service repair mechanic when car was under warranty and was told that was normal. I purchased a car in 2016 and now in 2022 it is still happening. Just need to make sure I’m safe and that car won’t blow up or something. Thank you .
Airbag warning light came on Nissan check the problem and stated the vehicle needs a left front seat back also stated airbags will not work until the part is replaced.( Airbag is defective)
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 NISSAN ROGUE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT AFTER EXITING A HIGHWAY RAMP AT 60 MPH, THE VEHICLE JERKED AND STALLED WITHOUT WARNING WHILE DEPRESSING THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL. THE VEHICLE RESUMED NORMAL FUNCTION SOON AFTER EXPERIENCING THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT TAKEN TO BE DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED THAT THE VIN WAS NOT UNDER RECALL AND THAT THE WARRANTY ON THE VEHICLE WAS EXPIRED. NO FURTHER ASSISTANCE WAS PROVIDED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 107,754.
CAR STOPS ACCELERATING RANDOMLY. SOME DAYS IT WON'T GO OVER 60MPH WHILE I'M ALREADY DRIVING ON THE THRUWAY.  OTHER DAYS IT WILL DROP SPEED FROM 70 TO 60 AND I HAVE NO CONTROL OVER ACCELERATION. THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS ON THE HIGHWAY.
DRIVING ON HIGHWAY AT 70MPH WHEN I HEARD WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A GUNSHOT AND THEN MY SUNROOF EXPLODED CAUSING LARGE CHUNKS OF GLASS TO GO FLYING IN THE AIR AND ON THE HIGHWAY BEHIND ME. THERE WERE NO OTHER VEHICLES IN SIGHT.
THREE TIMES NOW THE CAR HAS SHUT DOWN ENTIRELY WHILE DRIVING IN TRAFFIC. ENGINE STOPS RUNNING, ALL LIGHTS AND POWER ARE OFF, POWER STEERING AND POWER BRAKES ARE LOST. IT CREATES AN INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS SCENARIO. CAR WILL RESTART ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BUT YOU HAVE TO ROLL TO A STOP WITH NO POWER BRAKES OR STEERING, AS I SAID IT'S INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS. HAPPENS MID-DRIVE, WITH CAR IN MOTION, INCLUDING AN INSTANCE GOING 70 MPH ON A BUSY INTERSTATE. HAS OCCURRED THREE TIMES OVER THE LAST TWO MONTHS.  *TR
REAR HATCH DOOR WONT CLOSE/LOCK
VEHICLE HAS STALLED AND WOULD START BUT NOT ACCELERATE AFTER FILLING TANK. THE ENGINE STARTS BUT HESITATES THEN DIES.  THIS REPEATS FOR AT LEAST THREE TIMES AND THEN THE VEHICLE STARTS AND DRIVES NORMAL.   THIS HAS OCCURRED AT LEAST THREE TIMES AFTER FILLING FUEL TANK IN THE LAST YEAR.
I AM DRIVING AND I COME TO THE RED LIGHT AND MY TEMPERATURE GAGE WENT TO HOT,IT WAS NOT A SAFE PLACE TO STOP SO DROVE IT0.7 AND CALLED A TOW...THEY SAID IT WAS MY RADIATOR AND I PAID OVER 500 FOR THAT,LESS THAN A MONTH LATER MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON BY SHULTS IN OLEAN SO I TOOK IT IN AND THEY SAID IT WAS THE HEAD GASKET,TAKE IT TO NISSAN JAMESTOWN, SO I HAD IT TOWED,,THEY SAID IT WAS COVERED BUT TODAY THEY SAID IT ISN'T
THERE HAS BEEN A RUBBING NOISE ON THE FRONT & REAR OF THE VEHICLE EVERY TIME YOU GO OVER A BUMP.  NO MATTER HOW SMALL A BUMP.  IT FEELS LIKE THE SUSPENSION OR SHOCKS ARE RUBBING.  THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE NEW.
VEHICLE LOSES POWER. THIS IS RANDOM BUT THE ESP LIGHT IS ALWAYS ON WHEN IT HAPPENS. THIS PROBLEM IS WORSE ON INCLINES. THE CAR WILL NOT MOVE. CAR HESITATES WHEN TRYING TO ACCELERATE. YOU CAN HAVE THE GAS PEDAL ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR AND THE CAR WON'T GO, OR BARELY MOVES.
THE CAR HAD BEEN PARKED 6:30 P.M. IN PRIVATE DRIVEWAY. AT 2:20 A.M. I WAS ALERTED BY MY NEIGHBOR . HE HAD SEEN THROUGH THE WOODS A FIRE, CALLED THE FIRE DEPT. HE THOUGHT OUR HOUSE WAS ON FIRE AND RAN OVER TO SEE IF WE WERE OK. IT WAS NOT OUR HOUSE BUT OUR 2015 NISSAN ROGUE.WHEN HE WOKE US THE CAR WAS TOTALLY ENGULFED IN FLAMES. THE FIRE DEPT ARRIVED MINUTES LATER AND IT TOOK AWHILE TO PUT THE FIRE TOTALLY OUT. NOTHING REMAINS OF THE CAR EXCEPT THE FRAMING. I HAD PURCHASED THIS CAR SIX MONTHS EARLIER WITH 20,000 MILES. IT HAD JUST TURNED 30,000 MILES. THERE WAS NO SIGN ANYTHING WAS AMISS, NO WARNING LIGHTS, ODD SOUNDS, NOTHING. WE LIVE IN A RURAL AREA, WOODED MILES OFF THE MAIN ROAD SO I DO NOT SUSPECT THIS WAS DONE BY HUMAN HANDS. I CAN ONLY IMAGE THIS WAS SOME SORT OF ELECTRICAL SHORT THAT WAS SLOWLY SIMMERING FOR HOURS. THE CAR HAD ONLY BEEN DRIVEN HOME (20 MILE TRIP) AND PARKED. THE FIRE OCCURRED  8 HOURS LATER. THERE WAS NOTHING FLAMMABLE AROUND THE CAR. I FULLY BELIEVE THE CAR SELF IGNITED DURING THE EVE. I CALLED NISSAN TO REPORT THIS BEFORE I EVEN CALLED MY INSURANCE AGENT. I ASKED FOR AN INVESTIGATION. IF THIS CAR HAD BEEN PARKED IN THE GARAGE I COULD HAVE ALSO LOST MY HOME AND MY FAMILY. I DOUBT THIS IS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT, AND I FEAR OTHERS MY NOT BE SO FORTUNATE AS TO LOOSE ONLY THE CAR AND NO OTHER DAMAGES. THE CAR HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY AND IS TO BE INVESTIGATED MARCH 23,2018. *TT
THIS IS NOT A FAILURE AT THIS TIME BUT MORE OF A SAFETY CONCERN.  THE WINDSHIELD OF OUR ROGUE 'CONCAVE' IS THE AREA AROUND THE REARVIEW MIRROR (THIS CAN BE SEEN IN THE ATTACHED PHOTO - NOTE THE DISTORTION OF THE REFLECTED IMAGE OF THE TREES WITHIN BLUE CIRCLE). WHEN YOU PRESS ON THE INSIDE OF THE GLASS THAT DISTORTED AREA SLIGHT 'FLEXES' - SUGGEST A WEAK POINT IN THE GLASS.  I HAVE VIDEO CAN EMAIL BUT TOO LARGE TO ATTACHED HEREIN.  DEALER / NISSAN SAYS THIS IS NORMAL - I SAY ITS A 'FAILURE WAITING TO HAPPEN'.  I HAVE LOOK AT OTHER SIMILAR ROGUES AND DO NOT FIND THE SAME ISSUE AS NOTED HERE.  THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR RESPONSE.     I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE: THE DASHBOARD OF THIS CAR ILLUMINATES  ALONG WITH DAY TIME DRIVING LIGHTS WHEN ENGINE IS STARTED.  HERE IS THE PROBLEM WITH THIS - IN THE EVENING THE LITE DASH GIVES THE DRIVER THE IMPRESSION 'ALL LIGHTS ARE ON' - AND YES THE DAY TIME LIGHTS ARE BRIGHT ENOUGH TO DRIVE AT NITE - BUT ALL THE TAIL LIGHTS / MAIN HEAD LIGHTS ARE OFF. TO PROVE THIS AS A POTENTIAL PROBLEM - SO FAR I HAVE SEEN 3 ROGUES DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY WITH NO TAIL / HEAD LIGHTS !

MY NISSAN ROGUE HAS A VIBRATION ISSUE THAT IS NOTICEABLE WHEN THE CAR IS RESTING AT A RED LIGHT, AND WHILE DRIVING. YOU CAN SEE THE PASSENGER CHAIR VIBRATING AND THE DASHBARD IS NOTICEABLE WHEN MY GPS UNIT IS MOUNTED ONTO IT. I TOOK IT TO BAYRIDGE NISSAN INC, IN BROOKLYN, NY -THIS IS THE DEALER THAT I PURCHASED ROGUE FROM , DON'T KNOW IF THIS PROBLEM IS A SAFETY DEFECT . DEALERSHIP SAYS NO FIX FOR IT.
A component in my Transmission failed. I hooked it up to a code reader and it is saying its a solenoid. My car did not experience any warning signs or trouble. It just out if no where decided it wont go into reverse and move and it wont move in drive either. It did this and then after the engine made a noise the check engine light turned on. It is now at a repair shop being looked at. Again this happened out of the blue with no warning signs. I also have only had the car for one year.
Have a 2016 Nissan rogue with about 49,000 miles. About two months ago, started experiencing judder when truck got above 50 miles an hour. Took it to a local mechanic where they performed a diagnostic and let us know there was a transmission problem. They advised to speak to the Nissan head office directly  because there was a known transmission  issue for that particular year, make and model. On 11/12/2024,  called Nissan USA, spoke to Ashley in their consumer affairs department where a claim was opened. Ashley took  information on the truck and based on the mileage said there was a possibility of a goodwill being offered. The truck had to be taken to one of Nissan’s  service locations to have a diagnostics performed which was done on 11/20/2024. Once done and $200 later, Nissan confirmed that the transmission had to be replaced for about $8000.  Consumer affairs received the diagnostic report and made the decision that despite the low mileage, they could not extend the warranty as a courtesy to us.  I find it unfair that I have a vehicle that was drivable a few weeks ago, and with no fair warning, started having the same transmission  problems that Nissan was sued for and settled for the same make and model.  Please help me find some justice. Thank you.
The contact owns a 2016 Nissan Rogue. The contact received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 22V024000 (Electrical System). The vehicle was taken to the dealer for the recall repair, and the dealer only applied white lithium grease to the electrical connectors. The contact stated that the dealer refused to replace the wiring harness connector and informed the contact that it was not necessary. The contact stated that after the recall repair was performed, the vehicle failed to start. The contact replaced the battery. The vehicle later lost motive power while driving. The contact pushed the vehicle to the side of the road, and the vehicle was towed to an independent mechanic, who replaced the alternator; however, the failure recurred. The vehicle was taken back to the independent mechanic, who diagnosed that the ABS wiring harness, ABS control module, and wheel speed sensor needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure and a case was opened. The failure mileage was approximately 51,000.
While driving home from work, the vehicle's transmission stopped working, resulting in coasting out of traffic and requiring a tow home at night. My safety and the safety of others were at risk. The next morning, the vehicle was towed to the mechanic shop, which confirmed the transmission failed and needs a complete replacement. There was not any warning lights or clear symptoms. In hindsight, there were some slight performance warnings that began about 2 miles prior to failure. The vehicle had a slight hesitation (like driving a car that wasn't warmed up prior to the 1990s or using cheap gas) but it was so slight and not alarming or cause for concern. The following day I was scheduled to drive to San Fransisco, had the failure occurred on I-80, it would have been a dangerous situation. Another safety issue is the radio screen that doesn't work when the outside temperature is hot, it flashes so bright, and it is so distracting that I put a postcard in front of it to dim the strobe effect. The dealership said I need to replace the computer but it was safe to drive.  This vehicle has been well maintained and has approx 121k miles. The link to the repair estimate from the mechanic stopped working after I declined the $9000 cost. So I cannot provide that. The vehicle was towed back to my home, and it is parked in my driveway until I figure out what to do.
During highway driving speeds vehicle will suddenly lose power and slow down. Pressing accelerator pedal increases RPM but not the speed. With cruise control engaged vehicle will suddenly and abruptly slow down with RPMs climbing to 4000.  I fear that I will be hit from behind because of suddenly slowing down.  Also unable to pass vehicles due to loss of power.

Power windows don’t work , have issues with my abs causing car not to kick into gear sometimes, battery replacement
We've owned this Nissan Rogue since since we bought it around 6,000 miles.  I've maintained it and driven it almost completely all highway miles as we live in a rural area.  Required maintenance schedule was followed and CVT transmission service was done at a Nissan Dealer. Without warning, the car lost acceleration/power in the middle of the highway as we were driving into town to take my son to baseball practice.  We were nearly in a major accident as we could not accelerate.  The engine kept revving as we put the pedal to the floor but would not move faster. Bringing it to the nearest dealership less than a mile away, he inspected it and informed us that the transmission would need to be replaced.  Their little dealership had already done "over 70 of these" as Nissan "had a known problem with their CVT transmission."  According to him it was poorly designed and they knew it.  They had remedied some of the problems  in the new/rebuilt transmission that could replace it, but refused to issue a recall for the defective transmissions.  Cost to repair:  more than $5,000! We could have been seriously injured or killed!  This is a huge safety hazard that Nissan absolutely knows about and refuses to fix.

CVT TRANSMISSION APPEARED ABNORMAL NOISE&#65292;WHEN DRIVING AT HIGH SPEED, THERE IS A NOISE; AT LOW SPEEDS, THERE IS A SCRATCHING SOUND
WAS DRIVING CAR AND TRANSMISSION DIED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED TO REPAIR SHOP AND NEEDS A NEW TRANSMISSION. NISSAN ONLY COVERS UP TO 60000 MILES AND I AM OVER THAT SO IF IS COSTING ME $5000 TO REPLACE IT
2016 NISSAN ROGUE, 84, 000 MILES.  VEHICLE BEGAN HAVING TROUBLE SHIFTING GEARS WHILE DRIVING IT.  SHUDDERING AND JERKING.  RPM'S FLUCTUATING ALL OVER THE TACH.  CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  I TOOL IT TO MY MECHANIC TO PULL THE CODES, WHICH THEY DID, AND THEY REFERRED ME TO THE DEALERSHIP.  ON MY WAY HOME, DURING WHICH THE VEHICLE COULD GO NO MORE THAN 25 MILES AN HOUR, IT COMPLETELY LOST POWER ON A SMALL INCLINE.  REVERSE AND DRIVE DID NOT WORK.  I HAD TO HAVE SOMEONE PUSH THE CAR BACK OUT OF THE INTERSECTION IT WAS STUCK IN.  I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED.  PROBLEM IS THE CVT TRANSMISSION.
AT ABOUT 58000 MILES SEPT 2019 I FIRST NOTICED ISSUES WITH ACCELERATION AND NOISE.  I WAS ABOUT TO GO OUT OF TOWN AND WAS AFRAID TO GET ON THE HIGHWAY.  I TOOK MY CAR TO NISSAN OF BOWIE.  THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE SAID THERE WERE NO CODES ACTIVATED AND NO RECALLS ON THE CAR.  HE GAVE ME A LIST OF OTHER CONCERNS FOR MY CAR (BRAKES, ROTORS, AND TIRES). I LEFT THE DEALERSHIP AND DID NOT DRIVE OUT OF TOWN AS PLANNED.  MY HUSBAND REPLACED MY ROTORS, BRAKES, AND TIRES. STILL THE CAR WAS SHAKY.  NEXT TRIP OUT OF TOWN WAS IN MAY 2020.  MY CAR STALLED OUT WHILE WE WERE ON THE HIGHWAY TO VISIT MY FAMILY IN KENTUCKY.  WE WERE AN HOUR AWAY FROM OUR HOTEL AND DROVE EXTREMELY SLOW. NO DEALERSHIPS WERE OPEN ON SUNDAY. WE TOOK MY CAR TO COYLE NISSAN IN SOUTHERN INDIANA. THIS TIME THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON.  THEY EXPLAINED THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS COMPLETELY TRASHED AND OUT OF WARRANTY.  I TRIED TO SEE IF MY INSURANCE COMPANY WOULD COVER IT.  A SERVICE TECHNICIAN AT THIS LOCATION TOLD MY INSURANCE COMPANY THERE IS NOTHING I COULD HAVE DONE TO DAMAGE THE TRANSMISSION.  IT GOES OUT ON ITS OWN. THE CVT TRANSMISSIONS HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM FOR YEARS. I CALLED THE NISSAN WARRANTY PEOPLE TO GET SUPPORT. THEY AGREED TO PAY PARTS AND NOT LABOR. WHILE I WAS STRANDED OUT OF TOWN AND STUCK IN A HOTEL, I HAD TO PAY 2000 DOLLARS FOR LABOR TO GET BACK ON THE ROAD AND RETURN TO MARYLAND. I FILED A BBB AUTOLINE COMPLAINT AND THEY SAID THEY ONLY HELP WITH CARS LESS THAN 3 YEARS OLD.  MY SECOND TRANSMISSION WAS PUT IN ON MAY 14TH AND WENT OUT LESS THAN TWO WEEKS LATER ON MAY 27TH. I NOTICED ISSUES THIS TIME AS SOON AS WE HEADED TO MARYLAND.  IT STALLED OUT COMPLETELY WHILE I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY AGAIN.  THIS CAR IS NOT SAFE.  I AM STILL MAKING PAYMENTS ON THIS CAR AND AM ON A THIRD TRANSMISSION.  THERE WAS A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST NISSAN FOR THE EXACT TRANSMISSION IN 2019 ON OTHER MODELS.  *TR
I WAS MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN WHEN ANOTHER DRIVER HIT ME. MY ENTIRE FRONT END IS DESTROYED AND THE AIRBAGS NEVER DEPLOYED. MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH SUFFERED HEAD INJURIES DUE TO THE AIRBAGS NOT DEPLOYING.
MY PASSENGER SIDE AIR BAG LIGHT TURNS ON EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A PASSENGER OR NOT IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. I COULD BE DRIVING ALONE AND IT IS TURNING ON AND OFF.
LAST YEAR I WAS REARENDED WHILE WAITING TO MAKE A LEFT HAND TURN AND MY AIRBAG DIDN'T DEPLOY. THE IMPACT OF THE ACCIDENT WAS HARD ENOUGH THAT MY L-5 VERTEBRAE WAS BROKEN AND DISPLACED A CENTIMETER AWAY FROM SEVERING MY SPINAL CORD. IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME UNTIL MY DEPOSITION AND THE LAWYERS WERE ASKING ME WHY THE AIRBAG DIDN'T DEPLOY THAT THERE COULD BE A PROBLEM. I WAS SITTING STATIONARY ON HWY 80 E IN STATESBORO GEORGIA WAITING TO MAKE A LEFT TURN INTO BABCOCK AND MORE HOME FURNISHINGS WHEN I WAS STRUCK FROM BEHIND. THERE IS NO TURN LANE IT'S A 4 LANE HIGHWAY AND I WAS IN THE LEFT LANE WITH MY TURN SIGNAL IN.
OUR 2016 NISSAN ROGUE WAS STOPPED AT AN INTERSECTION AT 6:30 A.M. ON A CITY ROADWAY WHEN WE HEARD A LOUD POPPING NOISE AND THE SOUND OF BREAKING GLASS.

WE CHECKED THE SURROUNDING AREA AND COULD NOT FIND ANY OBJECT THAT COULD HAVE STRUCK THE VEHICLE, OR PEOPLE. AS SEEN IN THE PHOTOS, THE GLASS WAS BROKEN OUTWARDS FROM THE CAR. THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR, AND VISIBILITY WAS GOOD.

The contact owns a 2017 Nissan Rogue. The contact stated that while depressing the accelerator pedal, the vehicle failed to respond as intended, and the vehicle hesitated and stalled. Additionally, the contact stated that the vehicle independently stopped while depressing the accelerator pedal, and an independent mechanic was contacted. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic to be diagnosed and the contact was informed that the transmission needed to be replaced. The contact stated that the failure had occurred twice. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was notified on the failure and informed the contact to call Toyota for assistance. The contact called Toyota and was informed that the dealer where the vehicle was purchased was out of business and to call Nissan for assistance; however, the contact received no assistance. The approximate failure mileage was 133,000.
Car had scheduled routine maintenance done on February 15, 2025 where tires were rotated and balanced. About a month later, the rear differential failed. Car only has 87,000 miles on it and was not driven in any excessive manner. Wheel bearings made noise for two days and then the differential failed before car was able to be seen by the repair shop. This is an example of a critical flaw in the differential and is extremely dangerous because it could have seized up while I was driving my daughter to preschool. Vehicle has inspection report from two different repair shops (one being the dealer) confirming failure of rear differential. No warning lamps, messages, or othe symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, only two days of noisy wheel bearings indicating they needed replacement.   Nissan issued service bulletin NTB10-0291 regarding this problem but no recall has been ordered. When can I expect a recall?
There’s a problem with the transmission.  The car was not accelerating so my mechanic looked at it and determined it need a new transmission.  The car only has 81,300 miles on it.
Key wouldn't start the car. It was in lock mode. Had to get it repaired.  I had issues with the stario before where it went blank and nonsound will come out. Got it fixed, how, there are times where it comes and goes.
I have water leak and mold growing in the passenger side of the vehicle for about a month. I took car to Rockaway Nissan, where i bought the vehicle. The dealer Stated that, they found sunroof drain hoses clogged with water and debris causing back flow of water into cabin which they claimed cleared and tested for leak and should remedy the issue. Unfortunately, i am still having the leak even after the work they did. I took my car to get inspected and check for leak again. Now they are saying that they don't know where the water is coming from and they advised me that it is safety hazard to drive this car and advised me to call Nissan Corporate office directly. I called Nissan Consumers affairs, and they are saying that it is the dealer that is supposed to fix not them.  am worried that driving this car can create fire and other safety hazard with all this water leaking. Thank You
Check engine light P0776 Pressure control sol B. Recommend replace CVT unit due to internal failure.  Mileage: 109,422 This vehicle was covered by the extended warranty to 84 months or 84,000 miles.  It failed at 109.422 miles.  This is shocking and unacceptable and expensive!   Approximately $6,000 to repair/replace transmission which made the vehicle more costly than its trade in value. Repair estimate performed by South Austin Nissan.   Contacted manufacturer and was referred to the Kbb class action website for information.
My mother and I opened the trunk to place a luggage inside, when a part of the rear hatch detached and hit us as it fell. The piece is plastic and has no warning sensors.
Driving at speed the car brake by itself. There was no cars anywhere near me. It has happened multiple times
Passenger air bag light is on. Took to my local dealership for an oil change and for them to look/fix the  warning light or air bag for the passenger side front seat bag. Told them I have mentioned the light coming on and off when my car was under warranty in the past. Was told by Nissan service person that they have no record of problem. They wanted over $600 for oil change, and fixing warning light (plus they said I needed all the fluids in my car changed). We don't have $600 plus for problem that should be fixed by Nissan. We left and did not have repairs done. I am worried that  air bag won't deploy if there is an accident.
While having my car on for an extended period of time, my car will randomly not accelerate when I push on the gas pedal. As soon as I turn the car off and turn it back on, my car will reset itself and will resume as normal, until it happens again sometimes just 30 minutes later. This issue has happened since I have purchased the car.  This happens mostly when I am in stop and go traffic, when I need to accelerate at a stop light, or even just in a pick up line for my son’s school. I took my car into the Tim Dahle Nissan Dealership in South Jordan, UT and they claimed my transmission issue was not related to the issues mentioned in the complaints and that there are leaks causing it, however, everything lines up exactly with the issues as described and I have never heard of these leaks happening until the visit that I happened to ask for a warranty fix. The last time this complaint happened was back in 2021 where they updated the software on the transmission, they told me this would fix the issue and it did not resolve the issue at all, as if still continues to happen.  I submitted a complaint to Nissan in February this year advising of the same issue happening and I received a letter in the mail stating that this was an issue that would be covered under the warranty.  Please help me get this fixed!!!
Air Conditioner stops working on long drives roughly 45 minutes in.  Cold air does not always come through the vents to the interior.  You can hear the blower working, and the compressor working, but the air flow is very weak, even warm.
When I drive the 2017 Nissan Rogue the acceleration is very slow and no responsive. It's dangerous as I cannot even maintain speed of normal speed limits. I have had fuel injection service and oil change but it made no difference. There are times you could floor the pedal but there is incredible hesitation and knocks.
Car died, now warning light came on malfunctioning of EBS. Cruise control cuts off for no reason. Car breaks on it on. Almost causing accident. It is now in the shop for a brand new transmission!!! And EBS bad sensors. I do not want the car back. Please make them but it back. Also there is a bad ground when using the Bluetooth, but they can’t seem to notice it.
The contact owns a 2017 Nissan Rogue. The contact stated while driving 55 mph, the sunroof exploded, and the sunroof glass shattered onto the shade guard. The contact was able to pull to the side of the road, where he checked the vehicle but could not determine the cause of the failure. The contact then drove to his destination. The vehicle was not diagnosed nor repaired. Neither the manufacturer nor the dealer was made aware of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 55,000.
ENTERING INTO A PARKING STRUCTURE, COMING UP AN INCLINE. I HEAR A BEEP, AND WARING LIGHT COMES ON BUT DISAPPEARS VERY QUICKLY, I'M NOT ABLE TO SEE THE ICON. WHILE COMING UP THE INCLINE AND GETTING READY TO MAKE A RIGHT, THE DASHBOARD BEEPS AGAIN AND THE ICON APPEARS AND DISAPPEARED. THE CAR SUDDENLY JUST BRAKES, COMPLETELY STOPS AND YOU CAN HEAR SKID SOUNDS. THE CAR DOESN'T CUT OFF, BUT TAKES A MINUTE FOR ME TO GET THE CAR BACK IN MOTION.
WHEN THE VEHICLE IS PUT IN DRIVE OR REVERSE THE WHOLE VEHICLE SHAKES TREMENDOUSLY AND IS VERY, VERY NOTICEABLE WHILE HOLDING THE BRAKE.  ALSO WHEN I TURN ON THE AC THE WHOLE VEHICLE SHAKES.
VEHICLE AUTOMATICALLY BRAKES WHILE DRIVING ON BUSY STREET. THERE WAS NOTHING AROUND THE VEHICLE FOR IT TO BE DOING THAT. I WAS PULLING IN MY GARAGE WHEN IT HAPPENED A 2ND TIME.  *TR

ON TUESDAY, AUG. 27, I DROVE MY ROGUE FROM MY JOB AT THE TIMES-TRIBUNE NEWSPAPER IN SCRANTON, PA ON INTERSTATE 84 EAST TO VISIT MY BROTHER IN BREWSTER N.Y. AFTER I EXITED THE INTERSTATE AND HEADED TOWARD MY BROTHER'S HOUSE, MY ROGUE JUST STOPPED WHILE I WAS DRIVING. THE STOP WAS SHORT, AND LUCKILY THE CAR BEHIND ME WAS NOT THAT CLOSE. MY ROGUE THEN CONTINUED TO DRIVE. THERE WAS NOTHING IN FRONT OF ME OR ON THE SIDES TO CAUSE THE AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING TO ACTIVATE LIKE THIS. I WAS DRIVING STRAIGHT ON A CITY ROAD. I DID CROSS RAILROAD TRACKS AND IT HAPPENED RIGHT AFTER THAT.. AT THE TIME, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK. I THOUGHT MAYBE THERE WAS SOME KIND OF ELECTRICAL ISSUE. I DIDN'T BRING IT IN BECAUSE IT DROVE FINE AFTER THAT AND DIDN'T RECUR. SINCE THEN, MY ROGUE HAS DRIVEN NORMALLY.  IT WASN'T UNTIL YESTERDAY WHEN I SAW ALL THE ARTICLES ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THEIR ROGUE'S AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING STOPPING - JUST LIKE MINE DID - THAT I REALIZED THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IN MY ROGUE. I AM SCARED THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN WHILE I'M DRIVING MY CAR AND CAUSE ME TO GET IN AN ACCIDENT. I HAVE NO OTHER MODE OF TRANSPORTATION AND MUST GET TO WORK. MY DAILY COMMUTE IS 45 MINUTES TO AN HOUR EACH WAY.  I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS ISSUE. I CANNOT FIND ANY INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO GET THIS FIXED, AND FRANKLY, I CANNOT AFFORD AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR ON SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING. I ALSO CANNOT AFFORD TO GET A RENTAL CAR WHILE MY ROGUE GETS FIXED.
THE AUTOMATIC BRAKING SYSTEM DEPLOYS AT RANDOM RESULTING IN NEAR REAR END COLLISIONS.  THE CAR HAS BRAKED FORCIBLY WHEN DRIVING OVER SPEED BUMPS, METAL PLATES ON THE ROAD, AND RAILROAD TRACKS.  THE DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT WON'T REPLACE THE DETECTION SYSTEM SAYING THAT CAN'T "RECREATE" THE PROBLEM.  IT CAN'T BE DISABLED PERMANENTLY.  PLEASE INSIST ON A RECALL.  THIS IS SO DANGEROUS!  OWNERS SHOULD BE WARNED TO TURN IT OFF MANUALLY EVERY TIME THEY ENTER THEIR CARS.

I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE WITH 73 MILES ON IT, IT NOW HAS 10,700. MY MAIN COMPLAINT IS REGARDING THE HYBRID/GAS TRANSITION WHEN DRIVING. MY SECONDARY COMPLAINT IS HOW THE VEHICLE DRIVES WHILE IN REVERSE.  THE FIRST COMPLAINT, I THINK, MAKES THIS VEHICLE UNSAFE IN A LOT OF DRIVING SITUATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, TO LEAVE MY NEIGHBORHOOD I HAVE TO MAKE A LEFT TURN ONTO A ROAD WITH A BLIND CORNER.  WHEN I AM READY TO GO, I PUT MY FOOT ON THE ACCELERATOR AND SOMETIMES THE VEHICLE REACTS AS I EXPECT AND MAKES THE TURN NO PROBLEM. HOWEVER, ABOUT 75% OF THE TIME, I HIT THE GAS AND THE CAR IDLES FORWARD INTO THE OPPOSING LANE AND ABOUT 1-1.5 SECONDS LATER THE ENGINE CATCHES UP AND ACCELERATES AS EXPECTED. I'VE COME CLOSE TO BEING TBONED IN JUST THIS INTERSECTION AT LEAST 4 TIMES BECAUSE OF THAT DELAY.  ADDITIONALLY, WHILE DRIVING IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC THE CAR WILL OCCASIONALLY LEAP AHEAD NO MATTER IF I'M PRESSING THE GAS OR THE BRAKE. THE INTERFACE BETWEEN GAS AND HYBRID ON THIS VEHICLE IS HORRIBLE, AND NOT LIKE THE ONE I TEST DROVE BEFORE THIS ONE WAS DELIVERED. I FEEL THIS VEHICLE IS SO UNSAFE THAT I DON'T LET MY 16 YEAR OLD DRIVE IT BECAUSE THE DRIVER ALWAYS HAS TO BE ON THEIR TOES FOR THESE ISSUES. I'VE TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO ADVANTAGE NISSAN IN BREMERTON, WA TWICE OVER THESE ISSUES AND THEY TELL ME IT'S OPERATING WITHIN NORMAL RANGE AND THIS IS NORMAL. NORMAL OR NOT, ITS UNSAFE. I CAN PROVIDE MANY MORE EXAMPLES OF THIS BEHAVIOR FROM THE VEHICLE, JUST CONTACT ME!  THE SECONDARY ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH HOW THE VEHICLE ACTS WHILE IN REVERSE. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT EXACTLY, BUT WHEN REVERSING AT ANY SPEED THE RIDE IS VERY JERKY, LIKE A PERSON REVERSING IN A MANUAL TRANSMISSION THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE HANG OF THE CLUTCH YET. IT'S WORSE WHEN BACKING DOWN MY STEEP DRIVEWAY, POSSIBLY DUE TO THE HILL ASSIST FEATURE!  PLEASE FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.
"TAKATA RECALL"  JUNE 24, 2018, I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY DRIVING AND STRUCK ON THE RIMS OF THE 2017 NISSAN ROGUE SI. AWD BY A PASSING TRUCK. BOTH FRONT AND REAR RIMS ON THE PASSENGER'S SIDE, WHERE MY DOG WAS SEATED.  THE AIR BAGS DEPLOYED ALMOST CAUSING A COLLISION. THE VEHICLE, AND TIRES WAS NOT DAMAGED AT ALL. THE POLICE WAS CALLED AND FOUND IT REMARKABLE THIS VEHICLE AIRBAGS DEPLOYED FROM THE RIMS BEING SCRAPPED.
WAS DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AT 55MPH WHEN I HEARD A LOUD EXPLOSION LIKE A BOMB WENT OFF. I COULD THEN HEAR AIR BLOWING THROUGH THE CAR. I PULLED OFF THE HIGHWAY ONLY TO REALIZE THE SUNROOF, WHICH HAD BEEN CLOSED, HAD COMPLETELY EXPLODED. THERE WERE NO OTHER VEHICLES AROUND ME AT THE TIME AND WAS TRAVELING ON AN OPEN STRETCH OF HIGHWAY WITH NO OVERPASSES YET THE HOLE ON THE SUNROOF LOOKED LIKE A CRATER DROPPED FROM THE SKY THROUGH IT. THANKFULLY I HAD THE SHADE CLOSED OR THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.
VEHICLE RANDOMLY ACCELERATES WEIRD. WHEN TRYING TO ACCELERATE FROM A STOP SIGN OR TRAFFIC LIGHT, IT GOES TO 20 MPH AND HESITATES WITH GAS PEDAL PUSHED. THE RPMS REV UP TO 4,000-5,000 RPM, BUT THE CAR DOES NOT ACCELERATE BEYOND 20 MPH. AFTER ABOUT 10-15 SECONDS, VEHICLE WILL ACCELERATE TO NORMAL SPEED. THIS CAUSES ME TO SIT IDLE AT TIMES FEARING FOR MY SAFETY. NISSAN SERVICE CANNOT GET ANY FAULT CODES TO TRIP OR FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. THE SERVICE MANAGER SAYS IT IS MY SPOUSE AND I'S DRIVING HABITS; HOWEVER, THE GENERAL MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP SAYS IT IS THE TRANSMISSION. NISSAN REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING FURTHER WITH THIS AND MY SAFETY IS AT RISK BASED ON THE UNKNOWN TIMING OF THIS EVENT. DOES NOT HAPPEN AT A CERTAIN TIME OF DAY EXCEPT RANDOMLY. NISSAN IS AWARE OF ALL OF THE DATES/TIMES/LOCATIONS IT HAS HAPPENED SINCE JANUARY 1, 2018.
THE VEHICLE STARTED SHAKING/VIBRATING HEAVILY WHEN SITTING IN TRAFFIC ON A BUSY HIGHWAY JUST THREE WEEKS AFTER PURCHASE WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT GOING ON THE SAME DAY.  IT CONTINUE TO HAVE THUMP/SHAKE/VIBRATION WHEN IDLING (PARKED OR STOP LIGHT) AND GOING AT REDUCED SPEEDS (ROLLING OFF THE GAS PEDAL WHEN PARKING OR IN HEAVY TRAFFIC) AFTER MULTIPLE VISITS TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THE VIBRATION SEEMS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A CONTINUOUS SUDDEN DIP IN THE RPM AS IT DIPS AND GOES BACK TO TO WHERE IT WAS.  THE DEALERSHIP HAS ADJUSTED THE RPM SETTINGS MULTIPLE TIMES AND THE ISSUE SHIFTS FROM VIBRATION TO THUMPING BUT DOES NOT DISAPPEAR, CLEARLY NOT RESOLVING THE ROOT CAUSE.  CURRENTLY, I'VE OWNED THE VEHICLE FOR 3 MONTHS AND BELIEVE THERE WILL BE A RECALL FOR SOMETHING IN THE NEAR FUTURE AS A NEW CAR SHOULD NOT HAVE THESE SORT OF ISSUES OUT OF THE GATE.     TIMELINE:   PURCHASED:  8/7/2017  CHECK ENGINE LIGHT TURN ON:  8/31/17  1ST DEALERSHIP VISIT: 9/1 (FOUND DTC FOR P0300 BUT COULD NOT REPLICATE ISSUE AND CHANGED NOTHING)  2ND VISIT: 10/2:  READJUSTED IDLE SPEED AS PER BULL # NTB15-048A   3RD VISIT: 10/21: INCREASED IDLE TO 670   VEHICLE NOW OPERATES WITH LESS POWER AND RPM STILL DIPS AND SURGES (LESS FREQUENTLY BUT STILL OCCURS)  CONTACTED NISSAN FOR REPLACEMENT OR RE-PURCHASE AND WAS DENIED PER DEALERSHIP COMMENTS.  THEY RECOMMENDED I TAKE TO A DIFFERENT DEALERSHIP  4TH VISIT:  10/28:  COULD NOT REPLICATE, NO CHANGES MADE     AT THIS POINT, I AM REACHING OUT TO YOU AND BBB.  I BOUGHT THIS CAR WITH THE FULL INTENTION OF KEEPING FOR 10+ YEARS, BUT FEEL UNSAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING I LIVE IN THE NYC TRI STATE AREA AND TRAFFIC IS JUST A FACT OF LIFE.
Driver door will not open from outside or inside vehicle.  Based on research this is an acuator issue that Nissan has known about since 2014 & failed to issue a recall.  I am in the process of costly repair @ personal expense for a clear safety issue the know about & have failed to address, & would like reimbursement for.  I have had to climb over/out passenger side several times to enter/exit car, thus far not being trapped, however it is not safe to not be able to quickly exit vehicle.  Nor safe to manuver over console to exit this way.  Nor is it safw not to be able to enter your parked vehicle.  Nissan needs to issue a recall & cover repair expense on all makes/models & all doors affected, checking all 4 doirs, not just the one or 2 doors malfunctioning as this can/will affect all 4 doors.
UNKNOWN...Heater/Blend door on driver's side of the vehicle does not operate. I have had the step motor replaced 9 months ago and now the nylon nut in the heater box is stripped out and the blend door does not operate at all. In looking for repair options I have come across several other owners who also have this same common issue with this vehicle. This is faulty on the manufacturers part and I am asking for a case to be opened to look into this issue.  When I bought the step motor from my local dealership, the parts manager told me that this is a common and large-scale problem with this particular vehicle.

The first time I was just pulling out of my driveway and my car, made this  grinding noise and forced to stop and the braking system light came on. The second time we were going 30 to 45 miles an hour and the same thing happened made that grinding noise came to a stop that time was definitely more harder because we’re going faster. I brought this to the attention of Nissan in Bayshore, and supposedly they checked a couple of things and said nope everything’s fine and like I said that was the first time and the second time they said the same exact thing that there could be some thing that triggered it. No I don’t think so. I think that there’s something wrong with the system because things like that just don’t happen both days that this happened to me it was a clear day one was daytime one was night time , so there was nothing near me. Nothing in the way. This could’ve been really serious if I was going faster. I think that they should be addressed because obviously they are not taking it. Seriously you see all of the complaints why is this not being looked into more the second time when we were going faster, and I told Nissan this it actually hurt me , my neck was killing me for a week. This should be taken very seriously because if somebody is driving faster and that happens or if somebody is a new driver and that happens and they can seriously hurt themselves or others because it comes out of nowhere n is very scary.   FYI- I had to put in a fake date of when it happened to move forward on the form. I’m unsure of the two dates but my car was brought into The Nissan dealership in bayshore for the problem n there is documentation there with the dates.
2018 Nissan Rogue SUV:  Hood suddenly flew open while driving about 30-35 mph.  I was able to safely pull over;  although hood and fenders were damaged, I could close the hood and subsequently brought it to a Nissan dealer.  A tech at the dealership identified the problem as a "frozen" (open) hood latch.  I am awaiting an insurance adjuster to inspect the car.  There were no warnings or any symptoms of problems prior to this incident.  Had this happened at faster speeds, or on a multi-lane highway, who knows what consequences could have ensued.
when I am waiting for someone to come out, I listen to music with key in on position and when I try to start the car it will not start.  It makes a sound but won't turn over. I was told it was the battery, I had that replaced and it is still doing the same thing.  I am concerned that if I am out at night, well anytime there is a car issue it concerns me. Please advise what this could be.
My 2018 Nissan Rogue AEB function triggers with no obstacles in view causing the vehicle to slow down creating a safety hazard. This has happened two times in August 2022 and each time I have taken the vehicle to Stone Mountain Nissan. There have been no resolution so far My safety as well as others have been at risk by the sudden slow down and the vehicle coming to a stop which creates a impact hazard from other drivers I am a senior and afraid to drive because of this issue  On august 26 2022 my rogue suddenly slowed then stopped for no reason or obstruction in view The vehicle barely accelerated creating almost be struck by another driver so august 27 2022 I am sitting at Nissan dealer with a fee of 185 for a diagnostic that is unfair This issue calls for a buy back by Nissan or a recall a no customer cost I purchased this vehicle  new

Vehicle failed to accelerate properly on an uphill incline.  It felt as though it was stuck in a lower gear and unable accelerate due to gear change causing engine revving and shuddering.  Very frightening experience which has now occurred twice.

THIS IS AN EXTREME SAFETY ISSUE!  I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED, HAD I BEEN ON THE EXPRESSWAY OR HAD MY DAUGHTER IN THE CAR, AND THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT!  NISSAN SHOULD ABSOLUTELY RECALL THE CARS AFFECTED BY THIS!  NOT JUST ISSUE BULLETINS TO DEALERSHIP'S.  UNACCEPTABLE.  I'M CALLING THE DEALERSHIP TOMORROW, TO FIND OUT WHAT CAN BE DONE.  NOW, I'M AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CAR.

IT DID NOT REOCCUR FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TRIP, APPROXIMATE TOTAL TRIP TIME OF 75-80 MINUTES.  WILL BE RETURNING THIS VEHICLE TO THE DEALER FOR ANOTHER EVALUATION BUT UNSURE IF IN THE FUTURE THIS VEHICLE MIGHT SUDDENLY STOP, ACTIVATING AIR BAGS AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.
SPARATIC FORWARD EMERGENCY BRAKING LIGHT ON WHILE DRIVING AND NO OTHER VEHICLES AROUND.  ALSO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT : STATING OXYGEN SENSOR NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. CAR WAS BOUGHT NEW. IT IS UNDER WARRANTY AND DEALERSHIP IS UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE AND CORRECTLY FIX.
SOUND FROM CVT OR ENGINE COMPARTMENT WHEN VEHICLE IS DECREASING IN SPEED WITH BRAKE DEPRESSED AT ABOUT 5 MILES PER HOUR.  OCCURS ONLY WHEN VEHICLE SPEED IS SLOWING DOWN SIMILAR TO DOWNSHIFT WHEN DECELERATION TO A STOP.
THE BACK UP CAMERA FREEZES UP WHEN BACKING. BOUGHT IT NEW MAY 5, 2018. NISSAN CORP TOLD ME THE HAVE NO FIX FOR IT. THAT IT WAS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE. WAS BACKING UP ,CAR WAS 2 WEEKS OLD AND HIT A TREE. HAD TO PAY TO FIX THE BUMPER. I THEN TOOK IT TO NISSAN . THEY HAD IT FOR 2 WEEK COULD NOT FIX  THE BACK UP CAMERA
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2018 NISSAN ROGUE. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 10 MPH, A GRINDING NOISE WAS HEARD AND WOULD NOT STOP. THERE WERE NO WARNING INDICATORS ILLUMINATED. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME THE FAILURE OCCURRED. THE VEHICLE WAS DRIVEN TO RAMSEY NISSAN (401 NJ-17, UPPER SADDLE RIVER, NJ 07458), BUT THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED OTHER SUGGESTING THAT THE AVOIDANCE CONTROL SYSTEM FAILED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE AND PROVIDED CASE NUMBER: 35221164. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 3,777.
AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING SYSTEM ON MY VEHICLE INITIATES WHEN NOT NEEDED INTERMITTENTLY.  NO VEHICLES, OBJECTS, ITEMS, CURBS, ETC IN VICINITY OR IN FRONT OF VEHICLE.  TOOK VEHICLE TO DEALERSHIP FOR VOLUNTARY AEB UPDATE, PER NOTICE FROM NISSAN, AND DUE TO IT NOT BEING 'ACTIVE' CODE, UPDATE COULD NOT BE PERFORMED.    WAS EXPLAINED TO ME THAT CODE COULD BE SEEN AS HAVING 'POPPED', BUT DUE TO CAR HAVING BEEN TURNED OFF AND THEN TURNED ON PRIOR TO BEING AT DEALERSHIP FOR INSPECTION, THEIR MAINTENANCE PROCESSES PREVENT THE SOFTWARE UPDATE.  IT WAS FURTHER EXPLAINED TO ME THAT ONCE I TURN CAR OFF AFTER THE AEB EVENT, THAT IT IS NO LONGER AN ACTIVE CODE, BUT BECOMES A PASSIVE CODE.    THIS BECOMES AN ISSUE DUE THE VERY NATURE OF REQUIRING AN ACTIVE CODE, AS I WILL ASSUME THAT NOT ALL OWNERS ARE ABLE TO GO DIRECTLY FROM THE AEB ACTIVATION STRAIGHT TO A NISSAN DEALER (I MYSELF HAVE THIS ISSUE AS IT HAS REPEATEDLY HAPPENED TO ME IN THE MORNINGS ON MY WAY TO CAMPUS OR WORK AND AM UNABLE TO TAKE IT TO DEALER WITHOUT HAVING THE CAR TURNED OFF FOR SOME TIME.).   THIS SHOULD BE ELEVATED TO A WARRANTY RECALL REGARDLESS OF ACTIVE CODE OR NOT, AS HAVING A SOFTWARE ISSUE REGARDING A BRAKING SYSTEM SHOULD BE CONSIDERED MORE THAN JUST INCONVENIENT.
CVT.  RPMS RISING AND FALLING WITHOUT DRIVER INPUT, WITHOUT ANY REASON.  THIS IS A MAJOR HAZARD! CAR FAILS TO RESPOND TO GAS PEDAL, CAUSING SERIOUS HAZARDOUS ISSUES ENTERING TRAFFIC. CAR LOSES POWER ON HIGHWAY. THIS IS NOT SAFE!
THE FORWARD COLLISION AVOIDANCE (FCA) / AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING SYSTEM INADVERTENTLY ACTIVATED RESULTING THE BRAKES BEING ABRUPTLY APPLIED WHILE DRIVING FORWARD ON A NEIGHBORHOOD THOROUGHFARE AT 40 MPH AND NOTHING IN FRONT OF ME.. THERE WAS A VEHICLE FOLLOWING ME WHICH HAD TO SWERVE AROUND ME OR ELSE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A REAR COLLISION. THE SYSTEM GENERATED A FALSE WARNING WITH A BEEPING AND DASHBOARD LIGHTS. THIS IS THE 1ST TIME THE VEHICLE HAS APPLIED THE BRAKES IN THE 3 MONTHS I'VE HAD THE VEHICLE.  I HAVE CALLED THE AUTONATION PINECREST DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME TO BRING THE VEHICLE IN TO CHECK THE FCA SENSOR BECAUSE THEY HAVE SIMILAR COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER NEW ROGUE OWNERS.
PURCHASED ROGUE WITH 7 MILES ON IT.  ON DRIVE HOME, THE RADIO/NAVIGATION DISPLAY CONTINUOUSLY RESET ITSELF UNTIL UNIT OVERHEATED AND COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN.  THIS REPEATED ITSELF EVERY DAY UNTIL BROUGHT IT TO DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID IT WAS PROBABLY DUE TO A BAD RADIO UNIT AND WILL REPLACE IT.
ENGINE HESITATES WHEN ACCELERATING WHICH IS DANGEROUS WHEN PULLING INTO TRAFFIC.
1)Backup Camera freezes. I need to pause the car and wait a minute then it will restart. This happens a couple of times a week.  2)Also, there have been several times when going down a hill,  my forward collision warning light and sound goes off and it feels like a light emergency brake is applied. (though the dealer told me that I did not have the automatic emergency braking). This occurs for about 2-3 seconds and then stops on it's own. I have never seen anything in the road that would set this off. This has happened about 4 times within the last 6 months or less.
I was driving and all of a sudden my 2019 Nissan Rogue jerked forward and slowed down in mid traffic. The dashboard lit up with warnings and the vehicle began to idle up over 2 RPM's. Luckily there wasn't much traffic coming, otherwise I would have been in an automobile accident.  It really scared me when that happened.  I had to pull over and get myself together before pulling back out in traffic to get home.
My daughter accidentally turned the car off while driving on the highway today due to the defective key.  Luckily she was able to pull over safely and no harm was done.  I came here to report the issue and saw the recall already in effect.  Thank you for all you do.  You can add this to your list of incidents if you wish.  We now know to bring the key in for a fix.
The contact owns a 2019 Nissan Rogue. The contact stated that the seat belt alarm for the front driver’s and front passenger’s side seat belts failed to notify the driver whenever the seats were occupied but the seat belts were not buckled. The symbol showing that the seat belts needed to be buckled was displayed; however, the warning chime failed to sound as designed. The vehicle was taken to the dealer and the contact was informed that it was normal. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure and suggested that the vehicle be taken to another dealer to be diagnosed. The approximate failure mileage was 40,000.
My AEB engaged suddenly while I was driving about 40-45 mph without any other vehicles in front of me. Thankfully there was not a vehicle behind me. I called the dealership and there are no known recalls on my vehicle. They also informed me this was not something that they knew of as being a problem. I was told to make sure the sensor was clear but they would be unable to determine if there was a problem unless they could reproduce it. I am able to turn off this system, but it turns on automatically each time the car is started so I would have to disengage it each time I start my car. This is a dangerous situation as I drive to work on a busy highway in a metropolitan area with many vehicles on the morning/evening commute. I am concerned this could happen again while I am going much faster with cars behind me and this would potentially lead to a serious collision. My car is up to date on inspection. There were no warning lights on at the time of the incident.
The contact owns a 2019 Nissan Rogue. The contact stated that while reversing out of the driveway, the vehicle abruptly stopped. During the failure there were no objects nearby to cause the Back Over Prevention system to activate. The contact stated that the following day while driving at an undisclosed speed, the Forward Collision Avoidance warning light activated and remained illuminated. The cause of the failure was not determined. The local dealer was notified of the failure. The manufacturer was not contacted. The failure mileage was 58,600.
The first incident occurred in November 2019 with about 5,400 mile on the vehicle. On  a side street College Ave next close to intersection, I experienced a false Automatic Emergency braking and luckily none was right behind me but if they had been I could've definitely been injured.  I took the car in for repair and they reported that they fixed the problem using the solution to a 2017?18 recall.  It happened a second time in April or May  of 2021 on the freeway and I wondered if it was because of the reflective paint on the 15 south San Diego freeway after the onramp at University Ave.  Again, luckily no one was following close behind or I could've been injured but I did not take it in again until a week or so later when it happened a third time in the same place.  The automatic emergency braking system broke hard and I was very shook up, luckily again I avoided an accident but it was a very dangerous situation.  When I took the vehicle in they said the sensor was not working and they assured me they fixed it wouldn't happen again.  Last Tuesday, September 14, 2021, close to the same location of the second and third incident, again, with no cars or objects in front of me the emergency braking system slammed on the brakes in this 4th incident. I was again lucky no one hit me but I did fear for my safety and felt I ran the risk of dying if I drive the car again.  We called Nissan and they said this would qualify for the Lemon Law.  I called and the case number #44716633.  I believe Nissan still hasn't figured out their braking problems in existence since 2017.
MY EMERGENCY AUTOMATIC BRAKING SYSTEM LIGHT KEEPS FLASHING AND THERE ARE NO OTHER VEHICLES AROUND ME. CONTINUES TO FLASH EVERY FEW DAYS, WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF OBJECT AROUND ME.
I WAS DRIVING AT I-80 WESTBOUND FROM COUNCIL BLUFFS TO OMAHA. JUST AFTER ENTERING IN OMAHA MY NISSAN ROGUE SL SUDDENLY SLOWED DOWN ITS SPEED FROM 65MILES TO 40 MILES FOR NO OBVIOUS REASON. I HAD MY PRO PILOT ASSIST FUNCTION ON AT IT SEEMS THAT THE CAR DECIDED FOR NO REASON TO DECREASE THE SPEED AS THERE WAS NO VEHICLE IN THE FRONT OF THE CAR THAT I COULD HAVE SEEN IN MY LANE. I WAS WORRIED AND GOT PANICKED AS THERE WAS A SEMI TRUCK BEHIND ME. I IMMEDIATELY TURNED OFF THE PRO PILOT ASSIST FUNCTION AND ACCELERATED TO AVOID A REAR END COLLISION FROM THE SEMI. MY FAMILY A 1 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND WIFE WERE IN THE SUV WITH ME. I THINK WE COULD HAVE GOT KILLED BY THIS MALFUNCTION OF NISSAN ROGUE. PLEASE DO THE NEEDFUL TO HAVE NISSAN CHECK IT AND TO MAKE SURE IF THIS VEHICLE IS SAFE TO DRIVE.
MY VEHICLE HAS AN INTERMITTENT ISSUE WHERE IT SUDDENLY BRAKES WITHOUT CAUSE. I HAVE BEEN IN FOR FIVE REPAIR ATTEMPTS AND AFTER MY FIFTH ATTEMPT IT STILL BRAKED SUDDENLY AND NOW THERE ARE NEW ISSUES, MOST OF CONCERN WAS WHEN MY STEERING JERKED SUDDENLY TO THE RIGHT WHEN I WAS DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY.
I LEFT MY CAR RUNNING WITH THE TRANSMISSION IN PARK. I WENT INTO MY HOUSE FOR A FEW MINUTES. WHEN I LEFT MY HOUSE I SAW THAT MY CAR WAS ROLLING DOWN THE DRIVEWAY. THE CAR HIT A TREE AND CAME TO A STOP. WHEN I GOT TO THE CAR IT WAS STILL RUNNING AND IN REVERSE GEAR. NO ONE WAS IN THE CAR AT THE TIME. I AM POSITIVE THAT WHEN I LEFT THE CAR IT WAS IN PARK.*DT
THE AEB LIGHT KEEPS COMING ON. SEEMS TO HAPPEN WHEN IT IS COLD OUT.
TL* THE CONTACT'S PARENT OWNS A 2019 NISSAN ROGUE. ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS DRIVEN WITHOUT ANY VEHICLES IN CLOSE PROXIMITY, THE AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING SYSTEM ACTIVATED INDEPENDENTLY. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO HUDSON NISSAN (585 NJ-440, JERSEY CITY, NJ 07305, (201) 345-3775), BUT WAS NOT DIAGNOSED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS CONTACTED AND PROVIDED CASE NUMBER: 37840475. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 10,000.
I PURCHASED A NISSAN ROGUE SV AWD ON JULY 17,2019.  WHILE DRIVING BETWEEN 10-20 MPH I NOTICED THE CAR WOULD SPORADICALLY DECIDE NOT TO ACCELERATE AT ALL . I WOULD FLOOR THE GAS AND THE RPM GAUGE WOULD NOT REGISTER NOR WOULD THE CAR ACCELERATE . THIS ALSO OCCURRED WHILE COASTING THROUGH EZ PASS TOLLS ON THE GARDEN STATE PARKWAY! IMAGINE BEING IN THE LEFT OR MIDDLE LANE AND UNABLE TO ACCELERATE ON HIGHWAYS FROM 20 MPH ! IT ALSO OCCURRED WHILE PULLING ONTO HIGHWAYS AND DRIVING ROUNDABOUTS . NO LIGHTS ON DASHBOARD INDICATE WHAT WAS GOING ON . I CALLED NISSAN ON SEPTEMBER 20,2019 AND TOOK THE EARLIEST APPT SEPTEMBER 23,2019.  I WAS FIRST TOLD THAT AFTER THEY DRIVE MY CAR TEN MILES THEY COULDN'T REPLICATE WHAT OCCURRED SO I COULD TAKE IT HOME . I REFUSED AND SAID THAT WAS UNACCEPTABLE AS THE CAR WAS DANGEROUS. I TOLD THEM TO KEEP IT AND FIND OUT WHAT WAS WRONG. THEY CALLED LATE THAT AFTERNOON AND SAID THEY FOUND I NEEDED A STOP LAMP SWITCH . I WAS TOLD THAT THE CAR 'THOUGHT' I WAS BRAKING AND WOULD NOT LET ME ACCELERATE. I SAID THAT'S DANGEROUS AND OUTRAGEOUS! THEY SAID THE LAME SWITCH HAD INTERMITTENT INTERNAL FAILURE . WHEN I ASKED ( AFTER RESEARCHING IT) THAT THECAR MIGHT NEED TO BE REPROGRAMMED? THEY SAID NO . MY CAR IS BRAND NEW AND UNDER WARRANTY. THIS SITUATION SHOULD NEVER OCCUR IT CAN CAUSE SERIOUS INJURIES TO ALL . PLEASE ISSUE A RECALL REGARDING THIS ! THE CAR WAS GIVENBACK TO ME ON SEPTEMBER 25.2019. I'M WORRIED ABOUT MY SAFETY WHILE DRIVING IT .
TL* THE CONTACT RENTED A 2019 NISSAN ROGUE. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 6 MPH AND MAKING A RIGHT TURN, THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE AXLE FRACTURED. AS A RESULT, THE DRIVER LOST CONTROL OF THE STEERING AND CRASHED INTO A PARKED VEHICLE. THE DRIVER SUSTAINED MUSCLE SPASMS AND AN INJURED BACK. MEDICAL ATTENTION WAS NOT RECEIVED. A POLICE REPORT WAS NOT FILED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED FROM THE SCENE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE LOCAL DEALER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE VIN WAS NOT AVAILABLE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 1,656. *BF*JB
The contact owns a 2020 Nissan Rogue. The contact stated that while the vehicle was parked, the rear passenger’s side occupant was unable to release the seat belt buckle. After an extended attempt to assist, the contact observed that the seat belt continued to tighten and would not release, prompting the contact to cut the seat belt strap. No warning lights were illuminated. The vehicle was not taken to the dealer or an independent mechanic. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was 128,000.
I was traveling down a busy road just before lunch when I heard a beep then my Rogue braked hard. Thankfully nobody was in front of me or behind me at the time. It was scary.

The front censors activated during snow storm triggering the brakes to lock and steering wheel to lock. The car slid 50 yards across 3way stop sign intersection into a house front lawn. The same censors keep coming on all the time thinking that something is in front of car but nothing is there. I have recorded the censors lights on a few times. Nissan an Nissan dealer have told but no one seems to try to fix it. I'm filing a complain with NY State attorney general office. I can't take it anymore.
We have 3 2020 Nissan Rogue SV's in our family.  The rear seat belts do not stay up and are too short.  We have reported this to the dealer, Gainesville Nissan, and all they say is we know it is a problem, but Nissan does not have a fix.  We recently had friends in the car and the rear seatbelt could not be latched because the seat belt catch is too low in the seat to be used.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND SHOULD RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE RECALL BY NISSAN!!!!!!!!!  This has happened since we purchased the car in December of 2019.
JANUARY 8TH MY WIFE BACKED UP THE VEHICLE TO TURN AROUND. WHEN PUT IN DRIVE A TRIANGLE WARNING LIGHT CAME ON AND VEHICLE LOCKED UP REFUSING TO MOVE FORWARD. COULD SHIFT FROM PARK TO DRIVE AND NO CHANGE. VEHICLE BRAKES ACTED LOCKED UP. HAD TO TURN OFF THE VEHICLE FOR 5 MINUTES TO RESET THEM WAS ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. AROUND 50 MILES ON VEHICLE AT THAT TIME. ON JANUARY 12 TH, 13TH AND 15TH DRIVING HOME IN THE DARK THE FORWARD CRASH LIGHT BLINKS FOR 2 TO 3 MINUTES WHEN THE HIGH BEAMS ARE TURNED ON. WEATHER ON THE 12TH AND 13TH WERE CLEAR AND WAS FLURRIES ON THE 15TH. NO OBSTRUCTION OF THE SENSORS ON FRONT OF VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE HAD 60 TO 100 MILES ON IT ON THESES DAYS. DEALERSHIP SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT AND LOOKED AT VEHICLE ON JANUARY 19TH. THE REPORT AND DEALERSHIP SAYS THEY ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS BUT HAVE NO SOLUTIONS TO FIXING THE PROBLEM.
FORWARD EMERGENCY BRAKING SYSTEM, APPLIED HARD BREAKS AT 40MPH,  BRING US TO AN ABRUPT REDUCTION IN SPEED TO 15MPH. THIS HAPPENED DRIVING OVER A RAIL ROAD TRACK THAT IS EMBEDDED IN THE TAR, NO TRAFFIC IN FRONT FOR 1/4 MILE, 9AM FULL SUNLIGHT.  I ALSO NOTICE THE FORWARD EMERGENCY BRAKING WARNING LIGHT COMES ON ERRATICALLY FLASHING FOR DIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME, THIS HAS BEEN ON THE HIGHWAY AND CITY ROADS, IT HAPPENS WITH NO VEHICLES OR ANY OBSTRUCTION IN FRONT OR SIDE OF MY VEHICLE, IT HAPPENS ON OVERCAST DAY OR FULL SUN. A SECOND INCIDENT OCCURRED WHILE I WAS DRIVING AT 50MPH ON A 3 LANE HIGHWAY. I WAS IN THE MIDDLE LANE AND A TRACTOR TRAILER WAS PASSING ON MY RIGHT SIDE, WHEN THE CAB WAS JUST PAST MY HEADLIGHTS, MY NISSAN ROGUE HIT THE BREAKS HARD ENOUGH THAT IT LURCHED US UNSUSPECTINGLY  FORWARD, THIS HAPPENED WHILE I HAD MY FOOT ON THE ACCELERATION PEDDLE.  LASTLY I HAVE NOTICED WHILE USING THE CRUISE CONTROL AND THE VEHICLE IS GOING DOWNHILL, EASING THE ACCELERATOR EVER SO SLIGHTLY THAT THE FORWARD EMERGENCY BREAKING WARNING LIGHT WILL ILLUMINATE, BUT NOT EVERY TIME. I WOULD NOTE I LIVE IN FLORIDA AND WHEN I SAID DOWNHILL, I ONLY MEAN A SLIGHT DECLINE, WE ARE AT SEA LEVEL, FLAT LAND.
Summary of Issue:   While driving my 2021 Nissan Rogue SL using cruise control, a vehicle turned left in front of me. My Rogue beeped, disengaged cruise control, and abruptly lost acceleration without braking. This sudden loss of throttle caused my car to decelerate in the middle of the road during active traffic, nearly resulting in a collision. There were no warning lights or messages, and the issue did not resolve until I manually took control of acceleration.  Safety Concern:   I rely on cruise control regularly, and this unexpected disengagement created a dangerous situation that compromised my ability to safely maintain speed and respond to surrounding traffic. I’m concerned this may be a fault within the adaptive cruise control system or a misinterpretation by the forward-facing sensors.
I was driving. I hit nothing.  My steering traction light comes on,  and the car starts pulling to the right. I go in the shop.  There is a bend in my passenger inner tie rod.  I took it to the dealer.  they keep trying to get me to say I had an accident.  I did not. Now they want to charge me 3500 to replace the whole steering rack because they "can't just purchase the inner tie rod". Which they can.  MANY PEOPLE are having the same problem with their tie rods being faulty on these cars.
Warning popped up that malfunction and forward collision was disabled
After car is in park and idle for 20+ minutes the car begins to smell like fumes. Caused bad migraines and nausea - having to exit the car and leave the doors open for 30 minutes to remove the smell.
Side view mirrors vibrate to the point of distortion making it harder to see vehicles. The problem is in the pedestal mount attached the doors which act like a tuning fork and need to be updated to wider base pedestals to mitigate vibration like other vehicles that have door mounted mirrors. Please help its very dangerous.
Started noticing the difference with the vehicle around 7,000 miles while driving at different speeds traveling to and from work. it did get worse over time and at 17,000 miles it was at the dealer and they stated that no issues were found or present. Vehicle will have excessive sway / bounce and will dip to one side depending what imperfections you will drive over during the trip. I have no idea how they test the vehicles at the dealer as there is an issue with it when stated to the personnel but at the end it seems to be nothing wrong. Does it take an accident to happen with severe injuries nowadays to have them take something serious. As a service technician my self by bouncing the rear bumper downwards it seems very bouncy, indicating bad shocks. If dealer's technician cant seem to see this then i have no words beyond the quality of service people get once they purchase the vehicles.
Went from a parking lot to the street and suddenly SUV wouldn’t accelerate.  Pulled over, turned car off.  Turned back on and put into drive gear and it moved forward.  Car is 6 weeks old (bought 11/8/2022). Two weeks after obtaining the front crash warning light kept flashing. Then it told me it was a warning and not to drive.  Comes on weekly. Then it doesn’t.
I recently filled up my windshield wiper fluid tank to the max.  As I was driving, my visibility was impaired by dirt/dust.  I activated my wipers to clean the front windshield and nothing came out.  I had to pull over on the highway because I had difficulty seeing.  When I opened the front hood to check my fluid level, it was empty.  I used a bottle of water to clean the front windshield.  I purchased another bottle and when I was filling up the wiper fluid tank, it started to come out of the bottom of the vehicle.  I took it to the dealership and was told that it was cracked and needed to be replaced.  They said I must have hit something on the road.  The problem with that is there is no other visible damage underneath the vehicle.   A mechanic told me that he has been seeing numerous Rogues coming in with the same problem: cracked windshield wiper fluid reservoirs.
The cheap plastic transmission drive selector broke off when I took delivery of the rental car. I was astonished to find that the thing just broke and pulled right out of its socket while I was attempting to back it up right out of the rental parking lot. I've driven cars since 1971 and I've never seen a drive selector just break off that easily before. That should just never happen. I never could get it into drive again without just turning the car off. I finally figured out how to get it into Reverse and Drive and Neutral, but that's it. There were no warning lamps and the indicator on the shift lever that's supposed to tell you it's in Park never lit up. Without it going into park, there is a real risk of the car rolling away. Turning the car off does put it into Park because it's an electronic transmission apparently. But I had to engage the parking brake when putting it into Neutral when I went to park. I'm just astonished Nissan would put something this fail prone on the road. The shift control should just never break whether it's a lever, or dial or pushbutton. I am now liable for a $400 repair job. I realize that this was just a cheap rental car, but I strongly feel that it shouldn't have happened. Wouldn't want anyone else to have this issue.
I had just filled up my tank and was leaving the local gas station.  My car would not move.  This was not the result of the gas I just put in it.  Additionally, the electrical display on the dashboard was wreaking havoc.  It told me to put my foot on the break to start my car, even though the car had to be running to have the blue tooth connected and me speaking on the phone with the car door wide open.  Best of all, the assistance button to call for help, wouldn't work because it wouldn't start.    The car has less than 3K miles on it, it had to be towed to the dealership.  Because my car is so new I was told the part is on back order.  They are waiting on a fuel pump in hopes of keeping the car running to find out what is causing the electrical issues.  I waited 30 years to get a new car, and now I am afraid of it.  Looking at the reviews and troubles other have had with theirs is disheartening.
The contact owns a 2022 Nissan Rogue. The contact stated that while her husband was driving 65 MPH, the vehicle started to shake and then experienced a loss of automotive power, with the check engine warning light illuminated. The driver pulled over, and the vehicle was towed to a local dealer to be diagnosed. The contact was informed that the engine was faulty and that there were metal shavings found in the oil pan. The contact was informed that the engine needed to be replaced. The vehicle was repaired. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 57,000.
Back up camera fails to load when car is put in reverse. Nissan is not sure what the cause is but thinks its software and wants $700+ for further diagnostics
3/25/2023 784 miles and 12 days after purchasing the vehicle The throttle got stuck, cruise was on but not activated, was going 100mgh, hit the brakes, slowed the speed, every time I took my foot off the brake, I was doing 90-100mph. I hit the brakes 5-7 times to try to cancel the cruise even though it was was set. It said "Activate" so it was not on.  Then after hitting the brakes repeatedly, I heard a loud kerplunk (metal on metal) sound in the engine behind the brake pedal, and it shut off and drove normally afterwards.   3/30/2023 I accelerated to get on I35 and RPM stuck at 3200 and would not shift in sport mode; I changed to Standard mode and the RPMs dropped to 2000-2100; the engine revved up loud in sport mode. Female Service Manager from Burleson Nissan was in the car at the time of the event.   This has happened 3 more times since owning this vehicle. At the advice of my lemon law attorney, I am reporting them separately.
Engine started misfiring and when stopped at red light the engine began making a knocking noise.
I was caught in a snowstorm, driving about 5 MPH. Suddenly, the vehicle swerved to the left and I lost complete control; the brakes locked up. The vehicle spun about 145° degrees before coming to a stop perpendicular to the road; subsequently rear-ended from behind. The moment was surreal; I’ve never felt closer to a life-threatening incident because I had ZERO CONTROL over the car: I was spared ONLY because there was no oncoming traffic.  My biggest concern is why the safety systems failed to intervene. During the incident, the ABS did NOTHING. Traction Control, NOTHING. NO warning lights came on. It’s mind blowing that the car skidded about 145° degrees without any intervention from the ABS and Traction Control systems. With modern 4-channel ABS and advanced Traction Control (Vehicle Dynamic Control) safety systems, the car should have attempted to correct itself.  Because I was at a standstill, I was braking the entire time; I didn’t jam the brakes or steer the vehicle.  To make matters worse, the car was in Snow Mode AWD. One hypothesis is a glitch where Vehicle Dynamic Control won’t operate in snow mode to give maximum engine performance. But at the cost of reduced safety and traction.  Or perhaps the safety systems are not working as intended. The emergency brake malfunction light occasionally comes on when idling and several malfunction messages once during a long trip. However, these were sporadic and did not appear before this incident.  Moreover, the maintenance person at my apartment recently experienced the same issue. While on the road with his new 2021 Nissan Rogue, his car spun out of control FOUR TIMES. He's driven in the snow in other vehicles without a problem, and will NEVER drive the Rogue in snow again.  Because this vehicle failed in a critical safety scenario, I’m requesting Nissan carefully inspect the safety systems, including the Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) and Vehicle Dynamic Control free of charge. Will escalate this further if needed.
The contact owns a 2022 Nissan Rogue. The contact stated while pulling out of the driveway, the check engine warning light illuminated. Additionally, the vehicle made an abnormal sound while pulling into the driveway later that day. The vehicle was taken to a local Pep Boys, where it was diagnosed that the failure was related to the emission and the fuel system. The vehicle was then taken to the dealer, where it was diagnosed that the fuel pump had failed and needed to be replaced; however, the dealer informed the contact that the parts were on back order. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 3,900.
For roughly the last three months, several times I have smelled fuel or gas in the interior cabin. Mostly at startup for first time during morning.  But also when starting car after use earlier in the day. The smell dissipates after 10 minutes or so. Especially if I roll down windows to let in fresh air. Please let me know how address because dealer will not see issue as it does not occur with a defined pattern that I recognize. I did notice that when the gas tank was near empty the smell was very strong - and I was driving car for several minutes before the odor started. This issue is not healthy for breathing and I’m worried about it getting worse and becoming a safety issue.

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE LOST POWER WHILE BEING OPERATED. THE DEALER WAS NOT CONTACTED. AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC DIAGNOSED THAT THE WIRELESS IGNITION NODE RECEIVER NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS CONTACTED AND STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS EXCLUDED FROM RECALL NUMBER: K08 (WIRELESS IGNITION NODE RECEIVER). THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 80,000.
WHILE DRIVING THE CAR AND BRAKING THE PEDAL WILL DROP ABOUT HALF WAY AND THEN RECOVER TO NORMAL USE. I HAVE OWNED THE CAR FOR ABOUT 4 YEARS AND IT HAS HAPPENED AT LEAST FIVE TIMES STARTLING THE DRIVER. THE  CAR HAS BEEN TO A FEW MECHANICS AND THEY HAVE FOUND NOTHING WRONG. I BELEIVE IT COULD BE RELATED TO THE 2011 RECALL FOR BOOSTERS IN JEEPS.
I CAME OUT OF STORE AND CARE WOULD NOT START. AFTER TRYING FOR 10-15 MINUTES REMOTE START AND KEY START, IT FINALLY STARTED. LAST WEEK APR. 22, THIS HAPPENED AGAIN. I WAS TOLD BY FRIENDS THE PROBLEM WOULD ONLY  GET WORSE.  *TR
I WAS IN THE SERVICE STATION OF THE LOCAL DEALER FOR SOME REPAIR WORK IN ANKARA-TURKEY ON THE 7TH OF NOVEMBER 2013. AFTER COMPLETING THEIR WORK, THE TECHNICIAN BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE OUTSIDE AREA OF THE SERVICE FACILITY TO GIVE THE CAR BACK TO ME. BEFORE GETTING OUT OF THE CAR THE TECHNICIAN HAS PULLED THE HAND BRAKE LEVER AND WE HEARD SOME KIND OF A METAL FRACTURE SOUND. AFTER THAT SOUND THE LEVER SEEMED TO BE NORMAL IN APPEARANCE BUT IT LOST ITS FUNCTIONALITY AT ALL. THE SERVICE PEOPLE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE FRACTURE OF THE CLOCK SPRING ARRANGEMENT OF THE HAND BRAKE MECHANISM. THEY HAVE PROPOSED TO FIX IT OUT OF CHARGE. BUT I DIDN'T GIVE PERMISSION, BECAUSE THE FIXING PROCEDURE REQUIRES THE REMOVAL OF THE DRIVER SEAT AND MAIN INTERIOR CONSOLE OF THE VEHICLE. FROM THAT DATE ON I'M NOT USING MY CAR IF IT IS NOT SO URGENT. TO MY KNOWLEDGE, HAND BRAKE IS NOT ONLY A PARKING BRAKE, IT IS AN EMERGENCY BRAKE AS WELL. TO MY KNOWLEDGE THE HAND BRAKE LEVER HAS TO WITHSTAND TO A PULLING FORCE OF 400 NEWTONS. DURING MY INCIDENT, THE TECHNICIAN DIDN'T PULL THE LEVER WITH AN AGGRESSIVE AND STRONG MANNER. HE PULLED IT WITH A MODERATE PULLING AFFORD.   I WANTED TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE FOR SAKE OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER OWNERS. I THINK IT WORTH A TECHNICAL INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE FRACTURE THRESHOLD VALUE FOR THE HAND BRAKE MECHANISM OF MY VEHICLE. I'M SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THIS KIND OF A PROBLEM MAY BE SYSTEMATICALLY VALID FOR THE REMAINING SERIES OF MY CAR, IF SO IT MAY REQUIRE AN OFFICIAL RECALL. WITH BEST REGARDS.  NOTE: YOU HAVE TO DIAL MY PHONE NUMBER LIKE [XXX]    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR
SEE ATTACHED LETTER DATED 25 MARCH 2010 ( SHOULD READ 25 MARCH 2011)  BRIEFLY SUMMARIZED: THE VEHICLE ENGINE WILL SPEED UP TO BETWEEN 4000 AND 5000 RPM'S FOR NO REASON AND THE ONLY WAY TO GET THIS TO STOP IS TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND SHUT THE ENGINE OFF AND RESTART IT.  THIS HAS HAPPENED NUMEROUS TIMES AND IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED.
The contact owns a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The contact stated that while driving at approximately 70 MPH, it lost automotive power. The contact turned on the hazard lights. The contact was able to pull over to the side of the road. The vehicle stalled but was able to be restarted.  There were no warning lights illuminated. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic, who informed her the vehicle began to shake and the failure was due to the tip-in. The contact stated that while driving at unknown speeds, the service air suspension message was displayed. The front end of the vehicle was sitting on the tires. The local dealer was contacted, but the vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was contacted and referred to the NHTSA hotline. The failure mileage was approximately 55,000.
Greetings, after 3 dealership attempts to correct the TIPM - NHTSA 19V813000 recall, my Jeep still stalled 4 times at highway speeds. I narrowly averted being rearended several times. I am terrified to drive the vehicle! I have yet another dealership appointment Friday, January 12, 2024 to correct the issue. Previous visits could not reproduce the problem or show any code errors. There were no warnings at all during these malfunctions, only the loss of braking and power steering did I realize the vehicle had stalled. Are there any remedies afforded to me at this point from Chrysler? The vehicle has only 124,000 miles. I've been extremely lucky that I haven't crashed or injured another party to date, but I fear it could happen at any time since this is my only transportation to and from work.
My 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee has had an issue with the Total Integrated Power Module since the year I bought the vehicle new from an authorized Jeep dealer.  I have since taken it to Rentschler Chrysler Jeep of Slatington PA multiple time and had the vehicle misdiagnosed (even though I told the service manager that I thought it was the TIPM).  The finally did a re-wiring of the TIPM as per the recall that was eventually initiated.   Since then I have taken my car back multiple times as the issue is not resolved.  My vehicle shuts off when driving multiple times a year.   This has happened at inopportune times such as braking, going down hills, going through intersections and turning.   The re-wiring of the Total Integrated Power Module has not fixed my vehicle and I told the service manager this.  The most recent visit to the dealer resulted in me paying for a crank sensor to be replaced.  This has not fixed the issue, as my vehicle shut off while driving again.  I do not believe the re-wiring of the TIPM has corrected the recall of my vehicle and the service manager said I could buy a new TIPM.  I believe this is wrong and I have spent so much time and money on this vehicle.   This is putting me and my passengers in a dangerous situation every time I drive my car.
TIPM module has gone out around 64000 miles causing throttle, starting and charging issues.
The contact owns a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The contact received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 19V813000 (Electrical System) however, the part to do the recall repair was not yet available. The contact stated that while driving at an undisclosed speed, the vehicle stalled. The dealer was made aware of the failure but informed the contact that parts were not yet available. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 107,000. Parts distribution disconnect.   (RECALL RELATED INCIDENT)  TS

THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE MANUFACTURER HAD EXCEEDED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THE RECALL REPAIR. AN UNKNOWN DEALER WAS CONTACTED AND CONFIRMED THAT PARTS WERE NOT YET AVAILABLE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE ISSUE. THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE. VIN TOOL CONFIRM PARTS NOT AVAILABLE.
FUEL PUMP RELAY ISSUE; NO PARTS HAVE BEEN MADE YET AND MY CAR KEEPS STALLING ON THE ROAD
FOR THE LAST MONTH THE VEHICLE HAS STALLED WHILE DRIVING AND IN SOME CASES WOULD NOT START.  I RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT THERE IS A SAFETY RECALL V62 FUEL PUMP RELAY PROBLEM IN THE MODEL.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL DECEMBER.  I USE THE CAR DAILY AND FOR LONG TRIP AND FEAR IT IS A SAFETY HAZARD.  CHRYSLER RECOMMENDS BRING THE CAR IN FOR A TEMPORARY FIX WHICH IS WORRISOME.
MY VEHICLE HAS RANDOMLY TURNED OFF ON ME TWICE DURING MODERATE TO HEAVY BRAKING.  THE FIRST TIME WAS ON 8/20/2019 AND THE SECOND TIME WAS ON 12/3/2019.  I BELIEVE MY ISSUE IS RELATED TO RECALL V62 AND I AM VOICING MY DISPLEASURE IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT IS TAKING FIAT CHRYSLER TO DESIGN A REMEDY.  THIS RECALL IS ACTUALLY RECALLING A PRIOR RECALL, SO I WOULD SCRUTINIZE THE ENGINEERING TEAM THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY COME UP WITH A SUFFICIENT REMEDY, BUT I SUPPOSE THAT'S NOT MY POINT.  MY POINT IS MY VEHICLE AND OVER 500,000 ADDITIONAL VEHICLES ARE ON THE ROAD WITH A PROBLEM THAT IS EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS WITH NO ETA IN SIGHT. (RECALL RELATED INCIDENT)  TS
MIENTRAS LA GUAGUA SE ENCONTRABA EN MOVIMIENTO COMENZO A FALLAR. ME ESTACIONE Y LA APAGUE Y DESPUES NO PRENDIO. LA LLEVE EN GRUA AL MECANICO Y ME INFORMO QUE ES EL ALTERNADOR. EN MENOS DE DOCE MESES TENGO QUE COMPRAR OTRO ALTERNADOR.    WHILE THE GUAGUA WAS ON THE MOVE, IT BEGAN TO FAIL. I PARK AND TURN IT OFF AND THEN I DON'T TURN IT ON. I'LL TAKE HER IN A CRANE TO THE MECCANIC AND I'LL KNOW SHE'S THE ALTERNATOR. IN LESS THAN TWELVE MONTHS I HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER ALTERNATOR.  *TR
I'VE BEEN HAVING NUMEROUS POSSIBLE SAFETY ISSUES WITH THIS VEHICLE, FOR EXAMPLE : INTERMITTENT STARTING, LOST OF POWER @ HIGHWAY SPEED, PROXIMITY SENSOR GIVING WARNING WHILE DRIVING WITH NO OBSTRUCTION IN PATH, AIR RIDE SYSTEM ADJUST AT RANDOM EVEN WHILE PARKED ECT.  *TR
ON 1/22/20 I SPOKE WITH ASMA AT FCA REGARDING AN ISSUE MY JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE IS HAVING WITH A FUEL RELAY RECALL (NHTSA RECALL NUMBER 19V-813). I INFORMED ASMA THAT MY JEEP HAS STALLED WITHOUT WARNING SEVERAL TIMES WHILE DRIVING- SEVERAL OF THE TIMES WERE WHILE I WAS DRIVING AT HIGH SPEEDS ON THE HIGHWAY. I WAS INFORMED BY ASMA THAT THERE IS NOT A PERMANENT FIX, HOWEVER BECAUSE I WAS EXPERIENCING ISSUES, I COULD TAKE IT TO MY DEALERSHIP FOR A TEMPORARY FIX. ON 1/22/20, I TOOK MY JEEP TO THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THE TEMPORARY FUEL RELAY PART PLACED ON MY VEHICLE. WHILE AT THE DEALERSHIP I WAS WARNED THAT SINCE THE PART IS ONLY A TEMPORARY FIX, THEY COULD NOT ESTIMATE HOW LONG IT WOULD BE BEFORE I EXPERIENCED ISSUES AGAIN. ON SATURDAY, 2/1/20 WHILE MAKING A LEFT TURN MY JEEP ONCE AGAIN STALLED WITHOUT WARNING WHILE IN FRONT OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC. OF NOTE, WHEN THE ENGINE STALLS WHILE DRIVING IT ALSO CAUSING THE POWER STEERING TO GO OUT. SO DURING THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE ON 2/1/20 WHEN THE ENGINE STALLED WITHOUT WARNING WHILE MAKING A LEFT TURN, I WAS FORCED TO DRIVE UP OVER A CURB TO AVOID GETTING HIT DUE TO VEHICLE DECELERATION AND LOSS OF POWER STEERING. ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE A RESULT OF THE FAULTY FUEL RELAY RECALL. I FILED ANOTHER COMPLAINT WITH TASHA AT  FCA RECALL DEPARTMENT ON 2/3/20. PER TASHA, SHE STATES THAT SHE IS GOING TO HAVE A CASE MANAGER REVIEW MY CASE AND CONTACT ME IN 1-3 BUSINESS DAYS. WHEN I QUESTIONED TASHA ABOUT THE SAFTETY OF MY VEHICLE, SHE SUGGESTED THAT I PURCHASE A RENTAL VEHICLE. WHEN I ASKED IF I WOULD BE REIMBURSED BY JEEP AND/OR FCA, SHE STATED THAT I WOULD HAVE TO SUBMIT A CLAIM FOR POSSIBLE REIMBURSEMENT. I CANNOT AFFORD TO RENT A VEHICLE UNTIL THIS ISSUE UNTIL A PERMANENT FIX IS DETERMINED BY FCA AS IT COULD BE MONTHS. STALLING WHILE DRIVING IS A HUGE SAFETY RISK.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS INCLUDED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 17V572000 (SERVICE BRAKES, SERVICE BRAKES, HYDRAULIC), WHICH HAD BEEN REVISED. ALBERIC CHRYSLER DODGE JEEP (AVE. KENNEDY KM 2.5 SAN JUAN, PR 00936-8320) STATED THAT THEY WOULD ONLY REPLACE THE WATER SHIELD PER THE RECALL AND NOT THE ACTUAL BRAKE BOOSTER. THE CONTACT THEN SPOKE WITH FLAGSHIP CHRYSLER DODGE JEEP RAM (CARR. #2, KM 14.7, HATO TEJAS, BAYAMN, 00959, PUERTO RICO, +1 787-301-0408) AND WAS INFORMED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO INSPECT THE VEHICLE TO DETERMINE THE REMEDY FOR THE RECALL. THE CONTACT TOOK THE VEHICLE TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHO DIAGNOSED THAT THE BRAKE BOOSTER WAS CORRODED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS CONTACTED AND DID NOT ASSIST. THE RECALL REPAIR HAD NOT BEEN PERFORMED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 60,000.
I PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT THIS 2011 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE (3.6 PENTASTAR ENGINE) STALLS WITHOUT WARNING. THE VEHICLE HAS STALLED AT LEAST TWICE IN AUGUST, NUMEROUS TIMES IN SEPTEMBER, AND ALREADY TWICE THIS MONTH (OCTOBER). WHAT IS MORE CONCERNING IS THERE IS NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT THE WARNS OF THE PENDING STALL CONDITION. ALSO, I HAVE HAD THE THERMOSTAT, LIFTERS, TAPPETS, ROCKER ARMS, CYLINDER HEAD, SPARK PLUGS, AND IGNITION COILS REPLACED AND PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE GETTING WORSE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER (KOONS TYSONS CORNER). THE DEALER CANNOT READ ANY ACTIVE OR STORED CODES FOR THE STALLING ISSUE. ADDITIONALLY, THE SHOP FOREMAN ADVISED THAT IT APPEARED TO BE THE FUEL PUMP. I ORDERED THE $540.00 FUEL PUMP AND HAD REPLACED ON MONDAY OCTOBER 7, 2019 FOR AN ADDITIONAL $630.00. IRONICALLY ENOUGH, THE VEHICLE STALLED GOING HOME AND THE FUEL PUMP REPAIR DID NOT FIX THE ISSUE. THE MECHANIC AND SERVICE ADVISOR NOW SAY THAT I SHOULD REPLACE THE PCM AND THEN THE TIPUM IF ALL ELSE FAILS. THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL $3,000.00 IN ESTIMATED SERVICE THAT THEY CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT WILL FIX THE ISSUE. THE MOST CONCERNING THING IS THAT CHRYSLER WILL NOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS. I HAVE ALSO FILED A COMPLAINT WITH FCA, WHOM INITIALLY JUST CLOSED THE CASE. I THEN FILED ANOTHER ONE TODAY AND REQUESTED TO SPEAK WITH A CASE MANAGER, WHICH IS PENDING (NO FAITH AT THIS POINT). IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT FCA IS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AS ADDRESSED IN THE RECALL:  CHRYSLER IS RECALLING 188,723 2011 DODGE DURANGO AND JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE SUVS IN THE U.S. BECAUSE OF A DEFECTIVE FUEL-PUMP RELAY INSIDE THE POWER MODULE THAT CAN CAUSE THE VEHICLES TO "STALL WITHOUT WARNING."
A LITTLE WHILE AFTER A YEAR OF PURCHASING OUR JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE THE LEATHER DASHBOARD STARTED RIPPLING AND DE-LAMINATING.  SINCE THEN, IT HAS PROGRESSIVELY GOTTEN WORSE.  IT STARTED ON THE FAR RIGHT CORNER OF THE PASSENGER SIDE BUT HAS SINCE DE-LAMINATED ON THE DRIVERS SIDE CORNER AND ALONG THE CENTER DEFROSTING COVER.  DUE TO THE DASHBOARD BEING MADE OF LEATHER, ONCE IT DE-LAMINATED THE SHRINKING PROCESS BEGAN AND WILL ONLY GET WORSE.  THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH COUNTLESS JEEPS WITH LEATHER INTERIOR.  I AM ABSOLUTELY ASTOUNDED THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A RECALL ON THIS MANUFACTURE DEFECT.
CADILLAC CONVERTER
TRANSMISSION LOCKED UP WITH NO WARNING. WHEN BROUGHT TO DEALER HE ADVISED ME IT WOULD HAVE TO GO TO AAMCO TRANSMISSION FOR THE PROPER DIAGNOSIS AND HAVE IT FIXED
I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE FREEWAY AT AROUND 6:40AM IN THE DARK WHEN SENSORS IN MY VEHICLE STARTED FLICKERING ON/OFF, THEN THE AMBIENT LIGHTS INSIDE THE VEHICLE STARTED FLICKERING ON/OFF BEFORE SHUTTING OFF, THEN THE STEREO WENT OUT, THEN THE HEADLIGHTS SHUT OFF, AND THEN THE ENTIRE VEHICLE SHUT OFF. THERE WAS NO WARNING LIGHT THAT THE BATTERY WAS LOW BEFORE ALL OF THIS HAPPENED. THE REPAIR SHOP THE CAR WAS TOWED TO SAID THE BATTERY WAS DEAD AND WOULDN'T HOLD A CHARGE. WHEN THEY TESTED THE ALTERNATOR AFTER REPLACING THE BATTER, IT WAS FOUND TO HAVE ZERO OUTPUT.
STARTER ENGAGES, BUT WILL NOT START WIPERS WORK WITHOUT BEING TURNED ON . BATTERY DEPLETED  FOR NO REASON. ENGINE QUITS FOR NO APPARENT REASON. THIS ALL HAPPENED WHILE VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY,BUT JUST AS EASILY BEEN WHILE MOVING.
THREE INSTANCES WHERE TWO STATIONARY AND ONE IN MOTION FULL ACCELERATION WITH OUT TOUCHING THE GAS PEDAL. THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS A TRANSMISSION FLUID LEAK. CAUSED MY TRANSMISSION OIL TO BURN WHICH LEAD TO A FAULTY TRANSMISSION. PCIM WAS FLASHED AND CAUSED TRANSMISSION TO DECELERATE AT 40MPH LOOSING ALL FUNCTION.
WHILE DRIVING MY CAR DOWN A LOCAL STREET MY AIR SUSPENSION BAG ON MY DRIVERS REAR SIDE EXPLODED. THE ENTIRE REAR SYSTEM DRAINED AND THE BACK OF THE CAR DROPPED.  LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO BRING THE CAR TO A CONTROLLED STOP BUT WAS GOING AROUND A CORNER AND ALMOST LOST CONTROL OF THE CAR
THE FRONT DASH OF MY 2011 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE IS BUBBLING UP AND MAY CAUSE A PROBLEM WITH AIR BAG DEPLOYMENT.  MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS ON THIS SAME PROBLEM AND KEEPS GETTING WORSE.
THE CAR STALLED AND ENGINE SHUT OFF WHILE DRIVING, DECELERATING AROUND A LEFT TURNING CURVE. LOST ACCELERATION CAPABILITY, POWER STEERING, BRAKES, AND ELECTRICAL SYSTEM (NO EMERGENCY FLASHERS). COULD BARELY CONTROL CAR AND ENDED DRIVING THROUGH CURVE, OFF THE ROAD, DOWN INTO SMALL RAVINE AND INTO FIELD. WERE FORTUNATE TO AVOID ROAD SIGNS AND TELEPHONE POLE. CAR RESTARTED AFTER PUTTING GEAR IN PARK. VERY AFRAID TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE ANYMORE. NOT ABLE TO GET APPOINTMENT WITH JEEP DEALER FOR ANOTHER WEEK.  RESEARCH SHOWS THIS COULD BE RELATED TO FAULTY TIPM. OUR SERVICE RECORDS INDICATED THIS JEEP DID RECEIVE CHRYSLER GROUP SAFETY RECALL P54 (NHTSA #14V530) TIPM INTERNAL FUEL PUMP RELAY REPLACEMENT, WHICH STATES IS A POTENTIAL CAUSE OF THE CAR LOSING POWER. SEEMS TO HAVE NOT PREVENTED THE MOVING CAR FROM LOSING POWER.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, WHILE DRIVING, THE VEHICLE STALLED AND LOST POWER WHILE DECELERATING FROM HIGHWAY SPEEDS. AS A RESULT, THE STEERING WHEEL SEIZED. THERE WERE NO WARNING INDICATORS ILLUMINATED.

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE REAR PASSENGER DOOR COULD NOT BE OPENED FROM INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE LOCAL DEALER (RON SAYER CHRYSLER JEEP DODGE IN IDAHO FALLS, IDAHO) WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE DOOR ACTUATOR WAS FAULTY AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE ACTUATOR WAS REPLACED AND THE FAILURE WAS REMEDIED. THE CONTACT INDICATED THAT BOTH THE REAR DRIVER'S SIDE AND FRONT PASSENGER SIDE DOORS LATER EXPERIENCED THE SAME FAILURE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURES. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 50,000.
ENGINE STALLED OUT AT 40 MPH UPON ENTERING A RIGHT TURN EXIT RAMP.  NO POWER STEERING OR BRAKES WERE AVAILABLE UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO STOP THE VEHICLE AND RESTART ENGINE.   CONCERNED IF AIRBAGS WOULD DEPLOY IF ENGINE WAS OFF AND VEHICLE IN MOTION.
STALL ON STARTUP
THE SEATS FEEL LIKE THEY ARE NOT BULGES DOWN PROPERLY AND MOVE DURING TURNS AND YOU CAN HEAR AND FEEL THEM JERK.
QUADRALIFT SUSPENSION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM HAS A HIGH PROPENSITY FOR FAILURE. THIS RESULTS IN AN UNSAFE/UNSTABLE DRIVING CONDITION. 100'S OF COMPLAINTS ARE FOUND ON THE INTERNET. A DESIGN DEFECT IN THIS SYSTEM HAS CAUSED THE HIGH FAILURE RATE. EXPENSIVE REPLACEMENT PARTS ARE UNAVAILABLE OR VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND. THE VEHICLE IS NOT ROAD WORTHY AND DIFFICULT TO CONTROL DUE TO THE POOR DESIGN OF THIS SYSTEM.  HAVE OPENED A CASE WITH JEEP HQ......HOPING TO GET SOME SUPPORT FOR NOT JUST MY FAILED VEHICLE BUT THE 10-15% OF JEEP OWNERS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS MODE OF FAILURE.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE INTERIOR DOME LIGHT REMAINED ILLUMINATED INDICATING THAT A DOOR WAS OPEN HOWEVER; THE DOORS WERE CLOSED AND LOCKED.

PARTS DISTRIBUTION DISCONNECT.
THE RIGHT CYLINDER IN THE VEHICLE IS DEFECTIVE HOWEVER JEEP IS TELLING ME THAT ITS NOT COVERED UNDER ANY WARRANTY. THE VEHICLE IS ONLY 5 YEARS OLD AND SHOULD NOT BE HAVING THESE ISSUES. THE ENGINE LIGHTS KEEPS COMING ON AND MAKING A HEAVY NOISE. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS CAR, LIKE THIS.  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 45 MPH, THE AIR BAG WARNING INDICATOR ILLUMINATED. THE FAILURE OCCURRED APPROXIMATELY FOUR OTHER TIMES INTERMITTENTLY.

FROM 2012 I'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING ISSUES WITH MY VEHICLE HAVING A HARD START AND STALLING WHILE DRIVING IT EVENTUALLY GOT WORST AND ON 7/28/16 IT STALLED AND NEVER START AGAIN. I SMELL SOMETHING BURNING UNDER THE HOOD BUT DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. I AM NOW OUT OF A VEHICLE BECAUSE FOR FOUR YEARS A SOLUTION NOT FOUND FOR THE PROBLEM. MY SOLUTION IS THAT THE WHOLE VEHICLE NEEDS TO BE RECALLED. THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN PUTTING MY FAMILY IN DANGER FOR YEARS.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. WHEN THE CONTACT ATTEMPTED TO START THE VEHICLE, THERE WAS AN ABNORMAL KNOCKING NOISE. IN ADDITION, WHILE DRIVING 40 MPH, THE HEAT FAILED TO OPERATE.

THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 91,705.
WHILE BRAKING THE ENGINE SHUTS OFF. THIS HAPPENED THREE TIMES. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER I BOUGHT IT FROM AND THEY SAID IT WAS WORN SPARK PLUGS AND REPLACED THEM. THE NEXT DAY IT STALLED AGAIN. I WAS COMING OFF THE FREEWAY OFF RAMP AND IT JUST DIED. NO WARNING LIGHTS ON THE DASH.  THE DEALER WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE A CAUSE FOR THE STALLING ISSUE. UPDATED 04/18/16. *JB

THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE.
VEHICLE HAS COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN WHILE DRIVING 5 TIMES IN THE RECENT PAST. 1X19 OCT; 2X31 OCT; 2X7NOV. THE VEHICLE COMPLETELY SHUTS OFF WHILE DRIVING. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AS ALL POWER IS LOST FOR BREAKS, STEERING, AND OBVIOUSLY NO ACCELERATION. CHRYSLER SAFETY RECALL P54 HAS BEEN APPLIED PRIOR TO THESE ISSUES. DEALER AND CHRYSLER ARE CHARGING ME CUSTOMER (AT MY EXPENSE) TO FLASH NEW SOFTWARE FILES ON THE VEHICLE COMPUTERS. I SENSE THIS IS VERY LIKELY A MUCH BROADER SAFETY ISSUE AND AM HOPING OUR GOVERNMENT (NHTSA) OFFICIALS WILL INVESTIGATE BEFORE SOMEONE IS INJURED AS A RESULT OF THIS.
I WAS OUT DRIVING FROM THE GROCERY STORE AND I WAS PRESSING ON THE BREAKS TO TURN A CURVE THE VEHICLE SPEEDED UP.  I WAS ORIGINALLY GOING  25 MPH AND STARTED TO SLOW UP BECAUSE I WAS APPROACHING A CURVE BUT INSTEAD OF IT SLOWING DOWN IT SPED UP TO 35MPH WHILE GOING AROUND A CURVE.  THANK GOD NO ONE ELSE WAS ON THE ROAD AT THAT TIME.  TWO WEEKS LATER MY HUSBAND STATED THAT WHEN HE WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE THE SAME EXACT THEN HAPPENED TO HIM.  AT THAT TIME WE TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO GILMAN CHRYSLER AND JEEP IN HOUSTON TX WHERE WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE FROM (8/10/14).  THEY CLAIM THEY TESTED THE VEHICLE AND FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.  MY HUSBAND AND I KEPT EXPLAINING TO THE SERVICE GUY THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE AND WE DON'T WANT TO GET INTO AN ACCIDENT FOR AN ISSUE THAT CAN BE RESOLVED.  THE SERVICE GUY STATED THAT THEY DID ALL THEY COULD BUT THEY WILL KEEP OUR INFORMATION ON FILE.  I AM VERY UPSET WITH THIS SITUATION.  MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE THREE CHILDREN IN WHICH ARE IN THIS VEHICLE ALL THE TIME.  THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL RECALLS ON THIS VEHICLE AND NONE OF WHICH HAVE BEEN REPAIRED BECAUSE GILMAN CHRYSLER WOULD STATE THEY DON'T HAVE THE PART OR THEY DON'T SEE A RECALL AT THIS TIME.    I WANT SOMETHING TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS NOW BEFORE SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENS.  I WILL NOT LET THIS SITUATION GO.  I WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR A RESOLUTION UNTIL SOMEONE RESOLVES IT.  PLEASE CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY ABOUT THIS SITUATION AS THIS IS THE ONLY VEHICLE THAT WE HAVE.
7/27/15 I WAS AT A COMPLETE STOP BEFORE I WAS GOING TO TURN INTO THE PARKING SPACE. I WAITED UNTIL A VAN PASSED AND AGAIN, WAS AT A COMPLETE STOP. I GENTLY PRESSED THE GAS PEDAL WHEN WITHIN SECONDS THE CAR TOOK OFF ON ITS OWN. WITHIN SECONDS MY CAR REVVED ON ITS OWN AND TOOK OFF; SLAMMING ME INTO A CONCRETE WALL BARRIER THAT SAVED ME FROM DRIVING INTO A DRY CLEANING STORE WINDOW.DURING THIS ENTIRE TIME, MY FOOT BARELY PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR AND MY CAR TOOK OFF. THANKFULLY A MAN CAME TO ME AND TOLD ME TO JUST PUT THE CAR IN PARK AS I WAS HITTING THE BREAK AND MY WHEELS WERE STILL SPINNING. THE BARRIER WAS LITERALLY KEEPING ME FROM GOING THROUGH THE LARGE WINDOW. IT WASN'T UNTIL THEN THAT MY CAR STOPPED. ACCORDING TO THE POLICE REPORT I WAS GOING 5 MPH. IF THIS WAS THE CASE, WHY DID I CRACK THE CONCRETE BARRIER, BURN RUBBER INTO THE ASPHALT SO MUCH THAT MY WHEELS MADE DEEP BLACK MARKS ON THE ROAD AND MY ENTIRE FRONT BUMPER ALL THE WAY TO THE RAILS WERE COMPLETELY CRUSHED. WOULD 5MPH CAUSE $7,000 WORTH OF DAMAGE? I DON'T THINK SO. IN ADDITION MY SEATBELT DID NOT LOCK UPON IMPACT. MY HEAD SLAMMED INTO THE STEERING WHEEL BEFORE THE SEATBELT LOCKED RESULTING IN WHIPLASH. MY AIR BAG ALSO DID NOT DEPLOY. AT THE RATE I WAS GOING AND WITH THE FORCE OF IMPACT I HIT THE BARRIER WITH THERE WAS NO REASON FOR MY SEATBELT NOT TO INSTANTLY LOCK AND MY AIRBAG NOT DEPLOY TO PROTECT MY HEAD AND NECK. MY CAR IS CURRENTLY BEING FIXED BUT I DO NOT FEEL SAFE WITH THAT CAR NOR SELLING IT TO ANYONE ELSE, LEST THIS HAPPEN. WHAT IF A FAMILY BUYS THIS CAR AND DIES DUE TO THIS? I KNOW I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS ISSUE AND I WANT SOMEONE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND ADMIT THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON WITH THESE CARS. THREE MAJOR RECALLS FOR THE 2011 AND ONE THAT I FEEL LEAD TO MY ACCIDENT. HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS BEFORE AN INVESTIGATION OCCURS.

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
I WAS HAVING PROBLEMS STARTING MY 2011 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. SOMETIMES IT STARTED AND THEN THE ENGINE DIED WHICH IS VERY DANGEROUS. I TOOK IT IN TO JEEP SERVICE AND THEY REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP RELAY IN THE TIPM.  *TR
IN JUNE 2012 MY VEHICLE BEGAN GIVING PROBLEMS STARTING AFTER SEVERAL DAYS BACK AND FORTH TO THE DEALER I WAS TOLD MY VEHICLE NEEDS A PCM. THE PCM WAS ORDERED AND REPLACED BUT THE PROBLEM STILL EXIST. I WAS THEN TOLD THE TIPM HAD AN ISSUE. THE TIPM WAS REPLACED AND THE VEHICLE SEEMS TO BE WORKING AS FAR AS THE ISSUES STARTING BUT I KEPT HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE SHUTTING OFF WHILE DRIVING. MONTHS AND MOTHS WENT BY WITH ME HAVING THIS ISSUE UNTIL THEY PLACED A DEVICE ON MY VEHICLE TO RECORD WHAT'S HAPPENING. AFTER KEEPING MY VEHICLE FOR A WHOLE DAY TO REMOVE THE DEVICE, A WEEK LATER THEY SAID IT DID NOT RECORD ANYTHING BECAUSE IT WENT DEAD. HOWEVER, I WAS TOLD TO BRING THE VEHICLE BACK IN FOR THEM TO CHECK SPARK PLUGS, TRANSMISSION, AND OTHER THINGS I DID SO AND THE PROBLEM WENT A WAY FOR COUPLE MONTHS ONLY TO COME RIGHT BACK.     RIGHT NOW I AM RIGHT BACK AT SQUARE ONE WITH THE VEHICLE GIVING A HARD START AND THE VEHICLE SHUTTING OFF WHILE DRIVING. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THESE VEHICLES. THEY NEED TO BE OVERHAULED.  *TR

TRAVELING AT ABOUT 68 MPH WITH SPEED CONTROL ENGAGED, AFTER ABOUT 30 MINUTES I NOTICED A DECLINING VEHICLE SPEED & STABILITY CONTROL WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED.  AFTER UNSUCCESSFULLY TRYING TO RE ENGAGE SPEED CONTROL, I PULLED OFF THE HIGHWAY.  I DEPRESSED THE DASH BOARD STABILITY CONTROL  BUTTON SEVERAL TIMES AND THE STABILITY CONTROL LIGHT WAS STILL ON.  I TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE AND RESTARTED & THE STABILITY CONTROL LIGHT WAS OFF.  WE RESUMED OUR TRIP USING SPEED CONTROL WITH FURTHER INCIDENT.  THIS HAS OCCURRED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE, BUT ONLY WITH SPEED CONTROL ENGAGED.  ON A RECENT TRIP AFTER ABOUT 30 MINUTES @ 65 - 70 MPH WITH SPEED CONTROL ENGAGED THE SAME ISSUE OCCURRED AGAIN UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES AND SAME CORRECTIVE ACTION TAKEN.  I THEN CONTINUED FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS AT THE SAME SPEED WITHOUT SPEED CONTROL AND FURTHER INCIDENT.  SINCE THEN A TECHNICIAN HAS ATTEMPTED TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE WITHOUT RESULTS.

SINCE THE WEATHER HAS GOTTEN COLD, THE POWER BRAKES ON MY 2011 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE HAVE BEEN FAILING ON AN INTERMITTENT BASIS NEARLY RESULTING IN A COUPLE ACCIDENTS.      IN THE PROCESS OF COMPLETING A THOROUGH INSPECTION, I DETECTED A HISSING SOUND WHEN I DEPRESSED THE BRAKE PEDAL.  SUSPECTING THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE VACUUM BOOSTER, I CALLED SEVERAL PARTS STORES IN ATTEMPT TO FIND A REPLACEMENT UNIT ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT NO ONE HAD ACCESS TO THE PART AND THEY WERE ON INDEFINITE BACKORDER.  AFTER DOING EXTENSIVE ONLINE RESEARCH, I HAVE COME TO FIND OUT THAT THERE APPEARS TO BE A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THE JEEP VACUUM BOOSTERS RESULTING IN A NATIONAL SHORTAGE OF REPLACEMENT PARTS.  BASED UPON THE REPORTS BY OTHERS, IT APPEARS THAT THERE IS A SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW WITH THE VACUUM BOOSTER WHICH IS EXACERBATED DURING COLD PERIODS.  IT IS ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE NHTSA IS COMPLETING AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE PROBLEM.    IN SHORT, I AM BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE.  I CANNOT GET A REPLACEMENT PART TO FIX MY BRAKES AND I AM DEATHLY AFRAID TO DRIVE MY VEHICLE.  ON BEHALF OF MY FELLOW CONSUMERS, WE NEED THE NHTSA TO PUT PRESSURE ON THE JEEP CORPORATION TO STEP UP AND ADDRESS THE PROBLEM BEFORE SOMEONE GETS SERIOUSLY HURT OR KILLED.  *TR

VEHICLE CRANKING LONG BEFORE STARTING, DEALER DIAGNOSTIC WAS TIPM, JEEP WAS CONTACTED THEY AGREED THEY HAS ISSUES WITH PART MENTIONED AND AGREED IN PROVIDE PART W/$100 DEDUCTIBLE, I STILL PAID FOR THE CRANKING SENSOR AND LABOR, NEW TIPM CREATED MORE ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS. WHEN TURNING SIGNAL WAS ACTIVATED FOG LIGHTS WERE BLINKING BUT NOT THE TURNING LIGHTS, TAKEN BACK TO DEALER THEY TEMPORARY FIX THE PROBLEM UNTIL JEEP RELEASES THE NEW UPDATE IN AT LEAST 2 MONTHS, AFTER THEY FIXED THE TURNING LIGHTS ANOTHER ISSUED RESULTED, NOW THE STOP TAIL BRAKE LIGHTS DON'T TURN ON IF IGNITION SWITCH IS NOT IN ON POSITION AND SOMETIMES EVEN WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING , OR IF ENGINE IS NOT RUNNING. THIS ISSUE CONCERNS ME A LOT, SINCE THIS IS VERY CRITICAL IF DRIVING ON HIGHWAY AND ENGINE STOP WORKING HOW I WILL LET THE VEHICLES BEHIND ME THAT I HAVE AN EMERGENCY AND I'M STEPPING ON THE BRAKES,LIGHTS WILL NOT TURN ON. ARE YOU PEOPLE FROM NHTSA WAITING UNTIL FATALITIES HAPPEN TO FORCE JEEP TO MAKE A RECALL AND FIX THE PROBLEMS.? THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF VEHICLES WITH FAILURES RELATED TO THIS TIPM   , PLEASE PREVENT PEOPLE DIE IN CRASHES FOR THIS ISSUE AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. NOW MY CAR IS IN THE DEALER AGAIN BECAUSE THEY CAN PROPERLY FIX IT, AND ALL RELATED TO THIS NEW TIPM.

I BOUGHT A 2011 GRAND CHEROKEE FROM SHAVE JEEP IN THOUSAND OAKS, CA.  THE VEHICLE STARTED TO MALFUNCTION WITHIN DAYS AFTER PURCHASE.  IT WOULD SEIZE UP, USUALLY AT HIGHWAY SPEED, STALL OUT, THUS LOSING POWER STEERING AND BRAKES.  I BROUGHT THE CAR IN FOR SERVICE ABOUT 8 TIMES UNTIL I ALMOST GOT HIT BY A BIG RIG ON THE HIGHWAY AT NIGHT WHEN MY CAR DIED.  THE CONSTANT ENGINE LIGHT READING WAS A CAMSHAFT POSITION SENSOR.  CHRYSLER TECHS ATTEMPTED TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM WITHOUT ANY LUCK.  UNFORTUNATELY THE DEALER SWAPPED OUT CARS WITH ME AND I FOUND OUT THEY SOLD THIS VEHICLE WITHOUT TELLING THE NEW OWNERS OF THE MAJOR MECHANICAL PROBLEMS. *TR
2011, 2012 CHRYSLER VEHICLES WITH THE PENTASTAR V6 3.6 LITER ENGINE ARE RATED TO TOW 5000 LBS UNRESTRICTED WITH THE TOW PACKAGE INSTALLED.  THERE IS A DESIGN DEFECT IN THE COOLING SYSTEM IN THAT IT CANNOT COOL THE ENGINE WHEN TOWING ABOUT 3500 LBS UPHILL.  THE TOW VEHICLE STARTS UPHILL AT THE HIGHWAY SPEEDS OF 65MPH IN THE PASSING LANES WITH ENOUGH POWER TO CONTINUE AND SUDDENLY WITHOUT ANY WARNING, LIGHTS, ETC., THE TOW VEHICLE LOOSES POWER AND ABRUPTLY SLOWS TO A MAXIMUM SPEED OF ABOUT 27MPH.  WITH ALL OTHER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD TRYING TO GET BY AND NOT SLOW DOWN, THIS CREATES AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION OF ATTEMPTING TO CROSS 3 LANES OR MORE TO GET OFF THE ROAD WHILE TRACTOR TRAILERS HAVE TO SLAM ON THE BRAKES AND HOPEFULLY SCREECH TO AN ALMOST STOPPED POSITION TO AVOID KILLING THE FAMILIES IN THE TOW VEHICLES.  CHRYSLER HAS CONFIRMED THE PROBLEM BUT HAS REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND HAS INSISTED THAT THE VEHICLES ARE WORKING THE WAY THEY WERE DESIGNED BUT ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT WORKING WITHIN THE ADVERTISED SPECIFICATIONS.  CHRYSLER DOES NOT WANT TO CHANGE THE ADVERTISED SPECS DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT MIGHT COST THEM MONEY, EVEN THOUGH MANY PEOPLES LIVES ARE AT RISK. CHRYSLER COULD EASILY PERFORM A RECALL AND FIX THE PROBLEM, SAVING LIVES, BUT THERE WOULD BE A SMALL MONETARY COST TO CHRYSLER.  *JS

2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee HEMI. As traveling whether on highway or on streets no matter the speeds the Jeep tends to just stall out out of no where especially when braking and coming to a stop it completely shuts off, no engine, no steering and then must have to engage into park or neutral to push to start up the Jeep again. It is very dangerous and scary any time it happens and even more so when happens on highway. It has been an on going issue since I bought the vehicle in NOV. 2018 but only happens every once in a while and out of the blue when it does. I did reached out several years ago to the manufacturer Mopar Jeep Chrysler but they had no solution for me. I had a case number with them but it was so long ago I cannot remember now. I did have the recall on the fuel pump relay in which I thought that would resolve my issue but unfortunately it did not and I still experience this Jeep stalling out at any point while driving, onto braking, and then to the stop. Any help? Thanks
The contact owns a 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The contact stated while driving at an undisclosed speed, the contact became aware of smoke coming from the engine compartment. The contact stated there a large amount of smoke coming from the alternator. Additionally, the vehicle had no electrical power. The vehicle was towed to an independent mechanic where it was diagnosed with a failed alternator. The contact was informed that the alternator was burned. The contact was informed that the alternator needed to be replaced. The vehicle was being repaired. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 120,000.
My husband was involved in a serious collision with another vehicle on July 20, 2023 and he sustained serious injuries because the airbags never deployed.
My Grand Cherokee started idling rough, then developed a misfire and often times while driving it would just die even while driving on the highway. It almost caused me to have an accident on two occasions. I learned on the NHTSA website my Jeep had an open recall and I contacted my local Jeep dealer only to have them tell me that the parts needed to perform the repair were "restricted"
I have been waiting for over 2 years for Jeep to complete the recall for V62/NHTSA 19V-813.  In May of 2020, the fuel pump relay failed and my Jeep would not start.  The dealer (Fort Collins Jeep in Fort Collins CO) replaced the relay with the same previous version of the relay, which fixed the problem but did not satisfy the recall.  They did not have parts available to fix the recall and I was put on a wait list.  In the fall of 2020 I moved from Colorado to Tucson, AZ.  In June 2021, I called Larry H Miller Chrysler/Jeep dealer in Tucson and was put on a wait list for the part.  It's now been almost another year since then and they are still telling me that they don't have the parts available.  For what is considered a safety issue, it seems wrong to have to wait for years to have it fixed.  (Note:  The date I entered, 5/19/2020, is the day that the Jeep failed to start.  The recall was originally issued long before this.)   (RECALL RELATED INCIDENTS)   TS

My Jeep has shut off / stalled on me twice now since I have purchased it last month. This is an absolute random issue, and happens while driving. The engine will shut off with no warning, and you loose power steering and power brakes. Very scary, and a very serious and deadly condition. Jeep and Chrysler are no help. Was at the dealership for three days, and they said they can’t find the issue, and gave it back to me. Pathetic!

CHRYSLER RECALL V62 SAFETY RECALL FOR FUEL PUMP RELAY IS NOW OVER 6 MONTHS OLD. STILL NO PARTS MADE AVAILABLE TO DEALERS TO PROVIDE REPAIR. PERIODICALLY CANNOT START VEHICLE DUE TO LACK OF POWER TO THE FUEL PUMP, SO CANNOT DRIVE VEHICLE SAFELY WITH POSSIBILITY ENGINE COULD STOP WHILE DRIVING. CANNOT DRIVE UNSAFE VEHICLE. WHEN I CONTACTED CHRYSLER NUMEROUS TIMES, NO ONE CAN TELL ME WHEN THIS WILL BE REMEDIED. VEHICLE IS PARKED SINCE DECEMBER. HAVE TO BORROW A CAR FROM SON. NHTSA SHOULD FORCE CHRYSLER TO DECLARE THIS AS MANDATORY RECALL. IT AFFECTS OVER 520,000 VEHICLES. ALL THOSE PEOPLE ARE RISKING THEIR LIVES AND THOSE OF THEIR FAMILIES BY DRIVING A VEHICLE WHOSE ENGINE COULD STALL WHILE DRIVING. A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OF CHRYSLER MAY BE NECESSARY IF NHTSA CANNOT FORCE CHRYSLER TO DELIVER THE REMEDY. IF PEOPLE DIE DUE TO THE DELAYS AND NEGLIGENCE, NHTSA AND CHRYSLER ARE BOTH RESPONSIBLE. SICK AND TIRED OF THIS INCOMPETENCE AND DANGEROUS DELAY.  IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER HOW MANY PEOPLE COMPLAIN TO NHTSA OR CHRYSLER. LIVES ARE AT RISK AND NO ONE IS DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
VEHICLE WOULD NOT START. VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO DEALERSHIP AND FUEL PUMP RELAY WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM, RECALL EXISTS AND THE FUEL PUMP RELAY WAS REPLACED. HOWEVER, FUEL PUMP RELAY CAUSED THE BATTERY TO DRAIN ALSO NECESSITATING REPLACEMENT. FCA/MOPAR ONLY AUTHORIZED REIMBURSEMENT OF THE FUEL PUMP RELAY AND NOT FOR THE BATTERY EVEN THOUGH IT WAS DIRECTLY RELATED AND THE DEALERSHIP TECHNICIAN STATED THE SAME. SPOKE WITH MULTIPLE REPS FROM FCA WHO COULD NOT PROVIDE ANY ASSISTANCE. AN OIL CHANGE AND SYSTEMS DIAGNOSTIC TEST WAS PERFORMED ON THE VEHICLE JUST BEFORE THE FUEL PUMP FAILURE AND NO ISSUES WITH THE BATTERY WERE IDENTIFIED. I WAS TOLD THE BATTERY COULD NOT BE REPLACED BECAUSE I TRIED TO START THE VEHICLE...WHICH SEEMS INCREDULOUS TO ME AS THAT IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY LEAVE FOR WORK. HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THE FUEL PUMP RELAY NEEDED TO BE REPLACED UNLESS I TRIED TO START THE VEHICLE AND IT WOULDN'T TURN OVER?

MY GRAND CHEROKEE HAS STALLED SEVERAL DOZEN TIMES OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AND THE DEALER CAN'T FIX IT. THE CAR STALLS WHEN SLOWING TO A STOP OR TURNING THROUGH AN INTERSECTION BUT WE CAN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AT THE SERVICE CENTER.    THE DEALER KEPT THE CAR FOR NEARLY A MONTH TRYING TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM BUT COULD NOT, BUT I HAVE KEPT RECORDS OVER THE PAST YEAR OF ALL STALLS AND THE CONDITIONS AND THE ONLY CONDITION THAT REMAINS CONSTANT IS THAT I AM QUICKLY BRAKING FROM 40 MPH OR FASTER OR I AM BRAKING WHILE TURNING. INITIALLY IT ONLY OCCURRED WHILE TURNING LEFT, BUT NOW IT OCCURS WHILE TURNING RIGHT AND WHILE BRAKING QUICKLY WHILE GOING STRAIGHT.    I HAVE BEEN IN SEVERAL NEAR MISSES DUE TO LOSING POWER STEERING AND BRAKES AND I AM TO THE POINT TO WHERE I CAN'T ALLOW ANYONE BUT ME TO DRIVE THE CAR DUE TO THE SAFETY FACTOR. TWICE I ALMOST HIT A CAR WHILE TURNING AND ONCE A BIG RIG ALMOST HIT ME IN THE SIDE AS THE CAR STALLED MID-INTERSECTION OF A SIX LANE HIGHWAY.    THE CAR IS STILL UNDER CHRYSLER'S WARRANTY, AND AS NOTED, THE DEALER HAS TRIED TO FIX THE PROBLEM, BUT HAS FAILED TIME AFTER TIME.    THE PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED DOZENS OF TIMES BUT THE LATEST TIME WAS TODAY, AT WHICH POINT I DECIDED TO SUBMIT THIS COMPLAINT.    ALTHOUGH I CAN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM ON DEMAND, THERE ARE 3LOCATIONS WHERE IT MOST OFTEN OCCURS, AND IT MOST OFTEN OCCURS IN THE MORNING. THE FIRST LOCATION IS ABOUT 2.5 MILES FROM MY HOUSE, AND THE OTHER TWO ARE 5 MILES EACH FROM MY HOUSE. TWO OF THE THREE LOCATIONS ARE AT INTERSECTIONS WITH RED LIGHTS, WHILE THE THIRD IS SIMPLY THE LOCATION OF WHERE I WORK WHERE IT HAS STALLED MULTIPLE TIMES WHILE JUST TURNING INTO THE DRIVEWAY. IT ALSO HAS STALLED SEVERAL TIMES WHILE COMING HOME OR JUST DRIVING AROUND OR ON VACATION.    DEALER HAS REPLACED FUEL PUMP RELAY, WIRING, AND SOME EMISSION CONTROL PARTS.
I HAD BEEN EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS WITH MY CAR STALLING WHILE CRANKING OR IT WOULD GET HUNG UP AND CUT RIGHT BACK OFF MORE THAN 3X NUMEROUS TIMES SO MANY I CAN'T COUNT! I CALLED MOPAR SERVICE NUMBER BECAUSE THE FIRST FUEL PUMP RELAY CALL AND THEY DID ABSOLUTELY TOLD ME TO GO TO A DEALERSHIP AND RUN DIAGNOSTICS WHICH IS AROUND $200 RIGHT OFF THE BAT! THIS WAS MAY OF 2019 HERE IT IS NOV AND THERE IS NOT A REMEDY YET OR PARTS AVAILABLE! I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY AND BE REIMBURSED ESPECIALLY WHEN I CALLED WAY BEFORE NOW ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEM AS BEFORE!
WHEN THE CAR IS STATIONARY IT WILL NOT START WHEN THE BUTTON IS PUSHED.  THE CAR SHUDDERS AND THE COMPUTER FREEZES. IT CAN ONLY START WHEN THE KEY IS USED IN PLACE OF THE PUSH BUTTON. IT SEEMS AS IF THE STARTER IS NOT RELAYING TO THE FUEL PUMP. THIS CAR UNDERWENT A BIG RECALL IN MARCH OF 2017. THE FUEL PUMP, FUSE BOX, BATTERY AND ALTERNATOR WERE REPLACED. IT WAS AT THE DEALERS FOR THREE WEEKS. THE JEEP BROKE DOWN AND HAD SMOKE COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD. UNFORTUNATELY, WE RECEIVED THE RECALL NOTICE THREE DAYS AFTER THE PROBLEM OCCURRED, SO WE HAD TAKEN IT TO OUR MECHANIC.  THEN WE HAD TO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL TOW TO THE DEALERSHIP. (RECALL R09)
AFTER FAILING INSPECTION IT WAS IN SHOP 6 WEEKS FOR REPAIR BUT WAS NOT REPAIRED! IT MISSES MORE THAN EVER, MOST OFTEN DURING IDLE & HAS DIFFICULTY STARTING AT TIMES & YOU CAN SMELL GAS SOMETIMES MAKING ME FEAR IT WILL CATCH FIRE.
MY JEEP WAS DRIVING JUST FIND UNTIL A COUPLE DAYS AGO.  I HEARD A GNARLY POP AND PSSSSSSSTTTTTT NOISE FROM THE RIGHT FRONT OF MY CAR.  LUCKILY I JUST PULLED INTO MY  DADS DRIVEWAY, SINCE I THOUGHT MY TIRE POPPED AND WAS HISSING AIR OUT.  I GET OUT TO FIND THAT MY FRONT AIR SUSPENSION, ON BOTH SIDES, WAS DONE FOR...  IT IS CURRENTLY IN THE SHOP AND AWAITING INSPECTION.  I READ THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO MANY JEEP GC OWNERS WHICH IS RIDICULOUS, AND JEEP/MOPAR SHOULD LOOK INTO THIS FURTHER!  HOPEFULLY THE REPAIRS DON'T COST ME AN ARM AND LEG, BECAUSE I AM FRESH OUT...
GRAND CHEROKEE RECALL  JEEP FAILED TO MAKE US AWARE OF AN ALTERNATOR RECALL. MY HUSBAND BROKE DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD (NEARLY KILLED MIND YOU.) WE HAD OUR CAR TOWED TO OUR MECHANIC. MECHANIC FIXED THE VEHICLE, AND MENTIONED TO US THAT THE PART HAD ACTUALLY BEEN RECALLED, AGAIN THIS WAS THE FIRST THAT WE WERE MADE AWARE OF THIS. WE CONTACTED JEEP AND PUT IN A CLAIM. JEEP, FIVE MONTHS LATER, TOLD US THAT WE ARE ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR HALF OF WHAT WE SPENT ON THE REPAIR, BECAUSE OUR MECHANIC WAS ONLY 1.6 MILES AWAY FROM A JEEP DEALER. WHY WOULD I GO TO A JEEP DEALER TO PAY A PREMIUM NOT KNOWING THE ISSUE WAS ACTUALLY BECAUSE JEEPS NEGLECT TO INFORM US OF THE RECALL?  HALF THE REIMBURSEMENT, DOES NOT EVEN COVER THE COST FOR THE TOW.
STARTING ISSUES, STARTS UP AND QUICKLY CUTS OFF. ALL LIGHTS AND POWER ARE ON. PLENTY OF FUEL IN TANK BUT NOT OVERFILLED. I THINK IT IS THE FUEL INJECTION AREA. I WORRY IT WILL JUST CUT OFF DUE TO THAT WHILE DRIVING. THIS HAS HAPPENED AT LEAST 3 TIMES IN THE PAST 3 WEEKS, IT IS BECOMING MORE FREQUENT.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. THE CONTACT  STATED THAT THE WELDING ON THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE WAS RUSTED. AS A RESULT, THE ENTIRE REAR FRAME OF THE VEHICLE BECAME DETACHED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO LITHIA JEEP DODGE OF BRYAN COLLEGE STATION (301 N EARL RUDDER FWY, BRYAN, TX 77802, (979) 213-5361) TO BE DIAGNOSED, BUT NO ASSISTANCE WAS PROVIDED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE AND DID NOT ASSIST. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 100,000.
THE VEHICLE HAS NOW HAD IT'S 3RD WATER PUMP REPLACEMENT, JEEP HAS PUT A WARRANTY EXTENSION ON THE WATER PUMP'S FOR THE 13-17 MODEL YEARS AND I HAVE A 2012 WITH THE SAME EFFECTED PART AND JEEP REFUSE'S TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THEY KNOW ITS A PROBLEM, THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING FOR ME AND I HAVE HAD TO HAVE IT FIXED BY AN INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOP. THE WARRANTY EXTENSION IS X73 FROM JEEP.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. WHILE DRIVING OUT OF A PUBLIC PARKING LOT, THE VEHICLE STALLED WITHOUT WARNING. THE CONTACT SHIFTED THE GEAR INTO PARK AND WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE VEHICLE. THE CONTACT DROVE HOME, BUT THE VEHICLE FAILED TO START AGAIN. THE CONTACT CALLED MONROEVILLE CHRYSLER JEEP AT (412) 856-1422 (LOCATED AT 3651 WILLIAM PENN HWY, MONROEVILLE, PA 15146) AND WAS ADVISED TO SCHEDULE A DIAGNOSTIC APPOINTMENT. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 72,000.
THE CAR STARTED OVERHEATING RANDOMLY WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY. PULLED OFF, AND THE RADIATOR HOSE WAS LEAKING, AND THE BATTERY LIGHT TURNED ON, IN THE VEHICLE. THE CAR WAS LEAKING FLUID, BELIEVE IT TO BE RADIATOR, AND AC FLUID. TOOK THE JEEP INTO THE MECHANIC TO VERIFY THE ISSUE, AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. SHORTLY BEFORE TAKING THE JEEP TO THE MECHANIC, WHILE DRIVING, THE SERVICE 4WD LIGHT APPEARED, AND THEN THE RED LIGHTNING BOLT TURNED APPEARED AS WELL, ON THE DASH AS WELL. NOT SURE WHAT IS GOING ON WITH IT NOW.

THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE. PARTS DISTRIBUTION DISCONNECT.
A WEEK AGO MY BATTERY LIGHT CAME ON IN MY CAR ON MY WAY HOME. LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO GET HOME BEFORE IT DIED. WE DROVE MY CAR TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC THAT WE ALWAYS GO TO GET IT DIAGNOSED.  MY MECHANIC SAID I MADE IT JUST IN TIME BECAUSE WHEN THEY WENT TO START MY VEHICLE IT WAS COMPLETELY DEAD. THEY DIAGNOSED THAT I HAD A BAD BATTERY AND REPLACED IT. THEY ALSO IDENTIFIED THAT THE ALTERNATOR WAS BAD AND SAID THERE WAS A RECALL ON IT (I NEVER RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE ON THIS PART THOUGH). MY CAR WAS TOWED TO A NEARBY CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP AND THEY COMPLETED ALL THE OPEN RECALLS ON IT, INCLUDING THE ALTERNATOR BELT. THEN MY CAR WAS TOWED BACK TO MY INDEPENDENT MECHANIC. AFTER MY MECHANIC RAN MY CAR FOR 20 MINUTES THE CAR SHUT OFF AND IT WAS FOUND THAT THE POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE SHORTED. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE TO REPORT THE ISSUE. IT HAS BEEN OVER A WEEK AND I HAVE SPOKEN TO 5 DIFFERENT CUSTOMER SERVICE AGENTS. EVERY SINGLE ONE HAS TOLD ME SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND A DIFFERENT PROCESS I HAVE TO FOLLOW. MY CAR HAS BEEN TOWED BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND JUST SITTING THERE. IT HAS BEEN OVER A WEEK SINCE I HAVE HAD MY CAR. I JUST HEARD FROM A CUSTOMER SERVICE AGENT TODAY THAT THE CAR HAS TO BE DIAGNOSED BY THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY HAVE TO DECLARE THAT THE PCM IS NOT WORKING. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER THAT. I AM REALLY TRYING TO GET THEM TO PAY FOR THIS AND NOT GO THROUGH A REIMBURSEMENT PROCESS BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE FAITH I WILL ACTUALLY GET REIMBURSED IN THE END. I AM SO DISGUSTED WITH THE TREATMENT CHRYSLER HAS GIVEN ME. THEY OBVIOUSLY ARE TRYING EVERYTHING TO GET OUT OF PAYING THIS. WELL THEY PICKED THE WRONG PERSON TO MESS WITH, I WILL NOT BACK DOWN.
AT APPROXIMATELY 50,000 MY VEHICLE DEVELOPED AN EXHAUST LEAK.
CAR SUDDENLY ACCELERATED ON ITS OWN WHEN SLOWLY BEING DRIVEN IN REVERSE IN DRIVEWAY. SHOT  BACKWARDS AND EVENTUALLY HIT TREE AND STOPPED. THIS WAS NOT USER ERROR. THE FLOOR MAT WAS NOT STUCK. ALL THIS WAS CHECKED.
33K MILAGE TOOK MY JEEP IN TO GET THE ROUTINE OIL CHANGE, THE SHOP FOUND THE RACK AND PINION ASSEMBLY WAS COMPLETELY BROKE AND THE FRONT STRUTS WERE COMPLETELY BLOWN OUT AT 33K MILES THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. THE REPAIRS COST $3,700.00. IF JEEP KNOWS THERE WAS A PROBLEM IN 2012 THEY SHOULD HAVE TAKEN CARE OF IT. BETTY / THORNTON, COLORADO
WHILE STOPPING AT A DRIVE-THROUGH ON MY WAY TO WORK, THE BRAKE SYSTEM EXPERIENCED AN ISSUE. I WAS AT A STOP WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL BACKED UP FROM THE FLOOR AND THE JEEP STARTED TO ROLL FORWARD. I HAD TO STAND ON THE PEDAL WITH BOTH FEET TO KEEP THE VEHICLE STOPPED. I WAS ABLE TO PARK FOR A MOMENT IN ORDER TO FIND A WAY TO GET THE VEHICLE SAFELY TO A NEARBY REPAIR SHOP. THEY IDENTIFIED THE ISSUE AS MY BRAKE BOOSTER. THIS PART WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED WITH SAFETY RECALL P14 BACK IN 2014. EITHER THE PART WAS NOT REPLACED, THE REPAIR WAS NOT EFFECTIVE, OR THE REPLACEMENT WAS ALSO DEFECTIVE SO AS TO CAUSE THE SAME FAILURE FOR MY JEEP NOW. ONLY 5 YEARS OLD AND MY SECOND CATASTROPHIC SYSTEM FAILURE IN AS MANY MONTHS. SO GLAD I WAS NOT STILL ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN THIS HAPPENED OR THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT!
WHILE DRIVING HOME FROM WORK DURING RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC ON THE HIGHWAY, THE RED BATTERY LIGHT CAME FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE I OWNED THE VEHICLE.  WITHIN MINUTES OF THE LIGHT APPEARING, THE JEEP'S AIR CONDITIONING WENT OFF, ALL WARNING LIGHTS APPEARED ON THE DASHBOARD AND THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS TURNED ON (WITHOUT PROMPTING THEM). ALL THREE OF THESE THINGS HAPPENED WITHIN SECONDS OF EACH OTHER SO I TRIED TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY BUT THE JEEP LOST ALL POWER AND STALLED IN THE RIGHT LANE OF THE HIGHWAY. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY ZERO POWER SO I WAS UNABLE TO TURN MY HAZARD LIGHTS ON OR PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL TO ROLL TO THE BREAKDOWN LANE (SEE ATTACHED PICTURE).  I THEN HAD TO EXIT THE JEEP INTO ONCOMING RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC IN THE LEFT LANE AND LUCKILY MADE IT SAFETY TO THE SHOULDER WHERE I CALLED 911 AND TRIPLE A FOR A TOW.  THE JEEP WAS TOWED TO MY LOCAL MECHANIC WHO SAID THE ALTERNATOR FAILED AND THAT HE HAD TO UNPLUG IT FROM THE BATTERY SINCE IT WAS STILL PRODUCING EXCESSIVE HEAT HOURS AFTER IT ARRIVED THERE.  I THEN CALLED THE FCA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND REFERENCED RECALL T36, SINCE THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED AS THE DESCRIPTION PROVIDED (ALTHOUGH I DID NOT HAVE ANY RECALLS ON MY VIN). THEY PUT ME IN TOUCH WITH THE LOCAL JEEP DEALERSHIP TO SET UP AN APPT SO I PAID FOR ANOTHER TOW THERE. THE NEXT DAY I RECEIVE A CALL FROM THE SERVICE DEPT THAT MY ALTERNATOR FAILED, WHICH DRAINED MY BATTERY, WHICH BROKE MY MODULE POWERTRAIN CONTROL COMPUTER TOTALING $2,134 IN REPAIRS.  THEY CANNOT CONFIRM NOR DENY THAT MY JEEP IS PART OF RECALL T36, BUT REGARDLESS SINCE MY VIN DOES NOT HAVE ANY RECALLS ON IT, THAT I HAVE TO PAY IN FULL AND THAT IF DOWN THE ROAD THERE IS A RECALL THAT I WILL GET REIMBURSED.  I THEN CALL THE FCA CUSTOMER SERVICE BACK AND THEY CHECK THEIR INTERNAL SYSTEM AND CONFIRM THAT I AM NOT PART OF RECALL T36 AND THERE ARE NO OUTSTANDING RECALLS FOR MY JEEP.
THE ALTERNATOR ON OUR JEEP HAD THE SAME ISSUE AS THE P60 RECALL FOR THIS MODEL YEAR AND ENGINE EQUIPPED WITH THE 160 AMP ALTERNATOR. OUR VEHICLE HAS THE 180 AMP ALTERNATOR AND IS NOT COVERED. MY QUESTION/COMPLAINT IS THAT IF THE CHRYSLER WARRANTY REP TOLD ME THAT SHE IS SEEING THIS ISSUE MORE AND MORE THAN WHY ISN'T THE 180 AMP ALTERNATOR COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY ALSO.  THE CAR WAS RUNNING PERFECTLY FINE AND INSTANTLY STARTED SQUEALING VERY LOUDLY AND WE COULD SMELL THE ELECTRICAL ISSUE WE ARE UNSURE OF A FIRE ISSUE BUT IT LOOKED LIKE THE ALTERNATOR COULD HAVE STARTED SOMETHING ELSE..LUCKILY WE WERE ABLE TO PULL THE VEHICLE OVER AND WHEN I LIFTED THE HOOD THE ALTERNATOR WAS POURING OUT SMOKE AND HAD SOOT AROUND THE COOLING FINS. WE RETURNED TO THE VEHICLE 3 HOURS LATER AND WE COULD STILL SMELL THE BURNT WIRE SMELL. OUR DEALER TRIED TO JUMP START USING A POWER PACK AND IT INSTANTLY DRAINED TWO POWER PACKS THAT CAN JUMP SEAMS FROM A DEAD BATTERY.  OUR VEHICLE HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE DEALER. NOW WE ARE WAITING TO FIND OUT WHAT OUR CHARGED WILL BE.  AS I SAID EARLIER, THE CHRYSLER WARRANTY REP SAID THAT THIS IS BEING REPORTED MORE AND MORE AND SHE ADVISED ME TO FILE A COMPLAINT HOPING THAT A RECALL WILL BE STARTED DUE TO THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THEY ARE SEEING.  IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO IN THE MEANTIME WHILE I SPEND 500$ ON A TOW AND A ALTERNATOR?  THANK YOU [XXX]    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).?*JB
MY ALTERNATOR AND THEN MY ECU COMPUTER WERE DAMAGED EXACTLY IN THE SAME WAY THAT WAS DESCRIBED IN THE P60 RECALL.   UNFORTUNATELY I REALIZED THAT MY VIN IS NOT LISTED IN THE RECALL.  HOW CAN I GET REINBURSED FROM THE DEALER  ALL THE EXPENSES THAT I PAID  IF MY VIN IS NOT IN THE RECALL ALTHOUGH IT HAS THE SAME DAMAGED THAT IS DESCRIBED IN THE P60 BULLETIN ,   PLEASE ADVISE    MARCELO
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 45 MPH, THE VEHICLE MADE AN UNUSUAL NOISE. THE VEHICLE WAS PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THE CONTACT NOTICED SMOKE COMING FROM THE ALTERNATOR. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHO DIAGNOSED THAT THE ALTERNATOR FAILED. THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED OF A RECALL; HOWEVER, THE DEALER STATED THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE AND STATED THAT THERE WAS A RECALL. THE FAILURE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE RECALL DETAILS WERE UNKNOWN. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 127,000.
VEHICLE IS AN OVERLAND MODEL WITH 5.7 ENGINE.  AS OF 2-7-17 THE VEHICLE HAS STALLED ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS.  ALL THREE INCIDENTS HAVE BEEN WHILE MAKING LOW SPEED TURNS.  THE ENGINE JUST QUITS WITHOUT SPUTTERING OR ANY TYPE OF WARNING.  ALL DASH LIGHTS REMAIN ON AS IF THE VEHICLE WERE RUNNING.  POWER STEERING GOES OUT AND LOSS OF POWER BRAKES MAKES IT DANGEROUS IN COMPLETING TURNS AND THEN HAVE TO COAST TO A SAFE PLACE.  PLACE CAR IN PARK AND CAR STARTS RIGHT UP LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED.  THE CAR HAS 57,000 MILES ON IT AND HAS NO PREVIOUS ISSUES.  I HAVE NOT TAKEN TO DEALER (YET) AS IT IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY.  I HAVE SEEN OTHER ONLINE POSTS FROM JEEP OWNERS WITH SIMILAR COMPLAINTS AND AM WONDERING IF THIS IS A SAFETY RECALL ISSUE.
CAR LOST ALL POWER FOR STEERING AND BRAKING.  CAR STALLED.  WAS AT LOW SPEED 5-8MPH TURNING TO THE RIGHT INTO A  GAS STATION DRIVEWAY FROM BUSY ROADWAY OF  SPEEDS OF 55MPH.  CAR WENT STRAIGHT AND ROLLED TO A STOP.  GRATEFUL WAS PARKING LOT AND DITCH IN FRONT OF ME AND NOT THE GAS PUMPS OR ANOTHER VEHICLE AS I HAD NO CONTROL OF THE CAR STOPPING.   I HAVE TWICE HAD CAR TO DEALER FOR CAR GOING INTO LIMP MODE. BOTH IN YEAR 2016. SAME CYLANOID EACH TIME.
I HAVEN'T HAD ANY TROUBLE WITH MY CAR. I WAS GOING TO MY DADS WHEN A BATTERY LIGHT POPPED UP. I WAS LESS THAN MILE FROM HIS HOUSE. WHEN I GOT TO HIS HOUSE I CUT THE CAR OFF SO MY DAD COULD CHECK UNDER THE HOOD BUT HE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT. WHEN I CRANKED THE CAR BACK UP MY RADIO WAS CUTTING ON AND OFF, I CUT THE AIR ON LOW AND IT STARTED BLOWED HEAT OUT THE DEFROST, AND THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS START GOING OFF BY THEIRSELVES. I CUT THE CAR OFF AGAIN SO IT WOULD STOP. WHEN I TRIED TO CUT THE CAR BACK ON IT WOULDN'T CRANK. MY DAD HOOKED IT UP TO A BATTERY CHARGER BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THE BATTERY WAS DEAD. WE GOT IT CRANKED AND LEFT HIS HOUSE TO TAKE IT STRAIGHT TO THE JEEP DEALERSHIP. WE GOT ABOUT A MILE DOWN THE RODE AND THE LIGHTS WERE  FLICKERING, THE STEERWHEEL LOCKED UP AND THE CAR CUT OFF. UNDER THE HOOD STARTED SMOKING. WE WERE STRANDED ON THE SIDE OF THE RODE WITH MY 4 YEAR OLD SON IN THE BACK SEAT. WE HAD TWO PEOPLE STOP TO TRY AND JUMP THE BATTERY OFF BUT IT WAS COMPLETELY DEAD. WE CALLED A TOW TRUNK AND THEY TOWED IT TO THERE SHOP. THEY HOOKED UP TO THERE MACHINES AND SAID IT WAS THE ALTERNATOR. NOW I'VE PAID $800 TO GET THE ALTERNATOR REPLACED. WHEN THE ALTERNATOR WENT OUT IT FRIED MY POWER MODULE CONTROL.
YET ANOTHER DEFECTIVE ALTERNATOR.  WAS DRIVING ON CITY ROAD  AND COULD SMELL SOMETHING BURNING IN ENGINE. PULLED OVER AND THOUGHT MY CAR WAS ON FIRE FROM THE AMOUNT OF SMOKE COMING FROM THE ENGINE.  ALTERNATOR LOCKED UP. COULDN'T START VEHICLE AFTER I STOPPED.

ON 9/5/15, I APPLIED MY BRAKES AS I WAS APPROACHING A RED LIGHT AT APPROXIMATELY 40 MPH.  INITIALLY I FELT THE BRAKES GRAB BUT THEN THE BRAKES GAVE OUT CAUSING ME TO SWERVE TO AVOID A CAR IN FRONT OF ME AND THEN USING THE OTHER LANE OF TRAFFIC TO FINALLY GET THE VEHICLE TO STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION BY APPLYING MY EMERGENCY BRAKE.  OBVIOUSLY, QUITE A HARROWING SITUATION FOR MYSELF IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER VEHICLES IN MY PATH ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD.  LUCKILY THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT AND EVEN MORE IMPORTANT, NO INJURIES.    WESTBURY JEEP IN NY (WHERE I SERVICE MY VEHICLE)  TOLD ME THAT THE CAUSE WAS A BAD BRAKE BOOSTER.   THAT TRIGGERED QUESTIONS IN MY MIND AS IN SEPTEMBER OF 2014 I HAD RECALL P14 SERVICED.  IT SEEMS THAT A SHIELD HAD BEEN INSTALLED BUT THAT THE BOOSTER ITSELF HAD NOT BEEN CHANGED.  WHY WASNT THE BOOSTER CHANGED AT THAT TIME?   I NOW HAVE MY DOUBTS THAT THIS WAS PROPERLY AND ADEQUATELY TAKEN CARE OF, PUTTING MY LIFE AND THE LIFE OF OTHERS IN DANGER.  IN RESEARCHING THIS PROBLEM FURTHER, IVE COME ACROSS SEVERAL OTHER CASES MIRRORING MINEQUITE ALARMING.

I RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE IN THE MAIL. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED MY LOCAL JEEP DEALERSHIP TO SEE ABOUT FIXING THE PROBLEM. THIS CALL WAS MADE IN JUNE 2014. IT IS NOW JANUARY 2015 AND NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO FIX THE (NOW THREE) RECALLS I HAVE ON MY JEEP. I KEEP GETTING TOLD I AM "ON THE LIST." THE LAST TIME I CALLED THE MAN IN THE PARTS DEPARTMENT WAS VERY RUDE AND I WAS TOLD THEY "ONLY GET IN ONE PART PER WEEK" AND THERE ARE "OVER 300 PEOPLE ON THE LIST"...THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE! THESE RECALLS HAVE NOT BEEN DEALT WITH IN A TIMELY OR SAFE MANNER. A BRAKE BOOSTER PROBLEM, SUN VISOR WIRING, AND NOW THE ALTERNATOR.. WHO KNOWS WHEN THESE WILL BE FIXED! WITH THESE PROBLEMS I DO NOT FEEL AS SAFE IN MY JEEP, I MAY END UP GETTING RID OF IT IF SOMEONE DOES NOT TAKE THE TIME TO FIX VEHICLES THAT HAVE RECALLS. THIS IS OUR SAFETY, SEND MORE THAN ONE PART PER WEEK SO WE CAN FEEL SAFE IN THE VEHICLE I CHOSE TO BUY!  *TR

ENGINE STALLED WHILE DRIVING ON INTERSTATE CAUSING A NEAR-ACCIDENT.  VEHICLE WAS SUCCESSFULLY RESTARTED SHORTLY THEREAFTER, BUT AFTER RETURNING HOME AND TURNING OFF VEHICLE, FUEL PUMP CONTINUED TO RUN.  THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT START AND HAD TO BE TOWED TO CHRYSLER/JEEP DEALERSHIP.  DEALER REPAIR INVOLVED REPLACING A DEFECTIVE "TOTALLY INTEGRATED POWER MODULE" AT A COST TO ME, THE OWNER, OF $1,200.  THIS INCIDENT VERY CLOSELY MIRRORS MEDIA REPORTS IN LATE SEPTEMBER, 2014, DETAILING SIMILAR INCIDENTS WITH THE SAME VEHICLE.  IN AT LEAST ONE REPORT (CBS-DETROIT; SEPT. 20, 2014; "CHRYSLER RECALLS NEARLY 189,000 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEES, DODGE DURANGOS") CHRYSLER CLAIMS THEIR PENDING RECALL WILL COVER SUV'S BUILT FROM JAN. 25, 2010 THROUGH JULY 20, 2011.  MY VEHICLE, EXHIBITING THE EXACT SAME MALFUNCTIONS, WAS MANUFACTURED IN NOVEMBER, 2011.  CLEARLY THE RECALL SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO CAPTURE MORE VEHICLES WITH FAULTY POWER MODULES.  *TR

MULTIPLE INCIDENTS - STOPPED AT CORNER HEADING UPHILL.  HAPPENED TO TOUCH BOTH BRAKE AND GAS PEDALS AT THE SAME TIME. I FOUND THAT WHEN GOING INTO THE INTERSECTION AT THE CHANGE OF LIGHT, NO GAS (PROPULSION) FOR APPROX. 5 SECONDS.  COMPLAINED TO SERVICE MGR.  HE ADVISED HE HAD HEARD THIS BEFORE AND WOULD CONTACT CHRYSLER.  NEVER HEARD FROM HIM AGAIN.  OVER THE TWO YEARS THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED ABOUT 4 TIMES.

I HAVE A 2012 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE THAT WAS BOUGHT BRAND NEW IN DECEMBER 2011.  IN 2013 I EXPERIENCED MY FIRST INCIDENT WHERE MY JEEP STARTED, RAN FOR 1-2 SECONDS, THEN DIED.  I TRIED MULTIPLE TIMES TO RESTART IT AND COULD NOT GET IT TO RESTART.  I FINALLY DECIDED TO COMPLETELY TURN OFF THE VEHICLE AND START THE IGNITION PROCESS OVER.  THANKFULLY THAT SEEMED TO WORK.  BETWEEN THE FIRST INCIDENT AND THE NEXT SERVICE VISIT (JANUARY 2014), THIS HAPPENED APPROXIMATELY 6-10 TIMES.  I MADE THE DEALER AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND THEY NOTED IT ON THE SERVICE SHEET; HOWEVER THEY TOLD ME THEY SAW NO ERROR CODES AND COULD NOT RECREATE THE PROBLEM.  THE IN FEBRUARY I HAD AN INCIDENT WHERE IT STARTED THEN STALLED, THEN THE SECURITY ALARM SOUNDED.  I HAD TO REMOVE THE PUSH START AND USE THE KEY IN THE IGNITION IN ORDER TO DISENGAGE THE SECURITY SYSTEM.  THEN APPROXIMATELY ONE WEEK LATER I STARTED THE JEEP TO GO TO WORK AND IT DIED AFTER RUNNING FOR 1-2 SECONDS.  I RESTARTED THE IGNITION PROCESS, THIS TIME WHEN I LET GO OF THE PUSH BUTTON START THE STARTER CONTINUED TO CRANK FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 SECONDS, UNTIL I EXITED THE VEHICLE AND LOCKED THE CAR.  NOW IN THE LAST TWO DAYS THE VEHICLE HAS STARTED, RAN FOR 1-2 SECONDS, THEN DIED ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS.    I HAVE MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALER AND SHARED THE ABOVE INFORMATION WITH THEM.  I HAVE ADVISED THEM THAT I THINK I HAVE A BAD TIPM.  I AM HOPING TO GET THIS ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY SINCE I HAVE 33,500 MILES ON THE VEHICLE AND DO NOT WANT THIS TO BE REPLACED AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRES.  I AM SEEING THE AVERAGE COST TO REPLACE THE TIPM AT A DEALER IS $1200-$1400.  THERE ARE ENOUGH SIMILAR STORIES ABOUT THESE SORT OF ISSUES THAT JEEP/CHRYSLER SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL AND STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT.   *TR
THE BATTERY KEEPS DYING/VEHICLE WON'T START/DIES WHILE IDLING. MY JEEP HAS A PUSH BUTTON START, WHEN PUSHED, THE CAR WILL CYCLE THROUGH THE IGNITION PROCESS (ABOUT 15-30 SECONDS) BUT WON'T START. AFTER THAT THE BATTERY IS DRAINED ENOUGH NOT TO CYCLE THROUGH IGNITION PROCESS. THIS FIRST STARTED SHORTLY AFTER ORIGINAL PURCHASE OF VEHICLE AND I HAVE BEEN FORCED  TO KEEP ON A CHARGER, WHICH ONLY WORKS SOME OF THE TIME. I HAVE TO HAVE INSURANCE SEND ROADSIDE TO JUMP CAR AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK. IT HAS ALSO STARTED UP JUST TO DIE AS SOON AS IT IS PUT INTO GEAR, WARM OR COLD. JEEP CLAIMS THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH BATTERY OR ELECTRICAL SYSTEM. THIS IS MY WIFE'S CAR AND I AM WORRIED THAT IT WILL STALL OUT WITH HER AND 2 YEAR OLD SON INSIDE.   *TR

On my way to work and the vehicle stalled. I was able to move the vehicle, however, I reached out for assistance in the recall. Unable to get a dealership to fix the recall.
The contact owns a 2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The contact stated while driving 10 MPH, the vehicle started shuddering. The check engine warning light illuminated. The contact was able to drive to the nearby residence. The contact stated that her husband used an OBD reader to diagnose the vehicle and determined that cylinder #5 was misfiring. The contact stated that her husband replaced the fuel pump relay. The contact stated that after replacing the fuel pump relay, the OBD reader indicated that cylinder #7 was misfiring. The dealer was notified of the failure and informed the contact that the VIN was not included in a recall. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 89,000.
Passenger headrest separated -- turns out it is called "Active Head Restraint" -- I did not know it was even there! The vehicle was not involved in an accident or rear ended (as I understand activates this). Nobody was injured and in fact nobody was in the vehicle when it went off. This happened a few months ago and thought it was just a broken headrest and I would have to fix it. Upon investigating the headrest last week is when I discovered this has been an issue for a long time. I found a "Warranty Bulletin" put out by Mopar BUT it was not issued to owners of the vehicle. I called the Jeep dealer on 3/2/23 and found out that my vehicle went out of the "Warranty Bulletin" time period just last month. I missed the repair because I was not notified of the issue from Jeep / Mopar! After reading of other individuals occurrences and injuries I have disconnected the "AHR" from the driver seat because of the possibility of it activating when my daughter is driving the vehicle and causing her to loose control of the vehicle. This item failing is more dangerous to drivers & passengers than other items which have been recalled by the NHTSA because this can cause an accident with death potential vs like a leaking fuel line that would cause a fire and loss of the vehicle but most likely not a death because the person would be able to exit the vehicle.
A letter was sent during Covid lockdown that my Jeep may have an issue with the dash and wrinkling of material.  I called when I felt safe to come in and Southpoint Dealership in Tulsa, OK told me that it was only offered for a short period of time and that this could no longer be addressed. It is distracting to have the bunching of leather in my view while driving. Apparently other vehicles are having similar issues. Why was this only allowed to be addressed during Covid Lockdown?  I did take it to the dealership, and they took images of the material bunching on the dash.  Nothing was done for it.  Currently my car is at Southpoint (last two weeks for one recall). I can take images when I get it back if you would like.
The vehicle engine stalls while driving. The electrical remains on, however the engine stalls. My safety is put in risk because this happens while driving on the highway and normal streets. I have taken it to the dealer (Glendale Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram 10070 Manchester Road, St. Louis, Mo. 63122 (3140 965-5100) they claimed to have never heard of this issue, but informed me there was a recall on the Fuel Pump Relay. They replaced, however the issue continues and they claim they cannot figure out the problem. I did receive a letter from FCA-Fiat Chrysler Automobiles regarding the recal-P54(NHTSA14V-530) or safety recall R09 (NHTSA 15V-115). The engine will re-start after about 15 minutes and drives fine until the next time it stalls, which has become more frequent.    There is no warning when the engine will stall, it just stops running.  This problem has been going on now for over a year with the stalling becoming more frequent.

THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE ISSUE. THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE. PARTS DISTRIBUTION DISCONNECT.
HAD A RECALL V62 PERFORMED ON FEB 1, 2021. PRIOR TO THAT DATE FOR THE LAST 14 MONTHS, I HAD ZERO PROBLEMS. NOW AUTO SHUTS OFF WHEN PLACED IN GEAR AND ON ONE OCCASION STARTED REMOTELY AND THE ENGINE WOULD NOT COME ON NORMAL MODE TO DRIVE. AFTER A FEW TRIES VEHICLE STARTED AND WAS ABLE TO DRIVE.
JEEP SPUTTERED DURING A RED LIGHT. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ILLUMINATED. HEAD CYLINDER FAILURE AT 66 THOUSAND MILES. ENGINE MADE TICKING NOISE. BROUGHT TO JEEP REPAIR IN MASS. DIAGNOSED AND REPAIRED LEFT HEAD CYLINDER. STARED OTHER VINS HAD RECALLS, MY JEEP WASN'T INCLUDED. SAME FAILURE AS OTHER RECALLED ENGINES, THEY DID REPAIR AFTER ENGINE LEAKING AS WELL AND TRANSMISSION LINE FAILURES AT 66K MILES
I HAD CRUISE AT 80MPH ON INTERSTATE HIGHWAY AND DISENGAGED ON EXIT RAMP BY USING THE BRAKE. THE CAR SLOWED BUT I USED BRAKE AGAINN TO YIELD ONTO 4 LANE ROAD AND AGAIN TO CROSS OVER 2 LANES INTO A GAS STATION. I PULLED UP TO PUMP SLOWLY. WHEN I PUT THE BRAKE ON AGAIN TO COMPLETTE THE STOP,THE CRUISE REENGAGED AND THE CAR TOOK OFF. LUCKILY THERE WAS OPEN PARKING SPOT,I AIMED THERE AND CAR JUST KEPT GOING. OVER A CURB, THROUGH ABOUT 75 YARDS OF GRASS AND INTO A FIELD,ABOUT 25 FEET IN. NO BRAKING EVEN THO I TRIED. IN THE BRUSH WAS A CONCRETE BLOCK I HIT THAT CAUSED BOTH PASSENGER TIRES TO BLOW AND THEN THE CAR SLOWED AND WENT TO THE LEFT SOME 5 FEET AND STOPPED. NO AIRBAGS DEPLOYED. I ONLY PLOWED DOWN SMALL BRUSH AND MISSED A TREE IN MY PATH WHEN CAR VEERED LEFT AFTER TIRES BLEW. IT WAS A DRY SUNNY MORNING WITH NO ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS. I HAD ONLY BEEN DRIVING FOR AN HOUR AND HAD STOPPED TO GET GAS AND USE RESTROOM. THEPA STATE TROOPERS CAME BUT SINCE NO DAMAGE TO OTHER PROPERTY AND NO INJURIES, THEY DID NOT FILE A REPORT. USAA INSURANCE NOTIFIED AT ONCE AND TOOK THE CAR. THEY CLAIM IT AS A TOTAL LOSS. I AM BLESSED TO BE OK BUT THIS CRUISE/BRAKE MALFUNCTION COULD HAVE BEEN DEADLY ANYWHERE ELSE. I HOPE YOU WILL INVESTIGATE I WOULD NOT WANT ANYONE ELSE TO EXPERIENCE THIS

HE HAD TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO THE SAME DEALER PRIOR WHERE HE WAS INFORMED THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE MATTER OR REPAIR THE VEHICLE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 80,000.
INTERMITTENTLY THE BRAKE PEDAL WILL BE VERY STIFF WHEN STARTING THE VEHICLE AND BACKING OUT. AFTER A FEW MILES IT WILL EASE UP. BUT IF A SUDDEN STOP IS NEEDED IT IS HARD TO PUSH DOWN AGAIN. OTHER TIMES IT FUNCTIONS NORMALLY. I NOTICED THIS ON THE TEST DRIVE OF THE VEHICLE BUT THE DEALER SAID THEY DIDN'T SEE ANY ISSUES I BOUGHT THIS CAR AROUND MARCH OF 2019. THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN ONGOING INTERMITTENTLY
THE DAMAGES DIRECTLY CAUSED BY THE ALTERNATOR RECALL DIRECTLY RELATED TO MY 2013 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE ARE BEING DECLINED TO BE COVERED BY DEALERSHIP IN A VACAVILLE CALIFORNIA. THEY ARE WANTING TO CHARGE ME $1000 FOR DAMAGES TO MY VEHICLE THAT WERE CAUSED BY ALTERNATOR ISSUE.
VEHICLE IS STATIONARY AND NOT ON. WHEN I SIT IN THE VEHICLE AND PUT MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE TO PRESS THE START BUTTON THE VEHICLE ONLY HALF CRANKS AND THE ELECTRIC ONLY TURNS ON. IT TAKES A FEW TRIES AFTER TURNING POWER OFF AND OPENING THE DOOR UNTIL IT WILL ACTUALLY START FULLY.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE OCCASIONALLY FAILED TO START AND ALL THE INDICATORS ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL ILLUMINATED.

I PURCHASED A USED 2013 JEEP 2 YEARS AGO AT NOVAK MOTORS IN FARMINGDALE, NY. THEY TOLD ME I NEEDED TO GO TO A JEEP DEALERSHIP TO GET THE BRAKE RECALL TAKEN CARE OF.  I TRIED CALLING THE CLOSEST JEEP DEALERSHIP TO MY WORK LOCATION AT 642 W MAIN STREET, RIVERHEAD, NY AND SPOKE WITH MARTHA? IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TODAY AND SHE SAID IT WOULD BE SEVERAL WEEKS BEFORE THE NEXT AVAILABLE APPOINTMENT.  WHEN I ASKED HER IF I HAVE WARRANTY WORK, AN OPEN CAMPAIGN THAT NEEDED TO BE FIXED, WOULD I BE ABLE TO GET IN SOONER?  THE WOMAN THEN REPLIED TO ME THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER ACCEPTING ANY NEW CUSTOMERS AT ALL!
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. THE CONTACT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBERS: 15V879000 (ELECTRICAL SYSTEM, INTERIOR LIGHTING), 17V435000 (ELECTRICAL SYSTEM), AND 17V572000 (SERVICE BRAKES, SERVICE BRAKES, HYDRAULIC). WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 15 MPH, THE ALTERNATOR INDICATOR ILLUMINATED AND THE VEHICLE LOST POWER AND SHUT DOWN. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO MALL OF GEORGIA CHRYSLER, DODGE, JEEP (4345 BUFORD DR, BUFORD, GA 30518, 770-945-0839) WHERE THE DEALER PROVIDED OPTIONS TO REPAIR THE FAILURE WITH AN AFTERMARKET PART OR WAIT FOR TWO WEEKS FOR FULL RECALL REPAIRS. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 155,000. PARTS DISTRIBUTION DISCONNECT.
WHEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE EVERY SINGLE THING TURNED ON. WINDSHEILD WIPERS, EVERY LIGHT ON THE DASH BOARD LIGHT UP LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE, ENGINE STARTED TO REV UP, THE DASH BOARD WAS GOING UP AND DOWN WITH THE SPEED. EVERYTHING WAS GOING AND IT WAS STRANGE.
WHEN YOU PUSH THE IGNITION BUTTON, THE ENGINE CRANKS BUT IT WON'T START. IT TAKES A FEW ATTEMPTS BEFORE THE VEHICLE ACTUALLY STARTS. AFTER IT STARTS YOU START TO DRIVE IT AND THE IT STALLS AS YOU ARE DRIVING IT. THIS HAPPENS MOSTLY WHEN THE ENGINE IS COLD (MORNINGS OR AFTER IT HASN'T BEEN USED FOR SEVERAL HOURS). AFTER RESEARCHING IT THERE IS A FUEL PUMP RELAY RECALL ON SAME MODEL AND YEAR AS MINE. THE RECALL IS FOR THE FUEL PUMP RELAY.. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS WHEN DRIVING THE HEHE VEHICLE AS IT STALLS AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT.
WHILE DRIVING MY 2013 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE ON A BUSY 4 LANE HIGHWAY MY ALTERNATOR FAILED, RESULTING IN THE ENGINE STALLING.  I  HAD NO STEERING, NO BRAKES, NO CONTROL OVER THE CAR WHATSOEVER.  FORTUNATELY I WAS GOING UP A HILL AND THE CAR CAME TO A STOP WITHOUT ANYONE BEING INJURED!  I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.  THE DEALER IS SAYING THAT RECALL P60 - WHICH COVERS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAR - DOES NOT COVER MY CAR BECAUSE I HAVE A 180 AMP ALTERNATOR INSTEAD OF A 160 AMP, WHICH IS COVERED BY THE RECALL.  HOW CAN CHRYSLER GROUP LIMIT THE RECALL BY THE AMPS WHEN CLEARLY THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO WITH MY 2013 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE??
ON SATURDAY 3/11/2017 I ATTEMPTED TO BACK MY JEEP DOWN AND OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY. I IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THAT THE BRAKES FELT STRANGE, AND THAT AS I DEPRESSED THE PEDAL THE JEEP WAS NOT STOPPING. CONFUSED, I HIT THE E-BRAKE TO STOP THE JEEP AND ATTEMPTED TO PUMP THE BRAKE PEDAL SEVERAL TIMES TO SEE IF THERE WAS RESISTANCE. THE PEDAL FELT BETTER, BUT I COULD HEAR A HISING SOUND, LIKE A VACUUM LEAK. I WENT ON LINE AND SAW THAT THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THE BRAKE SYSTEM FOR MY VEHICLE, WHICH COINCIDENTALLY WAS THE SAME PROBLEM I HAD EXPERIENCED. WHAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WAS THAT THE RECALL MENTIONED WATER INTRUSION INTO THE BRAKE BOOSTER AND THE POTENTIAL FOR FREEZING AND REDUCING THE BRAKING EFFECTIVENESS. I LIVE IN PITTSBURGH, PA, AND FOR 3 DAYS PRIOR TO MY BRAKE ISSUE IT HAD BEEN RAINY, AND MILD. FRIDAY NIGHT 3/10, THE TEMPERATURE DROPPED AND SATURDAY MORNING 3/11 IT WAS 20 DEG F. I CANT HELP BUT THINK THE TEMPERATURE, AND MOISTURE PLAYED A ROLE IN THIS INCIDENT. I'M JUST GLAD IT HAPPENED RIGHT AWAY INSTEAD OF ONCE I GOT OUT INTO TRAFFIC. THE JEEP IS CURRENTLY AT JEEP IN MOON TOWNSHIP, PA FOR TROUBLESHOOTING. ...UPDATED 04/11/17 *BF  ..UPDATED 06/06/17 *BF  *AS
POWER STEERING MAKING NOISE LOUD , HAD IT CHECKED OUT AND DEALERSHIP TELLS ME ALL 2013 DOES THIS. WELL A WEEK LATER AFTER THEY LOOKED AT I LOST POWER STEERING WITH A BABY IN CAR.
MY VEHICLE HAS 4 OPEN RECALLS AS LISTED BELOW.  I HAVE PRESENTED IT MANY MONTHS AGO TO TWO DIFFERENT JEEP DEALERS, DICK MYERS, HARRISONBURG, VA AND BILLY BENDER, CUMBERLAND, MD (WHERE I PURCHASED IT).  AT BOTH DEALERSHIPS, THEY CLAIMED A NATIONAL BACKLOG FOR RECALL PARTS AND THAT THEY WOULD ORDER THEM AND CALL ME.  I HAVE NEVER HEARD FROM ANYONE.  I SUSPICION THAT THIS IS A FINANCIAL DECISION BY JEEP, NOT THE DEALERSHIPS.  I THINK THEY ARE DELAYING, HOPING TO NOT HAVE TO MAKE THESE REPLACEMENTS.  I WANT TO DECLARE THE JEEP A LEMON DUE TO THIS AND FORCE THEM TO BUY IT BACK SINCE THEY CAN'T SEEM TO FIX IT.  I WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO PUT SOME TEETH IN THESE RECALLS.  WHAT GOOD ARE THEY IF THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE REPAIRED?

I WAS DRIVING MY 2013 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE ON A CITY STREETWHEN MY EYES AND THROAT STARTED BURNING. MY 10 MONTH OLD INFANT BEGAN TO CRY AS I REALIZED SMOKE WAS FILING THE CABIN. I PANICKED, AND PULLED OVER, TURNED OFF THE CAR AND IMMEDIATELY TOOK MY BABY OUT OF THE CAR. WE REMAINED IN THE SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR ASSISTANCE. I CONTINUED SEEING SMOKE COMING OUT OF THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY CAR. WHEN ASSISTANCE ARRIVED, I REALIZED THE RIGHT VISOR HAD CAUGHT ON FIRE AND A RESULT WAS BURNED WITH A BLACK HOLE. I TOOK MY JEEP TO THE DEALERSHIP ON JANUARY 6, 2015 TO GET IT SERVICED FOR RECALL P 36, WHICH IS RELATED TO THE SUN VISOR WIRING. I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP, THAT THE RECALL HAD BEEN COMPLETED. I CONTACTED CHYRSLER CUSTOMER SUPPORT  AFTER MY JEEP WAS ON FIRE AND FILED A COMPLAINT. THE REPRESENTATIVE WAS SO RUDE AND TOLD ME IT WOULD TAKE 2-3 BUSINESS DAYS TO GET MY CASE REVIEWED. THIS WAS NOT A SURPRISE, AS I HAVE DEALT WITH CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE PAST AND HAVE NEVER HAD A GOOD EXPERIENCE.  I FEARED FOR MY SAFETY AS WELL THE SAFETY OF MY INFANT. I REFUSE TO DRIVE THAT CAR, AND WAS TOLD BY THE CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE THAT I SHOUKD TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP. WHY THEY WOULD SUGGEST THAT ? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T FEEL SAFE AND NOW I AM CAR LESS AS I WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO REVIEW MY CASE.

TONIGHT A SIMILAR SITUATION HAPPENED. THE KEYLESS FOB WAS IN A PURSE ON THE PASSENGER SEAT OF THE VEHICLE. AS MY WIFE EXITED THE VEHICLE, THE DOORS WERE SOMEHOW LOCKED. SHE WAS UNABLE TO OPEN THE DOORS FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE. LUCKILY, AGAIN, THERE WAS SOMEONE OF AGE THAT COULD OPEN THE DOORS. HOWEVER, I HAVE A 2 YEAR OLD SON THAT IS NORMALLY IN HIS CAR SEAT, AND WOULD HAVE NO POSSIBILITY TO EXIT THE VEHICLE IN THIS CONDITION, AND THIS IS LIFE THREATENING AS WE LIVE IN A HOT CLIMATE, ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMER TIME.     MY NEXT EMAIL AND PHONE CALL IS WITH NHTSA. THIS IS 100% UNACCEPTABLE AND YOU HAVE TAKEN MY CONCERNS LIGHTLY. WHEN THERE IS THE FIRST FATALITY DUE TO THIS ISSUE, THERE WILL BE MAJOR CONSEQUENCES TO CHRYSLER. I WILL DISCUSS THIS WITH NHTSA.

AFTER DRIVING TO WORK 29 MILES WHILE WAITING FOR DAY SHIFT TO GET OUT SO I CAN GET A PARKING SPOT WHILE IN PARK WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING FOR AROUND 15 MINUTES I THEN  PUT IT IN DRIVE WITH MY FOOT PRESSED VERY HARD ON THE  BRAKE PEDAL THE ENGINE REVS UP TO A VERY HIGH RPMS AND MY JEEP MOVES FORWARD EVEN THOUGH I HAVE ALL MY PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE AND I AM A MALE AT 210 POUNDS. THIS HAS HAPPENED OVER A DOZEN TIMES SINCE I HAVE OWNED THIS VEHICLE. I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE BRAND NEW AND THE DEALER I BOUGHT IT FROM SAYS THEY CAN NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG. IT IS GOING BACK TO THE DEALER MONDAY 2/23/2015 AGAIN FOR THIS PROBLEM AND TO REPLACE A SHOCK. THE LAST TIME THEY SAID ALL THEY COULD FIND WAS THAT THE TRANY FLUID WAS LOW NOT SURE WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH MY PROBLEM. ANYWAY I REALLY LOVE MY JEEP HOWEVER THIS IS A VERY DANGERS PROBLEM. I WORK AT CHRYSLER SECOND SHIFT AND WHEN DAY SHIFT LETS OUT THERE ARE OVER 100 WORKERS LEAVING AND IF MY FOOT WAS NOT PRESSED FIRMLY ON THE BRAKE I COULD HAVE HIT ONE OF THEM.

The contact owns a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The contact stated while driving 35 MPH, the contact became aware that the vehicle was leaking oil. The contact stated that while the vehicle was stationary, the vehicle started to leak coolant. The coolant level warning light was illuminated with an audible chime. The vehicle was driven to an independent mechanic; however, the vehicle was not diagnosed. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer and the dealer were not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 168,000.
The seat belt does not retract as it should.  I have already had it replaced once and I have a second that is failing now.  We have not been in an accident to see if it is a problem with restraining you as a driver, but it is a point of concern.  The dealer replaced the first one, right after we purchased the vehicle, and it is exhibiting similar symptoms now of not retracting after unbuckled.  You can manually align it to get it to feed back, but this doesn't seem to be the correct way to handle this.

I have Grand Cherokee SRT 2014 I am from Saudi Arabia. I was driving my vehicle in the right lane at a speed of 40 miles. There was a vehicle in the second lane that swerved onto my vehicle and forced me to crash into a light pole.  The airbags did not deploy as the vehicle stopped due to the impact and not the brakes.  I was hit while driving, and because I was wearing the seat belt, my rib cage muscles and other injuries were torn. Please investigate and help me. I have never got any fault in regard air bags even after the access ther is no fault light .

Car shut down and engine stalled while driving. I coasted to a stop in the middle of traffic. Car would not restart. Had to get towed home. There are two open recalls on this vehicle- one for fuel pump and one for tone wheel. The dealers say they can’t fix it because no parts are available. This is unacceptable. One recall has been issued over a year ago. This is my primary vehicle. I have already had to borrow a family members vehicle for weeks now. I cannot wait months hoping for parts to become available. I need recall work to be performed now or at least a temporary fix to get me back on the road.

The outstanding recalls have not be addressed despite one of them being over a year old at this time.  The V46 High Pressure Fuel Pump issue is particularly worrying as not only does this pump failure result in a dangerous situation on the road but can also cause tens of thousands of dollars in engine damage as a result.  The recall was issued more than one year ago and no remedy yet exists.  This is not acceptable timeline.  FCA & Stellantis need to either find a remedy of purchase these vehicles back at a fair price immediately as many of us are afraid to drive them with our families.
the vehicle is beginning to choke when accelerating - loss of power is noticed. the engine light is on.  This recall was issued in June of 2022.  here we are almost a year later, and there are still no parts for repair??  Why?
Transmission jerking and slipping until I reach 38mph. Unsafe on roadways feels like being hit from behind. Scary
Fuel pump relay has failed. It is internal and soldered onto the tipm board under the fuse block. This is a well known issue and a cheap fix on 2011 - 2013 models of jeep grand cherokees. The fix was to wire in an external bypass relay. My only option at this point is to replace the tipm board which is quite expensive, hundreds of dollars, for a $8 failed relay....terrible design. Thankfully I wasnt traveling 70 mph on the expressway when the failure occurred, (stall/lose power). Please extend this recall thru the 2015 models
The dashboard of the vehicle has delaminated, with the leather covering bubbling and warping. The uneven surface causes significant glare at certain sun angles to be reflected into the eyes of the driver. The dealership has inspected the vehicle and noted that Jeep had briefly extended the warrenty on the component due to known issues, but refuses to honor a repair or replacement outside of that warrenty period. The vehicle was purchased in this condition so it is unclear when the damage occurred.
While sitting in my car with with it running in a parking spot my passenger side active headrest retention system failed and the headrest deployed violently. Luckily no one was sitting in the passenger seat however this could have caused serious injury of death had the seat been occupied. Upon further investigation by myself I noticed that the metal retention bar was still in place however the plastics that is supposed to secure the bar to the mechanism the bar has broken
With less than 16,000 miles, the driver side seat belt just stopped recoiling. Wife stated one day when she got back from running errands, she unbuckled the seat belt after driving and heard a click noise and the seat belt did not retract. Ever since then the seat does not retrack and whenever someone drives the car, they need to ensure the seat belt is placed within the car so it does not get caught in the door being closed. This will only work for so long until it gets caught in the door before the belt gets frayed and is degraded.
The air ride suspension failed and is available for inspection. The "Service Air Suspension Immediately" notification appeared while driving. The problem has been confirmed by Stellantis dealership. The components were inspected by the manufacturer and insurance. There was not an indication of failure prior to failing. Stellantis technician claims the air suspension experienced an electrical failure causing an internal leak on all (4) air bags. The only remedy is to replace the entire suspension system. I do not know the safety implications of this failure if I continued driving the vehicle.
The contact owns a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The contact stated while moving off from a stop sign, the vehicle inadvertently shifted into neutral and the vehicle stopped independently.

While driving on the freeway at normal speed limit the vehicle has on 2 separate occasions gone into neutral without the driver touching anything. we have taken the vehicle in twice to dealership who have tried to replicate the symptom. They have kept and driven car on multiple occasions with no success .  They tell us they cannot fix the problem without a code if they cannot find it. i have called jeep customer service multiple times and they filed a case number but refuse to get back to me when i leave messages. Jeep Cherokee model 2014 had 81000 recalls for a transmission software issue but not the Grand Cherokee model. This vehicle is clearly very dangerous to drive and my son who was driving nearly had a very serious accident when this happened. What am i to do. i cannot let anyone drive this vehicle . Jeep are not interested in helping the dealership get to the bottom of this issue. i cannot sell the vehicle knowing there is a critical issue with the safety of the vehicle and if someone buys it and gets hurt or killed i probably have a liability. The dealership keeps trying to find it but it may not happen again for weeks or months, like looking for a needle in a haystack. case number with Jeep is 81105546 Please help i am at a loss what to do. We have not used the vehicle since the last incident
driver seat heard rest deployed and cannot be reset. this almost caused a serious accident

The EGR cooler was not properly installed by the manufacturer which has caused several failures to the vehicles engine components (such as oil cooler, engine coolant system, and the EGR itself).   Additionally, the EGR cooler has an active safety recall due to risk of engine explosion and vehicle fire. The parts and remedy for this recall have been available since November.  This repair is covered under BOTH the active recall as well as an extended emissions warranty that was required by a federal judge in the settlement agreement for the emissions scandal which FCA settled with the federal courts to provide remedies to its customers. Thus far,  FCA has not honored the terms of this federally required extended emissions warranty on two separate occasions.   I have contacted three separate dealers and FCA on two occasions. FCA has refused to assist in the EGR repairs and the dealers have refused to perform the repairs.   I’ve not been able to get any assistance from FCA, or the dealers. My EGR cooler is a safety risk and this should be addressed immediately. I have been working to get this resolved with Jeep since March 12th. I need the law to be enforced.

I NOTICED AN OIL LEAK,THROUGH A LITTLE RESEARCH I THOUGHT IT WAS THE OIL COOLER/OIL FILTER ADAPTER. I TOOK IT TO A SHOP AND THEY CONFIRMED IT BUT TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS A NATIONWIDE BACK ORDER ON THE PART. I WAS TOLD THAT 37,000 UNITS ARE ON BACK ORDER. I FEEL THAT THERE IS DEFINITELY A PROBLEM WITH THIS PART, I THINK THAT OIL LEAKS COULD LEAD TO POSSIBLE SAFETY ISSUES AND POSSIBLE DAMAGE TO THE ENGINE
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:    I AM A SRT OWNER WHO LOVES HIS TRUCK, BUT NOT HAPPY WITH THE DESIGN OF THE 6.4 HEMI ENGINE. AS ONE OF THE HIGHEST COSTING JEEPS IN YOUR LINE UP I WOULD ASSUME I WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH IT AFTER 77,000 MILES. UNFORTUNATELY, MY ENGINE HAD LIFTER FAILURE WHICH DESTROYED MY ENGINE. THIS HAPPENED ON THE THROGGS NECK BRIDGE WHILE I WAS DRIVING WITH MY FAMILY. UPON FURTHER RESEARCH I'VE FOUND HUNDREDS OF OTHER SRT OWNERS SUFFERED THE SAME PROBLEM INCURRING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IF THEY DIDN'T BLOW THEIR ENGINE FROM THE FLAW OF THE DESIGN OF THE ENGINE. AT THIS POINT HOW IS THERE NOT A RECALL? DOES IT TAKE A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT BECAUSE THIS IS UNHEARD OFF.

MY 2014 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE WAS LESS THAN 6 YEARS OLD AND WITH 50,000 MILES ON IT IN JULY OF 2020... THE DRIVER SIDE ACTIVE HEADREST RESTRAINT DEPLOYED WHILE THE CAR WAS PARKED AND TURNED OFF.  I WAS IN THE DRIVER SEAT TALKING TO MY SON WHO WAS IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT, AND WE WERE WAITING FOR SOMEONE.  MY HEAD WAS SUDDENLY SNAPPED FORWARD AT THE SAME TIME A LOUD BANG OCCURRED.   I WAS SHOCKED BY THE INCIDENT AND REALIZED HOW LUCKY I WAS THAT I HAD NOT BEEN DRIVING, AS THIS SURELY COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  AT THAT POINT, THE CAR WAS VIRTUALLY UNDRIVEABLE AS IT PUSHED MY HEAD SO FAR FORWARD.  I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I CALLED THE DEALER TO HEAR THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL ON THIS DEFECTIVE SITUATION.  I THEN REALIZED MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM, AND YET CHRYSLER HAS DONE NOTHING TO RECALL THIS.  I THINK THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE, MADE WORSE BY THE FACT THAT THEY OBVIOUSLY KNOW THIS AND STILL ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING TO REMEDY IT.
I STARTED RECEIVING THIS ERROR JUST AFTER THE 'RECALL FIX' FOR THE SHIFTER. NOW IT GOES ON WHILE DRIVING AND SHIFTING. THEY WANTED $180 JUST TO EVALUATE THE PROBLEM EVEN THOUGH I TOLD JEEP SERVICE THE ISSUE IS THEIR FAULT.
WHILE DRING IN MY HOMETOWN AT ABOUT 30 MPH THE TRANSMISSION STARTED JERKING AND I NOTICED SMOKE FROM UNDER THE HOOD. THE CAUSE WAS LATER DETERMINED TO BE A HYDRAULIC FILLED MOTOR MOUNT BREAKING ON DRIVERS SIDE AND LANDING ON EXHAUST PIPE.

I IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT  TO JEEP AND THE GUY TOLD ME THAT IF I DIDNT GET IN A ACCIDENT, MY HEADREST SHOULD HAVE NOT DEPLOYED. THEN PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THAT IT WOULD COST ME CLOSE TO 500.00 TO GET A NEW ONE. I'VE MAINTAIN MY TRUCK AND TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT. I HAVE TWO NIECES THAT IS ALWAYS WITH ME AND THANK GOD THEY WERE NOT RIDING WITH ME TODAY. NOW I HAVE TO THINK WHILE DRIVING IS MY DRIVER SIDE HEADREST GOING TO DO THE SAME.

WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE STREET, THE PASSENGER ACTIVE  HEADREST STRUCK OUR PASSENGER IN THE HEAD.  NOT ONLY DID THIS CAUSE PHYSICAL PAIN, IT IS ALSO ALARMING THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL REGARDING THIS. A SIMPLE GOOGLE SEARCH ELICITS HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS, YET FCA AND JEEP HAVE NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO FIX THIS.    IT'S CLEAR THAT OUR JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE SUFFERS FROM THE VERY COMMON PROBLEM OF BROKEN PLASTIC WHICH RELEASES THE ACTIVE HEADREST.  UTTERLY APPALLED THAT NHTSA AND FCA ARE AWARE OF THIS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION AND YET CHOOSE TO DO NOTHING.  INITIAL RESEARCH IS SHOWING THIS WILL COST ME OVER $600 TO FIX.  *TR

THE HEADREST "DEPLOYED" ON ME WHILE DRIVING, BOPPING ME IN THE HEAD. I DON'T KNOW HOW OR WHAT TO GET THAT FIXED UNDER. THE VEHICLE WAS IN REGULAR LOW SPEED MOTION PULLING THROUGH A PARKING LOT. I BELIEVE THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW IN THE HEADREST THAT CAUSED CLIPS TO BREAK AND THEREFORE HIT ME IN THE HEAD. I BELIEVE THIS MAY BE A HUGE SAFETY RISK FOR THOSE WHO DON'T LEAN AS FAR AS I DO OR EVEN USE THE HEADREST. ALSO I WAS MOVING AT LESS THAN 5 MILES PER HOUR, THIS COULD BE A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE IF SOMEONE WAS MOVING AT A MUCH FASTER VELOCITY. I ALSO DON'T KNOW HOW THIS DEVICE WORKS OR IF ITS LIKE AN AIRBAG, AM I AT RISK IF IT RE-DEPLOYS IN THE ACTUAL CASE OF AN ACCIDENT?

AFTER THE WIPERS ARE TRIGGERED THEN THE NEXT MESSAGE WILL SAY "UNTIL YOU REACH A DESIRED LOCATION YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SHIFT AGAIN UNTIL SERVICED".  NEXT ANOTHER RANDOM MESSAGE WILL APPEAR AND THEN THE SCREEN WILL GO BLANK.  THIS INCLUDES ALL DIGITAL FUNCTIONS OF THE DASH.  SUCH AS SPEEDOMETER, FUEL GAUGE, TACHOMETER, ETC.  SERVICE ENGINE WARNING LIGHTS ARE THE ONLY THING THAT WILL APPEAR.  THE LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED ON AUG. 2, 2019 THE CAR WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO SHIFT INTO PARK OR TURN THE CAR OFF. I HAD TO PUT ON THE EMERGENCY BRAKE AND GET UNDER THE HOOD WHERE THE FUSE PANEL IS LOCATED AND PULL THE IGNITION FUSE TO DISABLE THE CAR.    WE HAVE OFFICIALLY BEEN TO BYERS CHRYSLER LLC. 7 TIMES AND HAVE AN ONGOING COMMUNICATION CASE WITH A CORPORATE JEEP CARE ASSOCIATE.   WE HAVE MUTIPLE VIDEOS THAT CAN BE SEEN OF THE ACTIONS OF THE CAR.  THREE TIMES THE CAR HAS BEEN RETURNED TO US WITH NOTHING DONE EXCEPT CLEARING THE ERROR CODES IT GENERATES WHILE THIS OCCURS.  IT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE AND IS NOW AT THE POINT WHERE IT WILL NOT SAFELY PARK AND TURN OFF.  THE IMAGE I AM INCLUDING STATES THE THE CAR SHOULD BE SHUT OFF TO ENGAGE PARK BUT IT WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO THIS. I HAVE TO PULL THE FUSE WHILE THE CAR IS STILL IN GEAR AND RUNNING WITH THE PARKING BRAKE ON.  THIS IS AS UNSAFE AS IT CAN GET AND THERE IS NO CLUE WHY THIS IS HAPPENING.  WE HAVE CURRENTLY SPENT $1600 TO FIX THE PROBLEM AND HAVE HAD NO REMEDY.
I HAVE A SERVICE SHIFTER LIGHT COMING ON CONSTANTLY AS WELL AS SOME RANDOM RADIO STATION CHANGES.  IT ALL STARTED AFTER LAST RECALL WAS FIXED.  I LOVE MY JEEP BUT AM SO FRUSTRATED.
MY VEHICLE HAS A LONG CRANK BUT WILL NOT TURN OVER. STUCK NUMEROUS TIMES. THE DEALER SAID THEY CAN'T FIND THE PROBLEM BUT I SEE ONLINE THAT EARLIER MODELS WERE RECALLED FOR THE SAME PROBLEM. IT WAS SAID A FAULTY FUEL PUMP RELAY. AM WONDERING IF THIS IS THE SAME PROBLEM.
WHILE DRIVING LOST POWER STEERING. VEHICLE WAS IN A PARKING LOT  WHEN THIS OCCURRED.
SERVICE KEYLESS ENTRY.  AFFECTING MANY JEEP GC MODELS.  I WAS LEFT STRANDED.
PASSENGER SIDE SEAT BELT TENSIONER/RETRACTION MECHANISM BROKE, DRIVERS SIDE IS ON ITS WAY OUT. CAR HAS 40K MILES ON IT. 700 PER SIDE TO FIX OUT OF WARRANTY. SHOULD BE RECALLED. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN. WILL NEVER BUY FROM FCA AGAIN UNLESS THIS IS RECALLED/REMEDIED.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 45 MPH, THE BATTERY SAVE MODE ALARM SOUNDED, THE STEERING LOST POWER, AND THE VEHICLE STALLED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE CONTACT'S RESIDENCE. THE VEHICLE WAS LATER TOWED TO DICK SCOTT CHRYSLER DODGE JEEP RAM (734-451-2110, LOCATED AT 684 ANN ARBOR RD, PLYMOUTH, MI 48170) WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE ALTERNATOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE AND STATED THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 64,800.
THE TRANSMISSION MAY UNEXPECTEDLY SHIFT TO NEUTRAL, "CHRYSLER (FCA US LLC) IS RECALLING CERTAIN MODEL YEAR 2014-2015 JEEP CHEROKEE AND 2015 CHRYSLER 200, JEEP RENEGADE, RAM PROMASTER, AND 2016 FIAT 500X VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH 9-SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS."   THE RECALL CODE IS S55, BUT THIS CAR NOT INCLUDING THERE
POWER STEERING FAILED, POWER STEERING UNIT CRACKED AND LEAKING  WAS DRIVING 55MPH ON US 40 NEARING ELKTON.  POWER STEERING BECAME HEAVY, CAME TO A STOP AT A RED LIGHT. TURNING INTO A SHOPPING CENTER FOR A AUTOZONE. AT THIS POINT THE VEHICLE WAS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO DRIVE.  IF THERE WERE AND EMERGENCY MANEUVER TO BE MADE U DEFINITELY WOULD NOT HAVE MADE IT AND EASILY COULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT...  CHECKED POWER STEERING RESERVOIR WAS EMPTY,  LOOKING AT THE POWER STEERING UNIT THE BOTTOM WAS SOAKED AND BELOW THE POWER STEERING UNIT WAS SOAKED...  PURCHASED HYDRAULIC FLUID AND WAS ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE HOME.  LOOKING ONLINE I SAW THERE WERE OTHER COMPLAINTS SIMILAR IN DESCRIPTION..  FILED I BELIEVE WITH THE NTSB,  I MAY BE MISSING A LETTER...  IN EITHER CASE CHRYSLER/JEEP IS AWARE OF THIS AND I CANT BELIEVE THERE HAS NOT BEEN A RECALL ON THIS... THIS IS A DANGEROUS SAFETY HAZARD.   I CAN PROVIDE A MECHANIC'S DESCRIPTION OF DAMAGE...
1 WEEK AFTER THE DEALERSHIP ADDED THE WATER SHIELD TO THE BRAKES AS REQUIRED BY THE RECALL THE BRAKES STOPPED WORKING THE FIRST TIME YOU USED THEM AFTER STARTING THE VEHICLE. WE TOOK IT BACK AND WE'RE TOLD IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE RECALL AND THE EBT PUMP NEEDED REPLACING FOR $750. WE TOOK IT TO A DIFFERENT MECHANIC AND FOUND THAT THE BRAKE BOOSTERS WERE CORRODED AND THE EBT PUMP WAS FINE. CORRODED BRAKE BOOSTERS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE RECALL WAS INTENDED TO PREVENT AND WE SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO PAY FOR THE WORK. *TT  *TR
SUNROOF HAS FAILED 6 TIMES AND IS NOW READY FOR IT'S 7TH REPAIR. THE SUNROOF'S AUTOMATIC FUNCTIONS STOP WORKING SO WHEN IT FAILS YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE CLOSE BUTTON REPEATEDLY WHILE THE SUNROOF MOVES MAYBE 1/4" ON EACH DEPRESSION OF THE BUTTON. THE DEALER REPLACED THE MOTOR ONCE AND FOR THE OTHER 4 TIMES I WAS TOLD IT NEEDED TO BE CALIBRATED. THE LAST SUNROOF FAILURE THEY WENT IN AND WENT THROUGH ALL OF THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTORS AND SAID THEY FOUND SOME ELECTRICAL WIRING PROBLEMS AND FIXED THEM. THE SUNROOF FAILED AGAIN 2 WEEKS LATER. THE AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT, DUE TO ANOTHER ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR ISSUE.  THE ELECTRONICS IN THE VEHICLE MALFUNCTIONS REGULARLY WHICH AFFECT THE RADIO CONTROLS, NAVIGATION, CENTRAL LOCKING, PHONE, AND I GET RANDOM ERRONEOUS ERRORS ON THE DASH DISPLAY. THE RADIO/NAVIGATION UNITS HAVE BEEN REPLACED. THE NAVIGATION SCREEN LOCKS UP BUT THE VOICE WILL CONTINUE TO GIVE YOU VERBAL INSTRUCTIONS. IF YOU MANUALLY LOCK THE VEHICLE AND START WALKING AWAY THE HORN WILL BEEP TWICE AND THE VEHICLE WILL UNLOCK LIKE THE KEYS HAVE BEEN LOCKED IN THE CAR, EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE IN YOUR HAND. I WAS TOLD YOU CANNOT USE THE LOCK BUTTONS ON YOUR DOOR TO LOCK THE VEHICLE. WHEN YOU WALK UP TO THE CAR AND GRAB THE DOOR HANDLE TO UNLOCK THE CAR IT FAILS, AND YOU HAVE TO GRAB THE DOOR HANDLE ALL OVER REPEATEDLY TO GET IT TO UNLOCK. THE DASH DISPLAY WILL GIVE FALSE MESSAGES WHILE DRIVING LIKE ALREADY IN DESIRED GEAR AND NO ONE HAS TOUCHED THE SHIFTER. THE VOICE WILL COME ON RANDOMLY AND ASK YOU WHAT NUMBER YOU WANT TO CALL, AGAIN NO BUTTONS NOR THE DISPLAY HAVE BEEN TOUCHED. ERROR ON DISPLAY MEMORY SYSTEM, THE PROGRAMMED SEAT SWITCHES WERE REPLACED. TRANSMISSION ISSUE, THE MODULE WAS REPLACED. REAR HATCH FAILURE, FINALLY SWITCH WAS REPLACED. REAR TAIL LIGHT LENS REPLACED AS IT WAS FULL OF WATER. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, FAULTY OIL PRESSURE SWITCH. ENGINE VIBRATION, BAD AC COMP.
THE ALTERNATOR LIGHT CAME ON IN THE VEHICLE WHILE DRIVING, THEN WITHIN ABOUT 10-15 MINUTES THE RADIO HAD NO SOUND ALTHOUGH THE SCREEN WAS STILL LIT.  OTHER LIGHTS THEN CAME ON SUCH AS THE ENGINE LIGHT, ANTI-LOCK BRAKES.  ABOUT 5 MINUTES LATER, I HAD TO STOP AT A STOP SIGN, WHEN TAKING OFF AGAIN, THE CAR WOULD BARELY MOVE.  IT WOULDN'T GO ABOVE ABOUT 10-15 MILES PER HOUR, THEN IT PICKED UP SPEED BUT I NO LONGER HAD POWER STEERING.  AS I PULL INTO A PARKING LOT TO GET THE CAR OFF OF THE ROAD, THE WIPERS TURNED ON (EVEN THOUGH THE SWITCH WAS OFF).  WHEN I GOT INTO THE PARKING SPOT, THE CAR COULD NOT BE PUT INTO PARK DUE TO THE POWER ISSUES.  I HAD TO HOLD MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE UNTIL THE ENGINE DIED.  WITHIN 2-3 MINUTES THE ENGINE DIED.  EVERYTHING WAS DEAD, INCLUDING THE POWER LOCKS.  THEN A FEW MINUTES LATER THE DASH WOULD LIGHT SAYING THE IGNITION OR ACCESSORY UNIT WAS TURNED ON BUT YOU COULDN'T DO ANYTHING TO TURN IT OFF.  EVERYTHING WOULD THEN TURN OFF AGAIN.  AFTER SITTING FOR ABOUT 30-45 MIN, THE CAR WOULD START BACK UP BUT IT WAS NOT DRIVEN ANYWHERE, WE HAD IT TOWED.  BOTH THE ALTERNATOR AND BATTERY NEEDED TO BE REPLACED WHICH IS WHAT CAUSED THE ISSUES.  THE ALTERNATOR IS UNDER A RECALL FOR MY MODEL/YEAR/ENGINE TYPE BUT NOT FOR MY VIN.  THE RECALL WAS DUE TO VERY SIMILAR ISSUES, LOSS OF STEERING CONTROL, LOSS OF POWER.
THE DRIVER HEAD REST DEPLOUED WHILE DRIVEING ALMOST CAUSEING  THE DRIVE TO LOOSE CONTROLL
COPY OF A LETTER TO CHRYSLER CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICE SERGIO MARCHIONNE REGARDING SAFETY CONCERNS ABOUT A 2014 JEEP OVERLAND. *LD    THE CONSUMER STATED THE THERE WAS NO REPAIR AVAILABLE FOR THE SAFETY RECALL. THE CONSUMER STATED WHILE DRIVING A BATTERY ICON ILLUMINATED ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL. THE DEALER ADVISED THE ALTERNATOR FAILED AS PER THE RECALL.  *JS
RECALL ON JEEP ALTERNATOR AND BRAKE BOOSTER WATER SHIELD. MY COMPLAINT IS THE LENGTH OF TIME IN GETTING THE PARTS. THE ALTERNATOR WENT OUT AND IT HAS BEEN SITTING AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR 11 DAYS NOW AND PARTS ARE STILL NOT RELEASED FROM CHRYSLER. THEY WILL NOT GIVE ME A RENTAL. WHAT IS A PERSON TO DO? EXCEPT PAY 800$ AND THEN FIGHT CHRYSLER TO GET MY MONEY BACK.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 35 MPH, A LOUD NOISE OCCURRED. THE CONTACT NOTICED THAT THE PASSENGER HEADREST AIR BAG DEPLOYED WITHOUT WARNING. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO RYDELL CHRYSLER DEALER (700 SAN FERNANDO RD, SAN FERNANDO, CA 91340, PHONE (866) 733-3506) WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT AN ELECTRICAL CONCERN HEADREST RESTRAINT DID NOT LOCK INTO PLACE, AND THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT HEADREST RESTRAINT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED. IN ADDITION, WHILE DRIVING 65 MPH, THE ENGINE WARNING INDICATOR ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO RYDELL CHRYSLER WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE ENGINE FAILED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 22,000.
THE ACTIVE HEAD REST FOR MY 2014 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE HAD SPONTANEOUSLY DEPLOYED WHILE PARKED IN MY GARAGE. I HAD TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR AND I WAS TOLD THE PLASTIC CLIPS WERE BROKEN AND IT COULDN'T BE RESET AND THE HEAD REST NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AT MY EXPENSE. APPARENTLY THIS IS NOT A VEHICLE RECALL ISSUE BUT POSSIBLY SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO AS ONE. I HAVE FOLLOWED UP THIS TYPE OF ISSUE ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND MULTIPLE CASES WITH SIMILAR OR THE EXACT TYPE OF ISSUE. THIS POSES A HUGE SAFETY HAZARD, IF I HAD BEEN DRIVING, AND THE HEADREST DEPLOYED IN THIS MANNER IT COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.
I GOT IN MY CAR ONE EVENING AND NOTICED THE PASSENGER SIDE ACTIVE HEAD RESTRAINT WAS POPPED OPEN.  APPARENTLY THIS HAPPENED WHILE THE CAR WAS SITTING IN MY GARAGE.  I HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT AND THIS SEAT VERY RARELY HAS ANYONE SITTING IN IT.  WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP, THE SERVICE REP. SAID THE CHRYSLER REP. WAS THERE THAT DAY.  THE SERVICE REP. CAME BACK TO ME A LITTLE WHILE LATER AND SAID, "APPARENTLY THIS IS HAPPENING QUITE A BIT.  THE CHRYSLER REP. HAS YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION.  THEY WILL INVESTIGATE AND GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU."  OVER A WEEK LATER, THEY FINALLY SENT AN E-MAIL SAYING THEY WOULD NOT REPLACE THE PART BECAUSE THE VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY.  THIS IS A SAFETY FEATURE THAT HAS FAILED!!!  OTHERS HAVE POSTED ON THE INTERNET THAT THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO THEM, SOME WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD!  I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL TO REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE ACTIVE HEAD RESTRAINTS!!!  NOT ONLY IS A BROKEN ONE GOING TO FAIL TO PROTECT SOMEONE IN A WRECK, BUT ONE POPPING OPEN WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD CAN CAUSE A WRECK! THE PLASTIC PARTS INSIDE THE HEAD RESTRAINT ARE APPARENTLY NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR THE TENSION THAT IS PLACED ON THEM.  CHRYSLER SHOULD REPLACE THESE DEFECTIVE SAFETY DEVICES!
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. WITHOUT WARNING, THE CONTACT NOTICED SMOKE RISING FROM UNDER THE HOOD. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO A DEALER (PHILLIPS CHRYSLER JEEP DODGE RAM, 3440 S PINE AVE, OCALA, FL 34471, (352) 732-7577) WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE ALTERNATOR ASSEMBLY NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE ALTERNATOR WAS REPLACED AND THE DEALER INDICATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS EXCLUDED FROM NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 14V634000 (ELECTRICAL SYSTEM) DUE TO THE AMP BEING 180 AND NOT 160. IT WAS UNKNOWN IF THE VEHICLE WAS INCLUDED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 17V435000 (ELECTRICAL SYSTEM). THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE AND PROVIDED NO SOLUTION OTHER THAN HAVING THE DEALER REPLACE THE PART. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS NOT AVAILABLE. ...UPDATED 10/23/17 *BF  *JS
ON FEB 10TH 2017 WHILE DRIVING TO WORK THE CAR LOST ITS POWER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY, ABS FAILED, POWER STEERING FAILED, AND EVERY INDICATOR ON THE DASH BOARD LIT UP. WHEN THE CAR FINALLY STOPPED, CAR SHUT DOWN WHILE IT WAS IN GEAR.     AFTER FURTHER INSPECTION AT THE JEEP DEALERSHIP, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT ALTERNATOR WAS AT FAULT AND CAUSED THE CAR TO STALL AND ELECTRONICS TO FAIL. COSTING $1,600 IN REPAIRS
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. WHILE DRIVING 70 MPH, THE VEHICLE SHUT OFF, THE STEERING WHEEL SEIZED, AND THE POWER STEERING WARNING INDICATOR FAILED TO ILLUMINATE. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO A DEALER, BUT WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 32,000.
BAD ACCIDENT SIDE AND FRONT NO AIRBAGS DEPLOYMENT
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE DOORS LOCKED AUTOMATICALLY AND THE BLUETOOTH WOULD NOT CONNECT WITHOUT WARNING. THE VEHICLE WAS SERVICED PER NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 16V249000 (POWER TRAIN, SERVICE BRAKES, HYDRAULIC). AFTER THE REPAIR, THE BLUETOOTH STILL WOULD NOT CONNECT AND THE RADIO CUT OFF. THE DEALER PERFORMED A SOFTWARE UPDATE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 9,500.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS IN NEUTRAL AT A CAR WASH, THE CONTACT RELEASED THE BRAKE PEDAL AND OPENED THE DOOR. INDEPENDENTLY, THE GEAR SHIFTER SHIFTED FROM NEUTRAL TO PARK. THE VEHICLE WAS PREVIOUSLY REPAIRED PER NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 16V240000 (POWER TRAIN). THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 29,000.
SRS-HEAD REST SYSTEM.  CAR WAS IN PARK STATIONARY AND IN DRIVE WAY AT MY HOME AND FRONT PASSENGER GOT INTO THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT AND SRS ON HEAD REST WENT OFF FOR NO APPARENT REASON.  IT SHOULD ONLY GO OFF WHEN THERE IS A REAR END COLLISION.  THIS COULD NOT BE RESET AND THERE IS ONLY 39,000 MILES ON CAR.  HAD TO REPLACE AT MY OWN EXPENSE.  THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.
WHILE VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION ON THE HIGHWAY THE ENGINE SHUT OFF.  MY WIFE WAS DRIVING IT WITH OUR 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IN THE BACKSEAT.  AT THAT TIME THE VEHICLE LOST POWER STEERING. SHE CALLED ME IN A PANIC.  I CALLED THE JEEP DEALER WHO CAME AND TOWED THE VEHICLE IN TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT.  THE SAME THING HAPPENED  WHILE THE JEEP WAS IN THE SHOP AT CALIFORNIA SUPERSTORES IN VALENCIA, CA. THEY CALLED ME SEVERAL TIMES TO COME AND PICK THE CAR UP BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED, BUT THAT THERE WAS NOT A "FIX" FOR IT. DUE TO CONCERNS FOR MY FAMILYS SAFETY I REFUSED TO PICK THE CAR UP AND CALLED CHRYSLER WHO TOLD ME NOT TO PICK THE CAR UP, THAT IT WAS DANGEOUS TO DRIVE IT. THE NEXT WEEKI WAS AGAIN TOLD TO COME AND PICK THE CAR UP, THIS TIME BY BOTH THE DEALER AT CALIFORNIA SUPERSTORES, VALENCIA, CA AND BY THE CORPORATE PEOPLE AT CHRYSLER, AND TOLD THERE WAS NO FIX FOR THE PROBLEM. THE CAR JUST RANDOMLY SHUTS OFF WHILE DRIVING IT. I OPENED A CLAIM WITHCHRYSLER CORP. ABOUT THE CAR STALLING OUT BUT HAVE NOT HEARD BACK ABOUT ANY FIX OR RECALL.  THE CAR IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE AND I AM NOT RECEIVING ANY HELP FROM THE DEALER OR CHRYSLER CORP.  I PAID ALMOST $38,000 FOR THE CAR AND DO NOT EVEN WANT TO DRIVE IT OR HAVE MY FAMILY IN IT DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT COULD STALL AGAIN (IT HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES), THE STEERING GO OUT, AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT HARMING US OR OTHER DRIVERS ON THE ROADWAYS.
REGARDING RECALL 16V-240. I AM WRITING TO ENCOURAGE NHTSA TO REQUIRE FCA TO REPLACE THE ELECTRONIC SHIFT SELECTOR WITH ONE THAT STAYS IN THE POSITION CORRESPONDING TO THE TRANSMISSION GEAR SELECTION. MORE DISPLAY WARNINGS AND PRINTED CARDS WILL NOT SOLVE THE USER INTERFACE PROBLEM CREATED BY THE SHIFTER MOVING BACK TO CENTER REGARDLESS OF THE TRANSMISSION GEAR SELECTION. ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS, I HAVE MOVED THE SHIFT SELECTOR FORWARD FROM DRIVE TOWARD PARK, THINKING THAT I HAD HEARD/FELT 3 CLICKS AND THAT I WAS IN PARK, ONLY TO FIND THAT THE VEHICLE IS IN REVERSE.
WHEN I WAS TRYING TO MAKE A QUICK 3 POINT TURN,I HAD DIFFICULTY GETTING THE VEHICLE INTO REVERSE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF "FEELING" IN THE ELECTRONIC SHIFTER CONTROL. FIRST, IT WENT INTO PARK, THEN NEUTRAL. FINALLY I GOT IT INTO DRIVE BUT THE DELAY CAUSED A SAFETY HAZARD. A CAR COMING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION HAD TO MANEUVER AROUND ME.
WE ARE LEASING A 2014 JEEP CHEROKEE  COMPONEN:T GEAR SHIFT-  VEHICLE ROLLED BACK AFTER THINKING IT WAS IN PARK BUT DRIVER WAS ABLE TO JUMP BACK IN AND STOP IT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, BUT ON ONE OCCASION, VEHICLE ROLLED BACKWARD IN A PARKING GARAGE INTO A CEMENT PILLAR AFTER EXITING THE CAR THINKING IT WAS IN THE PARK POSITION CAUSING SEVERE DAMAGE TO THE REAR AND DRIVER SIDE.  NEW GEAR SHIFT DESIGN VERY TRICKY AND COULD BE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS
WHEN PLACING THE SHIFTER INTO PARK FROM THE DRIVE POSITION IT WILL AT TIMES HANG AT EITHER THE NEUTRAL OR REVERSE SETTING EVEN THOUGH THE SHIFT HANDLE WAS PUSHED FAR FORWARD TO ENGAGE PARK.  SOMETIMES TO SEPARATE ATTEMPTS ARE NEEDED TO CYCLE THE TRANSMISSION TO PARK.  I HAVE EXPERIENCED TIMES WHEN THE VEHICLE WILL ROLL BACKWARD SLOWLY WHILE IN N OR AGGRESSIVELY WHILE IN REVERSE.  EXTRAORDINARY CARE MUST BE EXERCISED TO INSURE SAFETY. THIS IS THE WORST SHIFTER I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH IN 45 YEARS OF CAR OWNERSHIP.
I HAVE HUGE PROBLEMS WITH THE KEY-LESS IGNITION AND THE ENGINE NOT TURNING OFF IN TWO CIRCUMSTANCES. FIRST, THE ENGINE IS VERY QUITE AND THE RADIO DOES NOT TURN OFF WHEN THE CAR IS TURNED OFF. IF YOU MISS THE SHUT OFF BUTTON THE CAR CONTINUES TO RUN EVEN WHEN YOU LEAVE WITH THE KEY. THERE IS NO WARNING WHEN YOU LEAVE THE STILL RUNNING CAR WITH THE KEY. YOU COME BACK HOURS LATER AND THE CAR IS STILL RUNNING.  SECOND, THE ELECTRONIC SHIFTER IS SO INACCURATE THAT IT IS VERY EASY TO TRY TO PUT IT IN PARK AND LEAVE IT JUST SHORT AND  IN REVERSE.  THE JEEP WON'T TURN OFF WHILE IT IS STILL IN GEAR, BUT IT IS SO QUIET THAT IT IS EASY TO MISS THAT IT IS STILL RUNNING  (PARTICULARLY IF YOU DID NOT IMMEDIATELY GET OUT OF THE CAR). WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF THE BRAKE THE CAR STARTS TO ROLL.  VERY DANGEROUS. JEEP'S RESPONSE IS TO PUT THE PARKING BRAKE ON, BUT WHO DOES THAT ANYMORE IF YOU ARE NOT ON A HILL.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. THE CONTACT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 15V393000 (STRUCTURE) HOWEVER, THE PART TO DO THE REPAIR WAS UNAVAILABLE.

THE HORN AND REAR WIPER BEGAN TO GO OFF AUTOMATICALLY ALONG WITH THE CONSOLE SCREENS FLASHING RESULTING IN THE VEHICLE TURNING OFF AT A STOP LIGHT. AFTER GETTING IT STARTED BACK UP, WHILE ON THE FREEWAY (70 MPH), THE HORN BEGAN HONKING ON ITS OWN AGAIN AND I WAS AFRAID THE VEHICLE WOULD TURN OFF ON THE FREEWAY RESULTING IN A POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS SITUATION SO I EXITED THE FREEWAY AND CAREFULLY PROCEEDED TO THE JEEP DEALERSHIP WHERE AFTER A FEW DAYS THEY DIAGNOSED IT WITH A FAULTY TOTAL INTEGRATED POWER MODULE (TIPM). IT WAS APPARENTLY NOT COVERED DUE TO THE FACT THAT I HAD APPROXIMATELY 38K MILES, INSTEAD OF 36K OF BELOW. HOW CAN AN ELECTRICAL SYSTEM FAIL DUE TO "NORMAL WEAR & TEAR"? I FEEL THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED UNDER WARRANTY INSTEAD OF BECOMING AN OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE FOR ME. I'M NERVOUS ABOUT DRIVING MY VEHICLE EVEN AFTER THE TIPM WAS REPLACED; IT DOESN'T FEEL THE SAME.
ON SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 2015, I ARRIVED AT A GAS STATION WITH ONE ADDITIONAL PASSENGER IN MY VEHICLE. WHEN WE FULLY STOPPED IN THE PARKING SPACE, THE JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE WAS PLACED IN PARK. THE SCREEN DISPLAY WAS STILL DISPLAYING THE CURRENT SATELLITE STATION. UPON EXITING THE VEHICLE, BOTH MY PASSENGER AND MYSELF, THE VEHICLE WAS LEFT RUNNING, BUT I TOOK THE KEY FOB WITH ME. I THEN PROCEEDED TO WALK AROUND AND BEHIND THE VEHICLE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CAR. THE GAS STATION WAS HAVING CONSTRUCTION WORK, AND IN FRONT OF THE VEHICLE WERE CONES AND THE AREA WAS BLOCKED OFF.     APPROXIMATELY 30 SECONDS LATER, WHILE BOTH MY PASSENGER AND MYSELF WERE INSIDE OF THE GAS STATION, A WITNESS CAME RUNNING TO THE GAS STATION WINDOW TO ALERT THE ATTENDANT, THAT A JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE HAS JUST TAKEN OFF ACROSS THE PARKING LOT.    AT THIS POINT, I DROPPED WHAT WAS IN MY HANDS, AND RAN TO LOOK.    THE JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE, 2014, HAD CRASHED ITSELF.    ONE WOULD NOT THINK THIS IS EVEN A POSSIBILITY.    PLEASE NOTE, THE KEYFOB WAS NOT IN THE VEHICLE, THE VEHICLE WAS PLACED IN PARK PRIOR TO EXITING, AND THE DOORS WERE LOCKED.     IF SOMEONE HAD TRIED TO STOP THE CAR, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO.    IT PROCEEDED TO TRAVEL, ON ITS OWN, BACKWARDS OVER 200 FEET AND CRASHED INTO A SPLIT RAIL FENCE, AND THEN LUCKILY IT CRASHED INTO THE ONLY TREE, BETWEEN THE SPACE IN WHICH IT WAS PROPERLY PARKED, AND AN INTERSECTION FOR A 55 MPH ROAD.     THE POLICE WERE THEN CALLED TO THE SCENE, IN ORDER TO DOCUMENT THE INCIDENT, AND TO PROVIDE A POLICE REPORT FOR THE DAMAGE.    NOW I AM LEFT WITH A JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE THAT COULD SERIOUSLY INURE A PERSON, ON ITS OWN, WITH ITS DOORS LOCKED, AND NO KEY FOB IN THE VEHICLE. IT IS ALSO DAMAGED, PARTS ARE BROKEN, AND IT ALSO HAS CAUSED PROPERTY DAMAGE.
WHILE DRIVING AT 80 MPH, A VERY LARGE BUCK RAN IN FRONT OF THE CAR ON THE INTERSTATE. AFTER DRIVING BACK BY TO SEE THE DEER THE NEXT DAY IT WAS PROBABLY AROUND 300 LBS. THE ENTIRE FRONT PORTION OF MY VEHICLE WAS CAVED IN. NO AIRBAGS DEPLOYED WHATSOEVER. HITTING SOMETHING SO MASSIVE AT SUCH A HIGH RATE OF SPEED SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED SOME SORT OF SAFETY MECHANISM I.E (AIRBAGS!!!!!)
THE 2014 GRAND CHEROKEE SUMMIT, WAS SERVICED ON 7/30/15. I HAD THE TIRES ROTATED AND AN OIL CHANGE. THE NEXT DAY, I GOT ON THE FREEWAY AND PROCEEDED TO DO 65MPH WHEN THE FRONT END AND OR THE STEERING WHEEL STARTED SHAKING VIOLENTLY. I AM GETTING THE TIRES BALANCED/SERVICED ON 8/19/15 TO SEE IF THAT WILL FIX THE PROBLEM.

SHOWED UP FOR APPOINTMENT AND AFTER TWO HOURS, I GOT AN OIL CHANGE, TIRE ROTATION SOME UPDATES AND NO SAFETY RECALL.  TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT I HAD TO TAKE A DAY OFF WORK FOR A RECALL I HAVE BEEN WAITING ON SINCE OCTOBER AND IT DID NOT HAPPEN. THESE RECALLS ARE JUST SCAMS TO GET THE OWNER TO HAVE OTHER WORK DONE.

I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THE P60 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE RECALL (ALTERNATOR DIODE) REPAIRED SINCE EARLY NOVEMBER 2014.  TWO DIFFERENT JEEP DEALERSHIPS HAVE BOTH SAID THERE ARE NO PARTS AVAILABLE TO MAKE THE REPAIRS AND NO ESTIMATE FOR WHEN PARTS MAY BECOME AVAILABLE.  THERE IS NO WAITING LIST.  THE DEALERSHIPS ADVISED TO JUST TRY CALLING BACK EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS.  THE FCA CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE HELPLINE PROVIDED THE SAME INFORMATION AND ADVICE.  THE RECALL NOTIFIES THE DRIVER THAT "THE DRIVER WILL HAVE LIMITED OR NO DETECTION OF THE ALTERNATOR FAILING, WHICH CAN RESULT IN VEHICLE SHUTDOWN WHILE DRIVING AND/OR AN UNDERHOOD ELECTRICAL FIRE."  THE FCA HELPLINE ADVISED TO NOT DRIVE THE VEHICLE IF POSSIBLE.  HOW CAN YOU NOT DRIVE YOUR VEHICLE FOR OVER SEVEN MONTHS?   THE DEALERSHIPS ADVISE IT COULD BE SEVERAL ADDITIONAL MONTHS UNTIL PARTS ARE AVAILABLE. HOW IS THIS AN ACCEPTABLE RESPONSE TO A CLEARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION?   *TR

THE JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE OVERLAND (MAY BE OTHER MODELS) HAS A FEATURE IDENTIFIED AS ECO.  IT IS ACTUALLY A DASH BUTTON THAT MUST BE MANUALLY OVERRIDDEN EACH TIME THE CAR IS STARTED.  THE FUNCTION IS (I SUPPOSE) A FUEL SAVING MODE, HOWEVER MYSELF AND MANY OTHERS IN THE JEEP BLOGS HAVE A SERIOUS ISSUE IN THAT THE CAR REACTS IN A SLUGGISH MODE WHEN PULLING INTO TRAFFIC AND SHIFTS IN A MANNER NOT NORMALLY ASSOCIATED WITH SMOOTH DRIVING AS THE SHIFT POINTS ARE CHANGED FROM WHAT ONE WOULD CONSIDER NORMAL.  IT APPEARS TO INJECT MORE AIR, LESS FUEL INTO THE FIRING PROCESS PRODUCING THE SLUGGISH DRIVING EXPERIENCE.  I AND OTHERS HAVE SOUGHT RELIEF FROM THIS ( OPT OUT FUNCTION) FROM DEALERS, TO NO AVAIL.  MANY DRIVERS, AS HAVE I,  HAVE EXPRESS FEAR OF A POTENTIAL COLLISION WHEN THIS FEATURE IS ENGAGED.  THERE APPEARS TO BE A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE EPA, SEEKING IMPROVED ECONOMY AND THE HIGHWAY SAFETY BOARD SEEKING TO REDUCE ACCIDENTS. AT THE VERY LEAST THIS FEATURE SHOULD BE MODIFIED TO BE AN "OPT IN" FEATURE TO BE POSSIBLY UTILIZED IN HIGHWAY CONDITIONS NOT IN STOP AND GO AND MERGING TRAFFIC.  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. THE CONTACT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 14V643000 (AIR BAGS, SEAT BELTS); HOWEVER, THE PART TO DO THE REPAIR WAS UNAVAILABLE. THE CONTACT WAS CONCERNED THAT THE AIR BAG WOULD DEPLOY IN HIS FACE. THE VEHICLE BURNED OIL CONTINUOUSLY AND THERE WAS BLUE FUMES COMING FROM THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE. IN ADDITION, THE HORN SOUNDED AND THE HOOD LATCH FAILED. THE DEALER REPAIRED THE VEHICLE. THE BRAKE MASTER CYLINDER PROTECTIVE PLATE WAS REPAIRED UNDER NHTSA CAMPAIGN NOTIFICATION P67. THE FUEL DOOR MECHANISM WAS FRACTURED AND THE DEALER REPAIRED THE VEHICLE. THE DIP STICK WAS NOT REPLACED. A GRINDER WAS MARKED FOR A NEW FACTORY DIP STICK. THE CONTACT ALSO STATED THAT THE DEALER PLACED TOO MUCH OIL IN THE VEHICLE. WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS NEW WITH LESS THAN 200 MILES, THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER FAILED AND THE CONTACT COULD NOT SEE HOW FAST THE VEHICLE WAS DRIVING. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER WHO DIAGNOSED A SHORT CIRCUIT IN THE SUN VISOR WIRING. THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED. THE CONTACT ALSO STATED THAT THE LOCKS UNLOCKED ON THEIR OWN.

NO TIME LINE ON GETTING PART OR VEHICLE BACK.  THIS LIMP MODE IS A MAJOR DANGER.  THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THERE WERE 46 "PARKED" JEEPS WAITING FOR THE PART.

AS YOU ACCELERATE THE DIESEL GRAND CHEROKEE AND IT REACHES 7TH GEAR, THE CAR STARTS SHUDDERING AS IF THE VEHICLE IS ABOUT TO "FALL APART". THIS ISSUE HAPPENS EVERY TIME WHEN IN 7TH AND 8TH GEAR.    I'VE HAD TO USE THE PADDLE SHIFTERS TO MAINTAIN THE VEHICLE IN 6TH GEAR TO AVOID SUCH SHAKING IN THE HIGHWAY.     I'VE TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO AN EMPTY ROAD AND ACCELERATED TO REPRODUCE THE ISSUE AND KEPT MY FOOT IN THE PETAL AND IT EVENTUALLY SETTLES DOWN AFTER 8TH GEAR. BUT IF YOU REMOVE FOOT FROM GAS AND LET THE CAR SHIFT BACK TO 6TH WHEN YOU RE-ACCELERATE THE SHUDDERING RETURNS AGAIN. THE ENTIRE CAR JUST SHAKES.    JEEP HAS BEEN UNABLE TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS AND THE VEHICLE IS NOT EVEN A YEAR OLD YET.  *TR
WHEN COMING TO A SLOW BRAKE, THE BRAKES STUTTER AND PUSH THE CAR FORWARD.     ADDITIONALLY, THE VEHICLE SOMETIMES WHEN DRIVING AT HIGHER SPEEDS (SPECIFICALLY ON THE FREEWAY AT ABOUT 60-70MPH) ENGINE REVS HIGH WITHOUT KICKING OVER. FURTHERMORE, WHEN SLOWING IT HAS A HARD TIME KICKING DOWN TO THE NEXT GEAR.     TRANSMISSION LIGHT HAS COME ON SEVERAL TIMES AS WELL.     WHEN TAKING THE VEHICLE IN FOR SERVICE, THEY ARE UNABLE TO RECOGNIZE ANY PROBLEMS AT ALL AND CAN NOT FIX.   *TR
I AM TRYING TO LET SOMEONE KNOW THAT I AM HAVING TROUBLE GETTING A SAFETY RECALL FIXED. I HAVE RECEIVED TWO DIFFERENT SAFETY RECALL NOTICES IN THE MAIL. ONE IN MAY AND ANOTHER IN SEPTEMBER. HAVE CONTACTED DEALERSHIP AND THEY ADVISED ON THE FIRST RECALL I WOULD BE PUT ON A WAITING LIST. ON THE SECOND RECALL I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO EVEN SPEAK WITH ANYONE AS I GET AN ANSWERING SERVICE AND THE DEALERSHIP HAS NOT RETURNED MY CALLS. DO NOT KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO AT THIS TIME.  *TR
NOTICED VEHICLE HAS CREAKING NOISE FROM THE REAR PORTION OF THE CAR. ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING AT LOW SPEED. SUSPECTED WAS THE REAR SUSPENSION BUSING. MADE AN APPOINTMENT AT THE DEALERSHIP TO CHECK UP.   *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. THE CONTACT RECEIVED A NOTIFICATION FOR RECALL NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 14V154000 (SERVICE BRAKES, HYDRAULIC).

MAY 30, 2014 I RECEIVED "IMPORTANT SAFETY RECALL" P14/NHTSA 14V-154 (BRAKE BOOSTER) AND IMMEDIATELY CALLED TWO LOCAL DEALERSHIPS, ARMORY GARAGE (ALBANY NY) AND LIA MOTORS (COLONIE NY) WHOM EACH PLACED ME ON A "WAITING" LIST BECAUSE NEITHER HAD THE REQUIRED PARTS FROM THE MANUFACTURER. I RECEIVED A FOLLOW-UP CALL FROM "LIA" FOR AN APT ON JUNE 30 BUT SERVICE HOURS NOT CONDUCIVE FOR MY WORKING SCHEDULE....SO I PHONED "ARMORY" BUT THE SERVICE DEPT STATES THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY PARTS FROM THE MANUFACTURER YET. HOW CAN ONE LOCAL DEALERSHIP RECEIVE PARTS FOR A NATIONAL RECALL AND ANOTHER DOESN'T ??? "ARMORY" HAS BETTER SERVICE HOURS SO I DON'T HAVE TO LOSE WORK PAY.   *JS
I WAS DRIVING THROUGH TOWN AND STARTED GETTING WARNING SAYING THAT THE DRIVERS SIDE AIRBAG NEEDED SERVICED AND DRIVES SIDE SEAT BELT NOT BEING DETECTED. I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED THE CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP AND SCHEDULED AN APPT., TOOK JEEP IN ON FIRST AVAILABLE DATE AND MECHANIC TOLD ME IT WAS A MODULE THAT HAD TO BE ORDERED AND THEIR WERE ONLY 24 OF THEM IN THE COUNTRY, I ASKED IF I HAVE AN ACCIDENT, WILL THE AIR BAD DEPLOY AND HE SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW, (THAT BEING MY MAIN CONCERN). HE ALSO TOLD ME THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE BRAKE BOOSTER AND HAS TO ORDER PART FOR THAT ALSO. IT HAS BEEN ALMOST A MONTH SINCE THEY ORDERED PARTS AND THEY ARE NOT IN YET. OBVIOUSLY THE DEALERSHIP ISN'T CONCERNED ENOUGH TO EXPEDITE THE ORDER OR GIVE ME ANOTHER VEHICLE TO DRIVE WHILE WAITING ON PARTS. I'M WONDERING, HAVE THERE BEEN ANY OTHER REPORTS FOR 2014 JEEPS WITH THESE ISSUES?  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE AIR BAG WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN AUTHORIZED DEALER WHO STATED THAT THE OC MODULE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED HOWEVER, THE PART WAS NOT AVAILABLE.

THE CONTACT WAS INCLUDED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER: 14V154000 (SERVICE BRAKES , SERVICE BRAKES, HYDRAULIC) AND WAS ALSO WAITING FOR PARTS FOR THE RECALL REPAIR. THE AUTHORIZED DEALER HAD NEITHER A SPECIFIC DATE NOR A TIMEFRAME TO LET THE CONTACT KNOW WHEN THE PARTS WOULD BECOME AVAILABLE FOR THE RECALL REPAIR. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE.

ON 3/27/14, MY BRAND NEW 2014 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE SPONTANEOUSLY BURST INTO FLAMES AND ALMOST GOT IN MY FACE.  AFTER SMELLING AND SEEING SMOKE, I PULLED OVER INTO A DIRT PARKING LOT AT A BUSINESS AND THE DASHBOARD OF MY NEW VEHICLE BURST INTO FLAMES, AFTER I HEARD A "WOOSH."  A LADY FROM THE LOCAL BUSINESS CAME RUNNING OUT OF THE BUSINESS WITH A FIRE EXTINGUISHER AND I WAS ABLE TO SHOOT IT INTO THE HOLES THAT WERE ONCE THE HEAT VENTS TO KILL THE FLAMES.  THE DASH WAS BUCKLED, THE WINDSHIELD BLACKENED, THE GAUGES MELTED, THE ROOF LINING GONE, THE VISORS MELTED, AND THE INSIDE COVERED WITH CO2 AND SMOKE DAMAGE. I SUFFERED SMOKE AND CO2 INHALATION AND MY CLOTHES WERE RUINED, BUT I AM LUCKY TO BE ALIVE!  THE DEALER REFUSES TO HELP ME....UPDATED 09-10-2014 *BF    UPDATED 11/7/2014   *JS
THE WAY THE STEERING WHEEL ON THE NEW JEEP IS DESIGNED, WHEN YOU GO TO MAKE A TURN, ITEMS ON YOUR SLEEVES (ZIPPERS, BUTTONS, OR BRACELETS) CAN GET WEDGED IN BETWEEN THE PAD THAT COVERS THE HORN AREA OF THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE WHEEL IT SELF.  ONCE THIS HAPPENS, THE OBJECT GETS LODGED INTO PLACE AND YOU CANNOT REMOVE IT, AND YOU ALSO CANNOT PROPERLY STEER THE VEHICLE.  THE ONLY RECOURSE IS TO COME TO A COMPLETE STOP AND WORK THE ITEM LOOSE.  LUCKILY THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED WHILE WE WERE TRAVELING AT HIGH SPEEDS OR IT WOULD HAVE SURELY CAUSED AN ACCIDENT.    THEY SAY A PICTURE IS WORTH A 1000 WORDS.  I HAVE PHOTOS TO SUBMIT IF IT WOULD DEMONSTRATE THE ISSUE MORE CLEARLY.  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. THE CONTACT REFERENCED NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER 13V483000 (ELECTRICAL SYSTEM , ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL , SERVICE BRAKES, HYDRAULIC) AND STATED THAT THE DEALER WAS UNABLE TO SERVICE THE 2014 MODEL YEAR VEHICLES UNTIL JANUARY 2014 BECAUSE ONLY ONE RECALL REMEDY REPAIR WAS BEING PERFORMED PER DAY. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE PROBLEM. THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE.
WHEN I DROVE THE CAR AT AROUND 60 MPH THE STEERING WHEEL SHAKES SIDE TO SIDE AGGRESSIVELY. THE DEALERSHIP CHANGED TWO DRIVE SHAFTS AND CHECKED THE BALANCE OF THE TIRES. AFTER ALL THAT IT STILL SHAKES THE DEALERSHIP SAID IT JUST HOW THE JEEP RIDES NO CAR OR TRUCK I'VE DROVE EVER DID THAT. I THINK ITS A SAFETY DEFECT IN THE STEERING AT HIGH SPEEDS AND ALL I DRIVE IS EXPRESSWAY DRIVING. A NEW VEHICLE SHOULDN'T  DRIVE LIKE THIS.  *TR
WHILE TRAVELING AT HIGH SPEED OR LOW SPEED FOR NO REASON VEHICLES GEAR SHIFTER SELECTS NEUTRAL  ON ITS OWN. ALSO PROBLEMS WITH VEHICLE INSTRUMENTS DISPLAY, DISPLAYING VARIOUS FAULTS WITH VEHICLE. AFTER VEHICLE COMES TO A STOP AND VEHICLE RESTARTED PROBLEM DISAPPEARS THEN REAPPEARS A SHORT TIME LATER. NOW TAKEN BACK TO DEALER FOR THEM TO REPAIR VEHICLE. STILL WAITING AFTER TWO WEEKS FOR CHRYSLER TO REPAIR/SUPPLY NEW PARTS.  *TR
The headrests on both my drivers and passenger side popped out.  This seems to be a reoccuring issue with Jeeps and it happened while I was driving.  The airbags have not been deployed and I was not in an accident.  They will not go back in and Jeep wants $750 to replace each as they are not covered under a recall.
While driving downtown Atlanta, Ga I heard a loud noise and then a hit in the back of my head. I was startled at first not knowing what had happened. I first thought maybe I way hit by another vehicle, or someone may have thrown something from the overpass. I got off the interstate and found the head rest had blown open. I have since learned that possibly the car maker is aware of the problem, I don't know if the car maker is fixing the problem. I see where this could have negative results to owners that already have neck and back problems, another big concern is having an accident. This occurred [XXX]  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
The headrest broke for no reason
The contact owns a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The contact stated while driving 5 MPH, the vehicle went into LIMP Mode. The check engine warning light and other unknown warning lights were illuminated. The contact received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 22V406000 (Fuel System, Diesel); however, the part to do the recall repair was not yet available. The local dealer was contacted. The vehicle was towed to the local dealer but was not diagnosed or repaired. The contact stated that the manufacturer had exceeded a reasonable amount of time for the recall repair. The manufacturer was made aware of the issue. The failure mileage was approximately 97,000. Parts distribution disconnect.
I got into my car and headed home from work. All of a sudden, my headrest popped apart and smacked me in the back of the head. I was not involved in any sort of accident. I was just driving. I pulled over and looked around because I didn’t understand what smacked me in the back of the head. I got out of my vehicle and looked at my seat. My head wrist had popped completely apart, and the clips that held it together were broken, disabling me from putting it back together so that I could drive safely and comfortably.
The Passenger headrest just snapped forward and the clips broke.
The contact owns a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The contact stated while his wife was driving at approximately 80–85 MPH, the vehicle stalled. The driver was able to veer safely off the road. There were no warning lights illuminated. The vehicle was towed to the local dealer, where it was repaired under NHTSA Campaign Number: 23V411000 (Engine and Engine Cooling). The vehicle was repaired. After retrieving the vehicle from the dealer, the contact's wife noticed that the check engine warning light was illuminated. The dealer informed the contact about the codes and determined that the throttle body and the tone wheel needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was contacted, but no additional assistance was provided. The contact stated that the failure was related to NHTSA Campaign Number 23V411000 (Engine and Engine Cooling) and 22V406000 (Fuel System, Diesel). The failure mileage was approximately 143,000.
While returning home from vacation, the high pressure fuel pump on my vehicle failed.  This happened while in heavy traffic traveling 70mph on I-95.  This incident left myself, my husband, and my four month old infant at the time stranded on the I-95 shoulder in 90 degree heat for three hours.  My husband was barely able to maneuver the vehicle to the shoulder after all power was lost and the car was billowing smoke.  The problem was confirmed by the dealer.  The dealer inspected and replaced the high pressure fuel pump and other fuel system components four months later but failed to inspect other engine components for damage related to the high pressure fuel pump failing.  Because of the lack of thorough inspection, when the service person at the dealer started the engine again, the engine completely failed.  The dealer and Jeep are refusing to honor the recall and repair my engine due to a recalled item failing.  Prior to the high pressure fuel pump imploding and ripping shrapnel through the entire fuel system and engine, a yellow check engine light came on.  While trying to find a safe place to pull over while traveling 70mph in heavy traffic on I-95, diesel began pouring out of the bottom of the vehicle, smoke started billowing out of the engine, a handful of warning lights flashed across the screen, and all power was lost to the car.  This happened in less than approximately 5mins/10miles from the yellow check engine light initially appearing.   Prior to this incident, there were no sounds or warning signs that there was something internally wrong with the engine.
Passenger headrest spontaneously deployed at a VERY violent force. Will not go back in.
Car does not accelerate on a hill readily. Difficult to get it to move as necessary at times.
When shifting of and on the vechicle when driving may go down in a gear then you have to push up in column to get back in drive.  It’s been happening off and on for awhile but is concerning.

While in motion, vehicle lost all power; the engine stalled, brakes failed and lost power steering. The vehicle shifted into neutral. I put the vehicle back in drive and it went back to neutral. I turned the ignition off and restarted. My husband was driving and I was in the passenger seat, with my 5 year old daughter in the backseat. If there had been oncoming traffic, we’d have hit them head on.

The contact notified the manufacturer of the failure and inquired about reimbursement; however, the manufacturer denied her claim after several attempts. The failure mileage was approximately 177,060.
Car keeps saying service shifter. Safety at risk car cuts off and on when I’m driving now the car won’t start completely. A lot off Jeep Grand Cherokee are having this problem. Components not inspected. Service shifter light just came on yesterday. Car won’t start today
Hello I’ve seen some oil leakage all over engine of car. Mechanic stated the oil filter housing has to be replaced but not covered under jeep warranty. car is driving ok for now .I’m at 79,000 miles. I’m concerned that this may become a bigger issue especially fire hazard when driving car.I’ve see similar issue on 2 other jeeps grand cherokees. I have not seen it come up as a recall but have seen multiple complaints.I feel that this is a mechanical issue and should be covered by Jeep.
While in Starbucks drive through, my vehicle suddenly accelerated and hit the vehicle in front of me.
I had just pulled out of a parking lot and started down the road going no more then 25 mph when I felt something bang hard against me about center of the back my seat I also heard a bang sound so I pulled off the road and into a parking lot and discovered that my head rest had come apart. I have looked online to see if other owners of Grand Cheroke Jeeps have had this happen and found that this has has happened to others.
The passenger headrest has came apart for no reason. The jeep has not been involved in any type of accident. Since there is not a recall the dealerships will not replace this even though there are many complaints about it.
Headrest deployed without warning. Have read online that this is a very common problem with an expensive fix. Luckily no one was sitting in seat when it deployed or could have caused injuries. If it happens to drivers seat while driving this could be a very dangerous situation.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS 2015 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE AUTO-PARK FEATURE FAILED TO ENGAGE. ADDITIONALLY, WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED, THE VEHICLE ROLLED FORWARD, WITHOUT WARNING. THE CONTACT CALLED BEDFORD CHRYSLER DODGE JEEP INC - BEDFORD PA (7055 LINCOLN HWY, BEDFORD, PA 15522, (877) 915-5008) HOWEVER, THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED NOR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS CONTACTED AND INFORMED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 117,414.
I HAVE BEEN HAVING TROUBLE PUTTING FUEL IN MY CAR SINCE I BOUGHT IT. I WAS TOLD THAT THIS WAS JUST A PROBLEM WITH JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE XJ.  BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO FUEL UP, TWICE I HAVE SPRAYED FUEL ALL OVER MYSELF AND ONCE I HAD THE RENTS MYSELF WITH WATER. MY WARNING LIGHT IS A NOW ON . NOW THE CAPLESS FUEL CAP ASSEMBLY CAME OFF WHILE I WAS FEELING. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN FEEL UP ANYMORE MAKING THE CAR USELESS UNTIL REPAIRED
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING AT VARIOUS SPEEDS, THE TRANSMISSION WOULD ERRONEOUSLY SWITCH TO THE SPORTS MODE AND A WINING NOISE WOULD OCCUR WHILE ACCELERATING. ALSO, WHILE ACCELERATING THE VEHICLE WOULD JERK AND VIBRATE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE LOCAL DEALER FRONTIER CHRYSLER LOCATED AT 5801 TX-327 SPUR, LUBBOCK, TX 79424 WHO WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS LATER TAKEN TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHO DIAGNOSED THAT THE TRANSMISSION NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 20,000.
I HAVE A DIESEL ENGINE WHICH HAS A VERY OBVIOUS LAG IN GETTING POWER TO THE TRANSMISSION. THIS IS GETTING WORSE AND AFFECTS MY ABILITY TO ENTER IN TO TRAFFIC SAFELY.EVEN IF I HAVE ALLOWED FOR SAFE DISTANCE TO MERGE INTO A LANE I NEVER KNOW IF MY CAR WILL SPEED UP QUICKLY ENOUGH SO AS TO NOT GET HIT
YES I AM DRIVING AN THE SERVICE SHIFTER COMES ON. IT HAS COME ON MULTIPLE  TIME AND EVEN CHANGED THE GEAR I WAS IN WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON ITS OWN.
FRONT PASSENGER SEAT HEADREST DEPLOYED WHILE SITTING IN THE SEAT. I WAS NOT HIT AT ANYTIME.
UPON ENTERING THE CITY STREET A LOUD BANG WAS HEARD FROM THE HOOD OF THE VEHICLE AND CAR STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. POWER WAS IN THE VEHICLE BUT ABILITY TO SHIFT IN GEAR WAS GONE. AFTER TURNING OFF AND BACK ON I WAS ABLE TO PUT THE JEEP IN DRIVE IN ORDER TO CLEAR THE ROAD AS TO AVOID A TRAFFIC BUILD UP. IT SEEMS THE TRANSMISSION IS GONE BECAUSE THE VEHICLE WILL NOT CHANGE INTO GEAR NOR REVERSE. A WRECKER COMPANY WAS CONTACTED TO BRING JEEP TO DEALER.
WHILE MY 2015 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE WAS PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY OVERNIGHT, THE DRIVER'S SEAT HEADREST DEPLOYED. THERE WAS NO INCIDENT DURING THE NIGHT THAT WOULD'VE CAUSED THE HEADREST TO DEPLOY, IT SIMPLY DEPLOYED FOR NO REASON. THIS SEEMS LIKE A SAFETY CONCERN TO ME, SINCE IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED WHILE SOMEONE WAS IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT.
THE HEAD REST POPPED OUT WITHOUT ANY COLLISION. IT JUST HAPPENED UNEXPECTEDLY. AND IS NOT BROKE.  *TR
HEADREST SAFETY (AHR) DEPLOYED WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON A CITY STREET AND HIT MY PASSENGER'S HEAD WITH VIOLENCE. I ALMOST CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT BECAUSE THE NOISE OF THE HEADREST DEPLOYMENT WAS LOUD AND I THOUGHT THAT SOMEONE HIT MY CAR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. AS A CONSEQUENCE I MOVED TO THE OPPOSITE LANE AND ALMOST HIT AN UPCOMING VEHICLE. AFTER A GOOGLE SEARCH I DISCOVERED THAT THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL AND MANY OTHER JEEP OWNERS HAD THE SAME ISSUE. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SAFETY ISSUE AND FCA SHOULD RECALL ALL VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH THIS DEFECTIVE SYSTEM.
I WENT IN TO HAVE A ROUTINE OIL CHANGE AND FOUND OUT THAT I NEEDED TO REPLACE MY RACK AND PINION. MY JEEP IS A 2015 GRAND CHEROKEE WITH LESS THAN 45,000 MILES. THE PRIMARY USE OF THE VEHICLE IS JUST GETTING BACK AND FORTH TO WORK AND IT HAS NEVER BEEN DRIVEN OFF OF A PAVED ROAD. THIS IS NOT A FAILURE THAT SHOULD BE INCURRED THIS EARLY ON IN THE JEEPS LIFE WITH AN OWNER THAT IS ONLY DRIVING IT CASUALLY.
ONE MORNING AS I GOT INTO MY JEEP TO DRIVE TO WORK, I NOTICED THE PASSENGER SIDE HEADREST HAD POPPED OPEN, SEEMINGLY OVERNIGHT. I DID NOT WITNESS THIS HAPPENING - I JUST NOTICED THE END RESULT. I HAVE TRIED TO "CLOSE" IT BUT I AM UNABLE TO DO SO.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE ENGINE FAILED TO START. THE ONLY INDICATOR ILLUMINATED ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL WAS THE "SERVICE ELECTRIC BRAKE SYSTEM". THE CONTACT ALSO STATED THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE HEADLIGHT BLINKER FAILED TO OPERATE. THE CONTACT TOOK THE VEHICLE TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHO REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP, BODY CONTROL MODULE, AND COMPUTER. THE REPAIR DID NOT CORRECT THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO CHRYSLER DODGE JEEP RAM FIAT OF BAY RIDGE (8825 5TH AVE, BROOKLYN, NY 11209-5901) WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE FUEL PUMP CONNECTOR FAILED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS CONTACTED. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT INCLUDED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 19V813000 (ELECTRICAL SYSTEM). THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 114,000.
WE HAD OUR 2015 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE WORKED ON TO REPAIR THE ISSUES PER NHTSA RECALL # 16V-240. RECENTLY, THE JEEP ALERTED ME AS I WAS DRIVING AT A SPEED OF APPROX. 35 MPH THAT THE "AUTOPARK HAS BEEN DISABLED." MY DEALER IS UNABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHY THIS RECALL/SOFTWARE UPDATE HAS FAILED AND RENDERED THE "ADDITIONAL MECHANISM TO MITIGATE THE EFFECT OF OPERATOR ERROR IN FAILING TO SHIFT THE MONOSTABLE GEAR SELECTOR INTO PARK PRIOR TO EXITING THE VEHICLE" CURRENTLY USELESS.
PASSENGER SEAT HEAD REST DEPLOYED FOR NO REASON. THE VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY OVER NIGHT IN OUR GARAGE. IN THE MORNING WE DISCOVERED THE DEPLOYED HEAD REST
MY 2015 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE HAS AN EXPANSION VALVE LEAK, WHICH IS LEAKING INTO THE VEHICLE (SINCE FCA DECIDED TO INSTALL THE EXPANSION VALVE IN THE CAR BEHIND THE DASHBOARD). THE LEAK IS A SERIOUS HEALTH RISK AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISK. THE SYSTEM ALSO MAKES A CONSTANT HUMMING NOISE SINCE ITS LOW ON FREON. I HAD IT FULLY RECHARGED AND IN A MATTER OF MONTHS ALL OF THE FREON LEAKED INTO MY CAR! THIS IS POISONOUS GAS LEAKING INTO PEOPLES VEHICLES!! I CALLED MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND THEY QUOTED ME UPWARDS OF $1,700 TO FIX THE ISSUE, WHICH BASED ON OTHER ONLINE POSTINGS BY JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE OWNERS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON ISSUE WITH THE CAR.    I HAVE ALSO RECENTLY UPDATED THE CAR'S UCONNECT SOFTWARE TO THE MOST RECENT VERSION RELEASED, AND NOW MY 911 PHONE OPTION AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM NO LONGER WORKS. MY UNDERSTAND IS THAT UCONNECT SOFTWARE WAS UPDATED TO USE 4G TECHNOLOGY, BUT MY 2015 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE HAS 2015 3G TECHNOLOGY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY FCA WOULD PUNISH THEIR LOYAL CUSTOMERS BY PUSHING THIS TYPE OF UPGRADE, IN THE PROCESS COMPLETELY MAKING THEIR CUSTOMERS NAVIGATION SYSTEMS USELESS. APPARENTLY THE PARTS ALONE ARE IN THE $1,000 + RANGE TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE NAVIGATION UNIT. THE 911 PHONE OPTION SHOULD AT A MINIMUM BE A SAFETY REQUIREMENT, AND FCA PUSHING THEIR SOFTWARE UPGRADE COMPLETELY DISABLED THIS. I CALLED UCONNECT BUT THEY ARE OF NO HELP. I HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME JEEP OWNER, PURCHASING DIFFERENT MODELS OVER THE YEAR, BUT I DON'T THINK I WILL BE ABLE TO BUY ANOTHER JEEP IF FCA CAN'T STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT.
WHILE SIMPLY DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD MY PASSENGER SIDE HEADREST JUST POPS OPEN.  IT SEEMS THE CLIPS HAVE BROKEN.  THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL AS I HAVE SPOKEN TO MANY OWNERS WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND SHOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF FROM THE DEALERSHIP AND NOT COST $800.00 FOR SOMETHING THAT IS FAULTY.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. WHILE THE CONTACT'S MOTHER-IN-LAW WAS DRIVING 55 MPH, THE HEADREST SPRANG FORWARD AND STRUCK THE BACK OF THE DRIVER'S HEAD. THERE WERE NO INJURIES. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE DEALER AND MANUFACTURER WERE NOT NOTIFIED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 64,218.
AIR CONDITIONING MESSED UP SO WE TOOK IT IN. WAS TOLD IT IS THE EVAPORATOR COIL NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. THE PART IS ON NATIONAL BACK ORDER WHICH SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THIS IS AN ISSUE A LOT OF JEEP OWNERS ARE DEALING WITH. THE AIR CONDITIONING BLOWS HOT AIR AND MAKES A SOUND LIKE IT IS CUTTING OFF AND THEN BACK ON. IT HAPPENS WHETHER WE ARE PARKED OR IN MOTION. WE HAVE LESS THAN 30,000 MILES ON OUR CAR TOO SO THIS SEEMS LIKE IT'S JUST A PROBLEM THAT IS HAPPENING WITH THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE.
ON DECEMBER 13, 2018 WE ATTEMPTED TO MOVE OUR JEEP FROM ONE PARKING SPACE TO ANOTHER.  TURNING INTO THE NEW SPACE, THE POWER STEERING WENT COMPLETELY OUT MAKING IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO STEER AT ALL.    THE JEEP WAS TAKEN INTO THE DEALERSHIP, WHO TOLD US THE POWER STEERING PUMP WOULD NEED REPLACED.  THE PART WAS ON BACK ORDER AND IT WOULD TAKE UNTIL AFTER CHRISTMAS TO GET IN.  WE WERE FORCED TO DRIVE THE JEEP WITH THE POWER STEERING NOT WORKING.  IN WINTER, IN NE OHIO.    WHEN CHRISTMAS TIME CAME AND WENT, THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED US THAT THE PART WAS STILL NOT AVAILABLE AND WE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL JANUARY 30, 2019 - 7 WEEKS SINCE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED.    HERE WE ARE, JANUARY 31, 2019 AND NOW THE DEALERSHIP TELLS US THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO AND IT WILL BE AT LEAST MARCH, 2019 UNTIL THEY CAN GET ANY REPLACEMENT.  WE PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE IN FEBRUARY, 2018.  AND THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED 10 MONTHS LATER.    JEEP SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR HAVING REPLACEMENT PARTS AVAILABLE ON THEIR VEHICLES, ESPECIALLY SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS POWER STEERING IN THE DEAD OF WINTER IN OHIO.  VERY UNSAFE, AND VERY DISSATISFIED!
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 75 MPH, THE DRIVER'S SEAT HEADREST EXPLODED. THE CONTACT STATED THAT A FRAGMENT OF THE HEADREST STRUCK THE DRIVER IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE HEADREST WAS DESIGNED AS A PREVENTATIVE SAFETY MEASURE AGAINST THE WHIPLASH EFFECT DURING A REAR END COLLISION. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE HEADREST ACTUATOR FRACTURED INTO PIECES, WHICH CAUSED THE HEADREST TO STRIKE THE CONTACT IN THE HEAD. THE CONTACT EXPERIENCED PAIN IN THE BASE OF THE HEAD, BUT DID NOT RECEIVE MEDICAL ATTENTION. GENGRAS CHRYSLER DODGE JEEP RAM (460 CONNECTICUT BLVD, EAST HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT 06108, (860) 289-0246) WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE AND STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY FOR REPAIRS. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 79,000.
I HAVE A 2015 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE LIMITED WITH ABOUT 48K MILES AND NOTICED A HISSING SOUND COMING WHEN I HAVE THE AC ON, A FEW WEEKS LATER I NOTICED THAT IT WOULD COOL SOMETIMES AND SOMETIMES IT WOULD ONLY THROW HOT AIR. I TOOK IT TO GET DIAGNOSED AND SEEMS IT WAS A AC PRESSURE VALVE.  HAVE READ THAT THEY HAVE RECALLED ON OTHER JEEP CHEROKEE'S WONDERING IF THIS A FAULTY ISSUE WITH THE GRAND CHEROKEE AS WELL. SADLY , SINCE I WILL BE OUT $200 FOR A DEDUCTIBLE AND UNFORTUNATELY CANNOT WAIT FOR A RECALL AS I LIVE IN TEXAS AND I NEED MY AC.
I WAS STOPPED AT A STOPLIGHT.  WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN AND I ACCELERATED, MY VEHICLE WENT IN REVERSE.  I QUICKLY SWITCHED THE GEAR BACK TO "DRIVE," BUT OVERCOMPENSATED AND REAR ENDED THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME.  THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE.  THE GEAR ON MY JEEP IS OVERLY SENSITIVE AND FLIPS FROM "DRIVE" TO "REVERSE" TO "NEUTRAL" WITHOUT MY NOTICE (I.E., IF MY ELBOW HITS IT).  THIS IS A BIG SAFETY ISSUE, AS IT HAS RESULTED IN ACCIDENTS. *TT    *CN
THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION DOWNSHIFTS HARSHLY WITH A BANG.  UP SHIFTS ARE ALSO HARSH AT TIMES.  TRANSMISSION SOFTWARE HAS BEEN UPDATED TWICE BUT THE ISSUE CONTINUED. RECENTLY THE TRANSMISSION VALVE BODY WAS REPLACE AND THE ISSUE HAS GOTTEN MUCH WORSE.  MY JEEP IS CURRENTLY BACK AT THE DEALERSHIP.
THE FRONT SIDE WINDOWS OF THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SEATS DO NOT WIPE OFF THE RAIN WHEN YOU PUT WINDOWS DOWN AND THEN BACK UP. THERE IS A BIG ENOUGH GAP WHERE LARGE RAINDROPS ARE UNMOVED WHEN THE WINDOW GOES DOWN. VISIBILITY IS POOR OUT OF WINDOWS AND SIDE MIRRORS DURING A STORM. JEEP SAID THE WINDOWS ARE DESIGNED TO KEEP DIRT FROM GETTING INSIDE OF THE DOOR EFFECTING THE ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT BUT I HAVE NEVER HAD A CAR THAT COULDN'T DO BOTH. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED.
THE REAR PASSENGER SEAT BELT LATCH IS NOT FLEXIBLE AT AN ANGLE BELOW THE SEAT. AS A RESULT, THE CONTACT WAS UNABLE TO LATCH THE SEAT BELT. EVEN IF THE SEAT BELT IS FORCED TO LATCH, THE BELT STUCK IN THE CORNER OF THE BUCKLE UNLESS YOU ADJUST TO THE RIGHT ANGLE TO TIGHTEN THE BELT. THIS IS TOTALLY NOT SAFE TO ANY PASSENGER (ESPECIALLY ANY CHILD). OVER TIME THE SEAT BELT ALSO GETS WRINKLE FROM STUCK IN THE CORNER OF THE BUCKLE AND IT DOES NOT ROLL BACK BY ITSELF.   I SAW SOMEONE ASKED THE JEEP DEALER ABOUT THE PROBLEM ONLINE BUT THE DEALER TOLD THE CONSUMER TO PURCHASE A SEATBELT EXTENSION. I DO NOT THINK IT IS FAIR OR A SAFE FUTURE TO ANY JEEP CONSUMER. I'M HOPING JEEP CAN RESOLVE THE BELT BUCKLE OR WRINKLE BELT ISSUES.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. WHILE DRIVING 35 MPH, THE VEHICLE INDEPENDENTLY SHIFTED GEARS WITHOUT WARNING. IN ADDITION, THE VEHICLE SHUTTERED. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED AFTER THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO BE SERVICED PER NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 16V240000 (POWER TRAIN). THE FAILURE RECURRED SEVERAL TIMES. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 3,500. UPDATED 01/05/2017*CT  UPDATED 01/17/17.*JB
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED, IT BEGAN TO ROLL AWAY. THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE WHEELS ROLLED OVER THE CONTACT'S LEGS. MEDICAL ATTENTION WAS REQUIRED. THERE WERE NO WARNING INDICATORS ILLUMINATED. THE FAILURE RECURRED NUMEROUS TIMES. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE VIN WAS INCLUDED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 16V240000 (POWER TRAIN). THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 15,000.
WHILE DRIVING, THE GEAR SHIFT CONTROL MECHANISM WILL SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL WHEN INADVERTENTLY BUMPED.  THIS HAS OCCURRED ON A FEW OCCASIONS WHILE I WAS REACHING ACROSS TO THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT, PASSENGER SEAT, RADIO, OR PHONE CHARGER CONSOLE AREA.  ALL OF THESE AREAS ARE NEAR, OR IN LINE WITH, THE GEAR SHIFT CONTROL WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CAR BELOW THE ARM REST ON THE DRIVER'S RIGHT HAND SIDE.  TWICE THIS HAS OCCURRED ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN I WAS REACHING FOR CHANGE FOR A TOLL.  PER THE DESIGN (ACCORDING TO MY DEALER'S CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE), THE GEAR SHIFT BUTTON DOESN'T REQUIRE IT TO BE PUSHED IN WHEN SHIFTING FROM DRIVE TO NEUTRAL.  SO, WHEN/IF I LIGHTLY BUMP IT (AS I HAVE WITHOUT REALIZING IT), IT WILL SIMPLY & QUIETLY SHIFT FROM DRIVE INTO NEUTRAL.  IT IS A DESIGN FLAW THAT IS VERY DANGEROUS.  THE BUTTON ON THE GEAR SHIFT LEVER SHOULD REQUIRE THE DRIVER TO PRESS IT FOR ANY SHIFT CHANGES.  THE CUSTOMER SERVICE AGENT AT THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME ALL THE JEEP GEAR SHIFTS WERE DESIGNED THIS WAY.  I ASKED HIM IF I SHOULD FILE A COMPLAINT WITH JEEP CHRYSLER AND HE TOLD ME IF I WANTED TO I COULD BUT ... THEN HE JUST SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS.  SO, RATHER THAN TAKING THE CHANCE OF BEING IGNORED I FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE NHTSA BEFORE SOMEONE GETS INJURED OR KILLED.

ON FRIDAY MAY 20, 2016 I STOPPED AT THE SHELL GAS STATION TO GET A CUP OF COFFEE.  I PLACED THE VEHICLE IN PARK (ENGINE RUNNING) AND EXITED THE VEHICLE. AS I WALKED TO THE STORE, OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE I SAW MY GRAND CHEROKEE BACKING UP ACROSS THE LOT.  I RAN TO THE VEHICLE, OPENED THE DRIVERS DOOR AND TRIED TO STEP ON THE BRAKE (FROM OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE), BUT THE DRIVERS DOOR KNOCKED ME DOWN, RUNNING OVER MY LEFT ANKLE. IN THE FALL, I BROKE THE LITTLE FINGER ON MY LEFT HAND.  ANOTHER GAS STATION PATRON WAS ABLE TO JUMP IN MY JEEP AND APPLY THE BRAKES AS I LAY WRITHING ON THE GROUND.  THE NEXT DAY MY ANKLE WAS QUITE SWOLLEN AND BLACK AND BLUE, SO I WENT TO THE URGENT CARE. X-RAYS SHOWED NO BROKEN BONES IN MY FOOT, BUT REVEALED MY BROKEN LITTLE FINGER.  THE VEHICLE NEVER HIT ANYTHING.  I THOUGHT I MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN TO PUT THE VEHICLE IN PARK THROUGH MY ERROR (I KNEW I HAD PUT THE VEHICLE IN PARK), BUT RECENT EVENTS AND DEATHS CONCERNING THIS ISSUE WITH THE JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE HAS MADE ME REALIZE THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE SHIFTER.
ON TWO OCCASIONS WHILE STANDING IN MY GARAGE WITH THE JEEP PARKED AND NOT USED OR RUNNING FOR DAYS, THE INSTRUMENT PANEL SUDDENLY COMES ALIVE INSIDE THE VEHICLE WITHOUT OPENING THE DOOR, TOUCHING THE DOOR HANDLE, OR HAVING THE REMOTE KEY TRANSPONDER ANYWHERE NEAR THE VEHICLE (THEY WERE BOTH INSIDE THE HOUSE NOWHERE NEAR THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME AND I WAS MANY FEET AWAY FROM THE VEHICLE.) I CAN HEAR THE VEHICLE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM "BOOT UP" AND THEN SHUT BACK DOWN. I HAVE ON MANY OTHER OCCASIONS HEARD THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM "BOOT UP" AND POWER BACK DOWN WITHOUT THE DASHBOARD DISPLAY COMING ALIVE. ONCE AGAIN, NO KEY FOB WAS NEAR THE VEHICLE NOR THE DOOR OPENED OR TOUCHED WHEN I HAVE BEEN OUT IN MY GARAGE TO WITNESS THIS AND THE VEHICLE HAS NOT BEEN DRIVEN FOR DAYS.

SUNROOF SHATTERED WHILE DRIVING DOWN HIGHWAY ON 2015 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. SOUND OF LARGE CRACK THEN IT SHATTERED. TOOK IT TO CERTIFIED JEEP SERVICE PROVIDER (ANCIRA JEEP, SAN ANTONIO, TX) AND PAUL, THE SERVICE MANAGER, SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS AND SOMETHING MUST HAVE HIT IT. THERE'S NO WAY IT WOULD HAVE JUST EXPLODED. NOTHING HIT IT - IT SHATTERED DUE TO EXCESSIVE HEAT. I HAVE CALLED JEEP, WHO SAYS THEY MUST STAND BEHIND THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE DEALER AND IT IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE OR FAULTY PRODUCT ISSUE. IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX.

Passenger front seat headrest deployed while parked, no collision or accident, was parked in my driveway.
I was involved in a car crash accident on the freeway, I was hit by a Ford Raptor truck from the back (left side) and pushed against the median barrier (center division) bounced back and spun twice and while spinning I hit another vehicle. Through all this I had three impacts, but when I hit the center divider I bumped my head on the left side and while spinning I heard the sound of gas (and felt air also coming into the car on the side of my head)  but the side airbags never deployed. I suffered a head concussion and neck injury due to whiplash and bumping my head. I called the Jeep Company and claimed about the side/curtains airbags not deploying, they said they will  send someone to check the car and investigate, they also made me sign the order authorizing them to check the car and after doing the investigation they sent me a letter with a vague explanation and no copy of the report that supports it. This  needs further investigation, Jeep is not being cleared about this.
2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee started to have rough idle when stopped at light or parked. Turns out the VVT Solenoid (Front  #2 cylinder) went bad. Poor design by Jeep/Chrysler that could cause a safety concern and even internal damage to engine. The VVT Solenoid from (Hawk Chrysler Jeep in Forest Park, IL) cost $143.00 w/o tax part #5047897AC. Part and vehicle is available for inspection at anytime. My incident occurred on Oct 1, 2023 in the middle of intersection making a left turn when I experienced rough idle. The next day the check engine light came on triggered code P0302 misfire #2 cylinder. Normal vehicle cylinder misfire would be due to bad ignition coil, plug, vacuum leak or fuel injector but not Chrysler product. That's when I noticed an abundance of Jeep Grand Cherokee owners from 2016/2017 complaining about VVT Solenoid causing misfire and rough idle. Independent repair facility confirmed VVT Solenoid was faulty and caused rough idle issue. Please open a vehicle recall for 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee for faulty VVT Solenoid to cover owners repairs and parts to resolve this poor design by manufacturer.   Thanks!

On 4/14/2023 while getting tire rotation and other general maintenance done on my 2016 Jeep, I was informed by service Tec that my lug nuts on my Jeep were swollen and soon will not be able to remove or break, causing issues like tire rotation and general maintenance impossible and high risk of cracking and breaking.  This would cause the Jeep to lose its stability, at a higher speed, wheel could come off.  This could cause serious damage/injury or death if this happened.  I went to local Chrysler dealer in Turnersville and spoke with parts department. They stated each lug bolt cost $18.00 each.  I need 20 to replace defective ones.  Chrysler parts rep suggested I call Chrysler customer service who he believes would send replacement bolts as these are steel and should not swell at all.  I did call and open a complaint with Chrysler recently this month, June.   I was just informed by Chrysler customer service that they deem this a warranty issue and not a safety issue and refuse to remedy or replace the defective lug bolts.  I’m asking for your assistance in this situation to help replace the defective lug bolts via Chrysler before a serious accident or injury happens.   I think it’s totally unacceptable that replacing these defective lug bolts cost $18.00 each and I’m being told to pay this , total cost is $360 for 20 lug bolts that are defective original Chrysler parts
I have only 78,000 miles on my 2016 jeep Grand Cherokee limited and I am having issues with ignition coil. The number 5 cylinder isn't working like it should.
Stopped at a red light and when it turned green, I pressed on the gas pedal and no acceleration. Looked at the dashboard and saw “Shift to P” the engine stalled and I had to roll out of the way of traffic, pressed the brake to a complete stop and restart the ignition/engine and was able to drive again.
WAS DRIVING ON THE ROAD WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE DASH BOARD LIGHTS STARTED BLINKING AS WELL AS GEAR LIGHT BY THE SHIFTER. LOST POWER AND COSTED TO A STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LEFT TURN LANE. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE ENCOUNTERED THIS PROBLEM SO FAR.
THE VEHICLE HAS HARD STARTS, AND OCCASIONALLY SHUTS OFF WHILE DRIVING WHEN THE VEHICLE START AND STOP SWITCH IS ON IT WILL SHUT OFF WHEN YOU STOP AND WILL NOT TURN ON UNLESS YOU PUT IT IN PARK AND START IT UP.
I WAS DRIVING ALONG AND APPARENTLY MY BATTERY IN MY KEYFOB WENT DEAD. MY ENGINE STOPPED WHILE I WAS DRIVING AND IF I WON'T HAVE HAD JUST BOUGHT A NEW BATTERY I WOULD HAVE BEEN STRANDED. THERE IS NO WAY TO START THE ENGINE WITH  KEY
WHILE DRIVING AND TURNING IN DRIVEWAY IT STALLED ON THREE OCCASIONS, WAIT TEN SECONDS, PUT IT IN PARK AND IT STARTS UP.  BEEN IN THE DEALERSHIP (WILLIAMSBURG VA JEEP INVOICE # 150495&151000) TWICE, CONTACTED JEEP CUSTOMER CARE (CAST #58123405) TO NO AVAIL. DEALERSHIP STATED THE ONLY WAY TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM WOULD BE A PROCESS OF ELIMINATION AND THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE AUTHORIZED BY JEEP, WHICH IT WASN'T.
DIESEL ENGINE JUST SHUTS OFF. TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP: CODE P016F-00 WAS STORED. BUT NOTHING WAS DONE TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM AS THE CAR STARTED BY THE TIME IT GOT TO THE DEALERSHIP. DIAGNOSTICS PERFORMED AT KERNERSVILLE DODGE, KERNERSVILLE, NC 27284 PH: 336-996-4111 INVOICE: DOCS402929 INVOICE DATE: 05/15/2018
DEATH WOBBLE WHEN BEING TOWED    THE DEALER IS NO HELP ON THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE A SERVICE BULLETIN ON THE 2016 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE, BUT THERE ON 2014 AND 2015 CHEROKEE. I NEED TO GET JEEP TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. 2016 IS FIRST YEAR FOR GRAND CHEROKEE TO HAVE ELECTRONIC STEERING WHICH WAS THE CAUSE OF THE SAME THING HAPPENING. 2014 - 2015 JEEP FIXED IT WITH A NEW HARNESS ADAPTER THAT SEND POWER TO THE STEERING WITH THE IGNITION OFF.    JEEP SAID WHEN ENOUGH PEOPLE COMPLAIN WE THEN MAY COME UP WITH A SIMILAR FIX". ONLY HAS HAPPENED TO A FEW GRAND CHEROKEES. THIS OF COURSE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ME. THIS IS BAD AND NEED TO BE ADDRESS ASAP. THIS COULD CAUSE A CRASH AND SOMEONE COULD GET KILLED.   WHEN THE JEEP IS BEING TOWED  AND YOU HIT BUMP WHILE TURNING IT STARTS WOBBLING FROM SIDE TO SIDE SO BAD IT WILL CAUSE YOU TO NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE TOWING VEHICLE.  ONCE YOU STOP AND THEN TAKE OF IT STOPS WOBBLING.
THE CAR OPERATED WELL AT FIRST START.  EARLY IN THE DAY, IT DROVE 30+ MILES.  AFTER BEING PARKED FOR 6+ HOURS IN A FLAT PUBLIC PARKING LOT, IT WAS TURNED ON AND PUT INTO REVERSE TO BACK OUT OF THE STALL.  UPON LIGHTLY RELEASING THE BRAKE, THE CAR ACCELERATED AT A HIGH SPEED (APPROX 20MPH) AND HIT A PARKING PILLAR. A LARGE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE WAS DONE TO THE BACK END, INCLUDING BUMPER, HATCH, SAFETY REINFORCEMENT BAR AND FLOOR BOARD ALL HAD TO BE REPLACED.
I RECEIVED A RECALL FROM CHRYSLER/JEEP IN REGARD TO THE BRAKE/TRANSMISSION SHIFT INTERLOCK SOLENOID WHICH MAY HAVE AN INCORRECTLY CRIMPED ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR. THIS COULD LEAD TO THE TRANSITION GEAR BECOMING LOCKED IN PARK OR NEUTRAL POSITION AND CAUSE A CRASH WITHOUT WARNING. I RECEIVED THE RECALL IN JUNE 2016. JEEP OF WHITE PLAINS, NY TOLD ME THAT SERVICE DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH PARTS AND WOULD PLACE ME ON A WAITING LIST. IN AUGUST, I CONTACTED THEM AGAIN AND THEY EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS NOW A SOFTWARE ISSUE AND MY CAR WOULD ONLY REQUIRE A DOWNLOAD. WHEN I BROUGHT THE CAR IN ON 8/31, THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY COULD NOT SERVICE THE VEHICLE BECAUSE IT DOESNT REQUIRE A DOWNLOAD (I WAS GIVE THE WRONG INFO), THE PART IS NOT  AVAILABLE AND I WILL HAVE TO BE PLACED ON A WAITING LIST AGAIN. WAITING OVER 3 MONTHS FOR A RECALL IS FAR FROM TIMELY.
THIS IS A FOLLOW ON TO A COMPLAINT FILED A FEW WEEKS AGO. I CAME HOME FROM A BUSINESS TRIP ON 4/5/2016. I STARTED THE JEEP IN THE DAILY GARAGE AT BWI AND WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON FOR THE STABILITY CONTROL AND ENGINE. THE GEAR INDICATORS (P, N, D, ETC.) WERE FLASHING AND IT DID NOT RECOGNIZE WHAT GEAR IT WAS IN. IT WOULD NOT ENGAGE A GEAR, AND WOULD NOT TURN OFF THE ENGINE. I HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALER AND LEFT IT OVERNIGHT STILL RUNNING. THE DEALER FINALLY GOT IT TURNED OFF BY PULLING A SENSOR ON THE FUEL PUMP. AS OF TODAY, 4/28, IT IS STILL IN THE SHOP. THEY HAD REPLACED THE VALVE TUB BUT IT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. THEY ARE NOW PLANNING TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE TRANSMISSION, SUPPOSEDLY IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, BUT AS OF TODAY JEEP HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT. IT HAD JUST OVER 500 MILES ON IT WHEN IT FAILED, BRAND NEW, AND HAS NOW BEEN IN THE SHOP LONGER THAN I'VE OWNED IT.
The contact owns a 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The contact stated while driving at approximately 40 MPH, the vehicle shuddered abnormally. The check engine warning light was illuminated. The vehicle was taken to a dealer to be diagnosed; however, the diagnostic result was unknown. The vehicle was repaired; however, the failure persisted. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The failure mileage was unknown.
On [XXX], I was involved in an accident in Maryland while driving my 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee. It was raining and despite attempting to slow down, brakes performed poorly, causing my car to skid and collide with the vehicle in front of me. Fortunately, no one else was injured, but I sustained a neck injury, and my car was ended up a total loss. During the accident, I noticed the ABS warning light had activated. This, combined with prior experiences of delayed brake response, raised concerns about the vehicle’s safety. Having derive. For over 15 years without incidents, this was my first major accident and I suspect it may be linked to a mechanical issue. After learning about recent calls related ABS/brake issues in Jeep vehicles, I felt it was important to report my experience. I urge you to re-evaluate the safety of the 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee’s ABS and braking systems to prevent similar incidents in the future. Thanks   INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
The rear differential keeps failing has been replaced 5 times in 3 years. When it fails it causes a lot of the safety features to disable, additionally it greatly affects the stability and handling of the vehicle. When this fails it’s an extremely difficult time driving the jeep and it’s quite dangerous due to the car not being stable.
I was on the highway and the vehicle shut off.  On another incident I was driving the vehicle and the power steering wen out on the vehicle.  On another incident after the power steering went out the vehicle put a notice on the dash to put the vehicle in park when the vehicle was already in park.  I tried to turn the vehicle off and it would not allow me to do so.  Then after repaired multiple times the battery started to over charge to 21 voltage.  At this point, the vehicle is just not safe to drive.
Hello! its been 2 years since i bought my 2017 grand cherokee laredo, and I am reporting HUDSON CYRSLER RAM IN JERSEY CITY for selling car with mileage discrepancies,   I bought and paid for  the mileage that i did not use, in the mile showing in contract that i paid is 36,400 miles , the mileages of the car they give it to me is 41,900miles. The miles showing the stickers /pricelist when they selling is different mileages, and when i sign i noticed that this not match to the contract snd the car that they gave me, the car that i paid is with 36,400miles not for 40kmeage, this is odo meter fraud miles decrepamcy
Driving down the highway and power/acceleration did not work. I had to cross lanes of traffic to pull over the vehicle.
Battery vent tube disconnected from the battery causing toxic gas to leak into the passenger compartment. Driver had been experiencing worsening feeling of suffocation for several months prior to discovery of the issue, which was found when replacing the original battery. Vent tube was reconnected and symptoms resolved completely within 72 hours. Approximately 6 weeks later, driver began experiencing the same symptoms, checked the battery vent tube and found that it was once again disconnected. Retaining feature does not appear sufficiently to retain the vent tube throughout vehicle life. Vehicle has less than 40,000 miles.

SERVICE SHIFTER COMES ON NOW AND MY FRIENDS CAR DID THIS WHILE DRIVING LOCKED UP HER WHEELS LOST CONTROL AND WAS LUCKY NOT TO GET INTO A DEADLY WRECK 2017 JEEP06 GRAND CHEROKEE
ABOUT A YEAR AGO I WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO PUT GAS IN MY CAR UNLESS I INVERTED THE HANDLE OF THE PUMP.  I FINALLY TOOK IT TO DODGE TO GET IT FIXED.  I HAD A PREVIOUS DODGE VEHICLE THAT HAD A SIMILAR ISSUE WITH THE FILLER NECK AND IT WAS FIXED ON A RECALL.  I WAS EXPECTING THIS TO BE THE SAME, BUT THE DEALER TOLD ME IT WAS A BAD GAS TANK AND NEEDED REPLACING FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS.  THEY REPLACED THE GAS TANK AND IT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM!  NOW THEY ARE SAYING CHRYSLER IS BLAMING THE GAS PUMPS, AND THEY HAVE NO SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM, AFTER CHARGING ME FOR A NEW GAS TANK!  THEY NEED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM WITH THEIR DESIGN, AND FIX IT VIA RECALL, AND REIMBURSE ME FOR UNNECESSARY REPAIRS WHICH DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.  I HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT MANY CARS ARE COMING IN WITH THIS PROBLEM INCLUDING DURANGOS.  I ALSO HAVE A 2020 JEEP I JUST BOUGHT AND THAT VEHICLE HAS HAD THIS SAME ISSUE A FEW TIMES.
TOUCH SCREEN NOT WORKING. IT IS ON BUT WHEN YOU TRY TO DO SOMETHING DOES NOT RESPOND TO TOUCH.
D   AND  R  ON TRANSMISSION   BLINKS     THEN STALLS. WHILE ON REVERSE, DOES NOT REVERSE.  WHILE ON D,  STALLS, HAVE TO PUT IT BACK  TO PARK AND RE-START ENGINE. TOOK TO DEALER,  THEY CAN NOT FIND ANYTHING,  FOR ME TO WAIT TILL MAL   SIGNAL COMES ON  IN ORDER FOR THEM TO FIND CODE.  DANGEROUS, AS I ALREADY WAS STUCK TWICE IN TRAFFIC. ONLY HAS 24000 MILES.
THE VEHICLE'S AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION HAS HAD 6 INCIDENTS WHERE IT HAS NOT SHIFTED PROPERLY:    3 TIMES IT HAS BEEN STUCK IN 1ST GEAR AND NOT AUTOMATICALLY SHIFTED TO HIGHER GEARS. EACH TIME THIS HAPPENED WHEN PROCEEDING FROM A FULL STOP WHEN THE TRAFFIC LIGHT CHANGED INTO AN INTERSECTION, WITH THE GEAR SELECTOR IN D. EACH TIME I HAD TO QUICKLY PUT THE GEAR SELECTOR IN N AND BACK INTO D TO REMEDY THIS.    2 TIMES, WHILE AGAIN STOPPED AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT WITH THE GEAR SELECTOR IN D, I STEPPED ON THE ACCELERATOR WHEN THE LIGHT CHANGED,  BUT THE VEHICLE JUST REVVED AND DID NOT MOVE. I CHECKED THE GEAR SELECTOR AND IT WAS STILL IN D, BUT WOULD STILL ONLY REV AND NOT MOVE. AGAIN, AS ABOVE, I PUT THE GEAR SELECTOR IN N AND BACK INTO D. ONLY THEN WOULD THE VEHICLE DRIVE.    JUST LAST WEEK, I WAS ATTEMPTING TO PARALLEL PARK ON THE STREET. I PUT THE GEAR SELECTOR IN R TO BACK INTO THE EMPTY SPACE. NO VEHICLES WERE BEHIND MINE, NOR ANY ON MY LEFT. I STEPPED ON THE ACCELERATOR, BUT THE ENGINE JUST REVVED, THE VEHICLE DIDN'T MOVE. I TRIED AGAIN AND AGAIN, BUT IT JUST REVVED. I PUT THE GEAR SELECTOR IN D, WENT A LITTLE FORWARD, THEN PUT THE SELECTOR IN R. THIS TIME THE VEHICLE DID MOVE IN REVERSE.    THESE INCIDENTS HAPPENED OVER THE PAST 2 YEARS. THE VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT MCKEVITT CHRYSLER JEEP DODGE IN BERKELEY, CA TO DIAGNOSE AND REPAIR THIS RECURRING ISSUE. THIS IS THE 3RD TIME I HAVE BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO THIS DEALERSHIP FOR THIS SAME ISSUE. THE PREVIOUS TWO TIMES, THEY WERE UNABLE TO FIND THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM.    I HAVE FOUND THAT 20 OTHER OWNERS OF 2017 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEES HAVE REPORTED SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ON THE CAR REPAIRS.COM WEBSITE:    HTTP://M.CARCOMPLAINTS.COM/JEEP/GRAND_CHEROKEE/2017/TRANSMISSION/
TAKATA RECALL. WAS DRIVING WITH KIDS AND WIFE I BEGAN COMING TO A STOP AND WAS GOING ABOUT 10 TO 15 MPH WHEN THE CAR STALLED OUT. IT SHUT OFF AND THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKED UP ALONG WITH THE BREAK PEDAL WAS NONOE FUNCTIONAL AS WELL AS THE GAS PEDAL AND THE GEAR SHIFT. THE CAR WOULD NOT GO BACK INTO PARK AND LEFT ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD FOR ABOUT 4 MINUTES. I FINALLY GOT IT INTO PARK AND THEN IT WOULDN'T START FOR A FEW MINUTES. THIS ALL HAPPENED ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY IN MY AREA. IT FINALLY STARTED AND WE TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AS IT IS PRETTY MUCH BRAND NEW. (33K) ON THE VEHICLE. THE DEALERSHIP HAS RAN TEST AND HAS TOLD ME THAT THERE IS A 2018 JEEP IN THE SAME PLACE DOING THE SAME THING. WE HAVE HAD THE CAR THERE FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND THEY SAY THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT AND NOW WE HAVE TO COME PIC IT UP. SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY WRONG WITH THE JEEP AS WE WAS IN MOTION, COMING TO A STOP AND WAS NOT TURNING. I WOULD SAY IT'S A LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION.
BOUGHT MY 2017 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE TRAILHAWK USED WITH 10,600 MILES ON IT.      GAS ISSUES FROM THE GET GO:  WHEN GETTING GAS, THE GAS PUMP SHUTS OFF EVER FEW SECONDS LIKE THE GAS TANK IS FULL ONLY ALLOWING A FEW CENTS WORTH OF GAS TO ACTUALLY GO IN THE VEHICLE.  I HAVE BEEN TO MULTIPLE GAS STATIONS AND THE SAME ISSUE OCCURS AT ALL OF THEM, TRIED TURNING THE NOZZLE TO DIFFERENT ANGLES AND ALMOST HOLDING IT ALL THE WAY OUT OF AND IN THE TANK, IT DOES NOT MATTER THOUGH.    AIR SUSPENSION:  AFTER OWNING THE JEEP FOR 3 MONTHS, ONE MONDAY MORNING WHEN I TURNED IT ON TO GO TO WORK A MESSAGE POPPED UP SAYING "SERVICE AIR SUSPENSION SYSTEM IMMEDIATELY", MILEAGE WAS AT 14,990.  I TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF AND ONE TWO MORE TIMES BEFORE DRIVING IT, DROVE TO WORK AND RESTARTED IT AFTER I PARKED, EACH TIME THE SAME MESSAGE CAME ON IMMEDIATELY.  I CALLED THE CLOSEST JEEP DEALERSHIP, THEY SAID IT WAS OK TO DRIVE AND COULD NOT SEE THE JEEP UNTIL THE FOLLOWING MONDAY.  DROPPED THE JEEP OFF, THEIR SYSTEM SAID THE MODULE WAS BAD, THEY REPLACED IT, THIS DID NOT WORK.  THEY CONTACTED CHRYSLER, NO FIX HAS OCCURED, MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS BUT NOTHING HAS WORKED.  3.5 WEEKS AND STILL COUNTING WITHOUT MY JEEP.  THE JEEP GARAGE SAID THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER BC THEY DO NOT KNOW THE SOLUTION AND ARE WAITING ON JEEP ENGINEERS TO TELL THEM WHAT TO TRY NEXT.  SOUNDS LIKE THE ENGINEERS ARE JUST TRYING EXPERIMENTS TO SEE WHAT WILL WORK.    WHEN WAITING ON THE MODULE TO COME IN THE FIRST WEEK I ASKED IF I COULD DRIVE IT UNTIL THE PIECE CAME AND WAS TOLD IT WAS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE.  VERY UNPLEASED.
ENGINE CAUTION LIGHT CAME ON WHILE DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE 5, CALLED DEALERSHIP FOR GUIDANCE I WAS INFORMED THAT AS LONG AS THE ENGINE WARNING LIGHT DOES NOT BLINK IT WILL BE OKAY TO DRIVE.  I SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT FOR A WEEK LATER. WITHIN THE WEEK THE CAR WOULD NOT STAY IN REVERSE AND LATER IT KEPT ON POPPING OUT OF REVERSE.  I ALSO NOTICE THAT THE GEAR WAS NOT CHANGING PROPERLY AND SEEMS TO STRAIN TO DRIVE.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN FOR A LOOK AT AND INFORMED THE SERVICE SUPERVISOR OF THE REVERSE CONDITION AND THAT THE "R" IN THE SHIFTER KEPT ON BLINKING.
Every time the vehicle proceeds over a speed bump or a dip in the road, it feels as if something is lose and banging in the steering and suspension of the vehicle. I have taken it to the dealer on numerous occasions, and they say they can never find anything wrong nor duplicate the issue. I’m concerned that at some point something may fail and I may lose control of the vehicle.
As many others have reported, only 56K miles on this 3.6L Grand Cherokee.  When I engage the passing gear an auto stop/start light comes on on the dash followed by the check engine light.  Vehicle rides very rough (from a misfire).  Taken to an independent shop; they changed plugs and coils but the problem persists.  Also a knocking / ticking noise can be heard when accelerating.
I have been experiencing slow crank issues for months now. The vehicle will have a slow crank then start. If it does not start on the first try, it will start on the second attempt. This concerns me as I've read many complaints regarding high pressure fuel pump issues on Jeep Grand Cherokees.  I am concerned about my safety especially being stranded at night time. I was told I need to change the fuel pump. I called the dealership and was also told that many Jeep Grand Cherokees have been experiencing the same issue which was fixed by replacing the fuel pump. If many vehicles are experiencing the same problem, why is this not considered a recall?
UConnect screen delamination is causing "ghost touching" in system. Climate control, phone, music, vehicle controls - including air suspension settings, are all impacted depending on particular event. Some are just annoyance, some are safety concerns.  Air suspension height adjustments and off road settings can be controlled in the UConnect screens. THE ONLY way to lock the air suspension for towing or jacking (tire repair, oil change, etc.) is through the UConnect screens.   There are 1,000's of complaints about this system issue on Jeep forums, and I was surprised at the lack of NHTSA complaints when I logged in to see the status.  I have video's of the system ghosting on several different screens on different dates if you'd like to have them please provide a link to upload or an email to send them too.
Jeep uses a transmission manufactured by ZF. Jeep claims the transmission is "filled for life" and does not require any maintenance, and never requires the oil to be changed. ZF recommends the oil be changed every 50-75,000 miles. Many other car manufacturers that utilize ZF transmissions recommend that same interval. In fact, if you push Jeep to change your transmission oil, they suggest it will void your warranty. Preventative maintenance in the form of a transmission fluid change is necessary for the health and longevity of the vehicle.  Jeep is negligent in this matter.  When your transmission fails, you are thrust into "limp" mode, capping your speed at 15-20 mph. This occurred to me on the highway. I narrowly avoided being rear ended in traffic traveling 65+ mph.  My car has been babied, all factory recommended services have been done in a timely manner, I was not having any issues with the car at the time, and there were no symptoms, warning lights, etc at the time.
Air Bags Failed to Deploy During An Accident  Vehicle Hit A Tree  No Warning Lamps Prior To Accident  Vehicle Towed Due To Damage  Vehicle Deemed Totaled By Insurance Company
The computer system keeps intermittently saying the turn signal bulbs are out turning off the front signal when you want to use it.   The bulbs are a bunch of LED’s in the headlight and it shouldn’t turn off all of them even if one is out (they are all working properly regardless).   It seems to be a fault within the computer system either inside the headlight assembly or in the car.
I wasn’t able to get out of park and there was a message to service shifter.  It happened twice in one day and now the engine light is on.
The contact owns a 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The contact stated that after turning the vehicle off, the brake lights remained illuminated. The vehicle was taken to the local dealer who diagnosed that the Hydraulic Control Unit was faulty and needed to be reprogramed. The Hydraulic Control Unit was reprogrammed under NHTSA Campaign: 22V426000 (Service Brakes, Hydraulic) but the failure persisted. The cause of the failure was not yet determined. The manufacturer was notified of the failure, but no assistance was offered. The approximate failure mileage was 68,000.
My Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit was purchased new in 2018.  I am the only owner and primary driver.  In early 2020 I noticed some bubbling with the leather of the dashboard.  It continued to bubble up a little at a time until today, November 7, 2023 it is so bubbled up that the delaminated leather blocks the air vent that defrosts my windsheild; blocks completely any possibility of warm air reaching the windshield wipers.  In freezing weather conditions this becomes very dangerous.  I was driving in a blizzard down the freeway with very low visibility.  The only way I could see anything was to have the wipers going at full speed.  Because they were not receiving any warm air from the defrost vents they froze up in the closed position and would not move.  Due to freeway traffic and conditions I could not pull over but I could not see.  I nearly rear ended a vehicle in front of me and could not see to trade lanes and try to pull off.  I was able to roll down my window, grab and flip the wiper to get it moving WHILE DRIVING.  My front passenger was able to do the same and we continued to drive this way with our windows down until we could pull off.  Other drivers with functioning dashboards where the warm air was reaching the wiper area as intended were not having the same problem I was.   The delaminated leather is also a problem because my windshield will not defog on the lower half and visibility can be very poor.  This may not be as big a hazard but still is a hazard because of the reduced visibility.
Entire front leather dash has delaminated and separated by bubbling up from the original glue not holding.  Also, the exhaust resonators (both sides)  on my 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT is bad on both sides and blowing out fiberglass from my exhaust pipes all over the backside of my car.   I’ve read on multiple forms that several customers have encountered the exact same issues on their Jeeps as well.  Is this issue being addressed and covered by the manufacture? If so, I definitely would like this to be taken care of.
I was driving on the highway today and my driver side active headrest popped open for no reason forcing my head into a very awkward position.  I had to immediately exit to a gas station to adjust my seat because I felt very unsafe.
The navigation display in my jeep is starting to delaminate which is cause ghost touches and the screen will change on its own, mess with settings and it can cause serious safety issues and is distracting to the driver. This should be a recall and not the driver’s responsibility to fix.
8.4” unconnect touch screen radio is bubbling. This bubbling causes the touch screen to select randomly. It will change climate control setting, screen settings, turn the radio on, turn seat heaters on, manipulate the navigation system. This becomes a large distraction while on the road and is extremely dangerous. This is a known issue with these radios in several Jeep/Dodge/Chrysler/Ram models. We have taken the vehicle to the dealer and asked for this safety issue to be addressed. They have responded that we are responsible to fix at our own cost.
I am the original owner of a 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee with 45,000 miles on it (it is out of the warranty period). About 9 months ago, I notice a portion of the center screen becoming delaminated. Then about 4 months ago, the screen started to act up - ghost pressing certain areas of the screen, without me touching it (automatically turning up the volume, turning on heated seats (in Florida), changing audio sources, changing the gps, etc.). It's extremely distracting when I drive. Last week, it even dialed 911 on its own while I was driving it. I contacted Jeep Cares and was instructed to take it into a dealer for a diagnostic check. They are charging me $190 for this. Even when they find the screen defective, I'm fearful that I will be charged the $1,600-$2,000 to have it replaced. This is a very known issue among Jeep/Chrysler owner - many forums like this (https://www.jeepgarage.org/threads/display-screen-starting-to-delaminate.224391/) prove it. Even though I am out of warranty, I feel that this should be recalled and covered at no charge (including the diagnostic check) since it's a major safety issue. The screen was defective to begin with - and after driving it for a few year, the defects were finally known.  This needs to replaced ASAP before a severe accident takes place.
The Uconnect system laminate bubbles and as such, the system has a phantom buttom touch every few seconds. While driving, this results in an audible ding, the navagation no longer is visible, you are unable to use the backup cameras. I have also been in a situation where it turned on the seat and steering wheel heating and I was unable to turn it off. This is a very wide spread issue and is an incredible safety hazard when driving. It effectively makes it not possible to control the electronics of the vehicle while driving. I urge anyone reading this who does not think this is a huge issue to try driving one of these vehicles while this is happening.  I used to drive over 20K miles a year with my previous vehicle. This issue started a month after I bought this vehicle from Vroom. As such, I have driven less than 1,200 miles in 18 months. I am incredibly surprised that this has not been recalled yet.  I am trying to upload a video of it but it will not let me. This is a MAJOR problem.
What component or system failed or malfunctioned, and is it available for inspection upon request? - Power steering failed while driving with family in vehicle including pregnant wife and toddler.  How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk? The power steering turned off while driving and has been deemed defective. Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? Yes, the dealership confirmed it’s a rack and pinion issue and they are out of stock and on back order. I’m not the only one experiencing this. They also can’t fix my car without a part.  Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others? The dealership inspected it.  Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear? No.  The jeep only has 55000 miles on it. I take care of my cars. This issue is known and the part is $2000 not including labor.  I want my car fixed and I can’t get it fixed. I rely on this vehicle for my family. They can’t order the part nor find it. I am stuck without power steering. Not by choice.
Touchscreen display bubbling, delamination, malfunctioning during use, including during back up camera usage/display, navigation display, climate control malfunction.  Touchscreen malfunction including functions turning on and off by themselves, system has life of its own.  Display continues to show back up camera display even when driving forward commences (see photo).  Safety issues/Symptoms include radio changing volumes to extreme levels my itself during driving, back up camera while in use disappearing and screen going blue, navigation system while in use changing to other functions without user input.
Touch Screen De-laminiation.  Entertainment system started having ghost clicks without being touched while driving at highway speeds.  Started making phone calls, changing radio stations, turning HVAC on and off, depending on which screen I was on.  Could not turn off screen because the phantom touches would just turn it back on again.
For the last month of more, the infosystem would asked "Do you want to adjust your clock setting?".  If you say no takes you back to the same screen if you say yes it let you update it but then goes back to the same screen and keeps on blinking and making sounds (causing an audible driving hazard).  It would go away only to come back the next time you drive.              Now today it is changing stations would out me touching the screen and now when i turn on the radio the volume is set to max (almost caused an accident this morning when it cranked to max while driving).  Checked it it appears my uconnect system is up to date so not sure what else i could do.  Dealer will look it at for $150 bucks!!!
The Uconnect has delimanted and is causing the display to jump around.  Driving on the expressway the back-up camera kept coming on, the heat and warming features jump around, the Uconnect makes calls, it has tried calling the SOS number.  This is a known issue and Jeep should be working with their customers to fix.
My u-connect screen is delaminating and the glue is leaking out. This is causing the radio/MP3/GPS guidance to constantly change settings, stations & songs and causing me to play with it constantly while driving. It did put me in a situation once while driving in an unfamiliar area where I had to reset the map display like every 10 seconds to find my way out. I now use my old Garmin. Several times I almost ran into a vehicle ahead of me or started drifting into the other lane from the distraction. I now leave the entire radio off unless I want to change my heat/AC/fan settings.
The contact owns a 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The contact stated that while seated in the driver’s seat with the engine off, the driver’s seat headrest deployed without warning. The contact was struck in the head by the headrest but was not injured. The contact called the dealer and was given an appointment for a diagnostic test. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 70,000.
Electronic radio unit constantly flips around to different areas beeping all the time.  I think it is called phantom touches. It will change radio channels, affects climate control by turning up heat to 82 degrees, turns on backup camera while driving down the road at 70 miles an hour, constantly changes radio stations, doesn't allow you to use navigation system, plus many other things.  I believe this is a known issue as I have seen many complaints on the internet and my dealership also has customers complaining about their cars.  I have also made my dealership aware of the issue.  They say there is nothing they can do as there has been no recall.  There needs to be a recall on these as it is very dangerous to be driving when these things are occurring.  Very distracting and you are unable to do anything about it.  Sometimes you have to pull over and shut the car off and turn it back on to see if you can correct it but many times it keeps on doing the same thing.
My Jeep Grand Cherokee is having an issue known as "Screen Delamination". This is the radio unit and it causes "ghost touches" to happen all the time. I have done a lot of research on this issue, because Jeep will not replace the faulty unit, because I am not the original owner of the vehicle. I contacted Jeep and they told me they will not open a case for me since I was not the original owner. There are several jeep boards where owners are having the same issue. This issue causes the radio to change stations on its own, make phone calls by itself, change the settings in the system, control the AC functions. All this happens when no one is touching the screen or anything. I feel like since there have been so many complaints about this, that Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler should replace these units.
The contact owns a 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The contact received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 20V699000 (Engine and Engine Cooling) however, the part to do the recall repair was unavailable. The contact called the local dealer who stated that the parts were not available. The contact was placed on the waiting list. The contact stated that the manufacturer had exceeded a reasonable amount of time for the recall repair. The manufacturer was notified however, no further assistance was provided. The contact had not experienced a failure. Parts distribution disconnect.
The contact owns a 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The contact stated while driving 55 MPH, the vehicle inadvertently stalled and lost electrical power. The message "Check Your Transmission" appeared on the instrument panel. The contact stated he veered to the side of the road and was able to restart the vehicle after 20 minutes. The contact continued to drive the vehicle. The vehicle was taken to the dealer who diagnosed that no issues were found. The contact stated that the failure reoccurred while driving. The vehicle was taken to a second dealer Normandin Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram FIAT (900 Capitol Expressway Auto Mall, San Jose, CA 95136) who diagnosed that the alternator and water pump needed to be replaced. The vehicle was repaired; however, the failure reoccurred several times while driving with the vehicle becoming overheated. The vehicle was taken to a third dealer Huffines Chrysler Jeep Dodge RAM Plano (4500 W Plano Pkwy, Plano, TX 75093) who could not determine the cause of the failure. The contact referenced NHTSA Campaign Number: 18V524000 (Electrical System). The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The vehicle was not repaired. The approximate failure mileage was 13,500.
Component Malfunctioned: 8.4" Center display, it is available to inspect and there are many other vehicles with the same issue. The digitizer on the display is coming unglued (due to heat), it is causing the touchscreen to do things on its own like change the time, call people, switch radio stations.  Safety at Risk: While it may not seem like a safety issue outright, when those phantom touches happen is very distracting to the driver. In addition, after reading about other cases where the delamination is even worse, the glue that is essentially melting has been seen to start dripping on other components and wiring inside the center stack, like air conditioning and parking sensor control and traction control button.   Reproduced: This is a very well-known issue within the Jeep/FCA family of vehicles. I called their customer service and they were 100% aware, they were ready with a replacement option right away but at my cost. This is a manufacture defect and should be covered by FCA. I live in Cleveland, OH, the hottest it has gotten here is 90 degrees, this screen should have been tested well beyond that temp. If the glue is melting in this weather, it needs to be replaced as a recall.  Inspected: No, but I will give it to anyone to inspect. Mine is not as bad as others I have seen but I would like to get is replaced before it becomes an even bigger safety issue.   Warnings: No, the car itself does not realize anything is wrong, it thinks that a human being is touching the screen, so it is doing the commands it is given.
On 5/14/21 Stop/Start switch - Engine stalling while driving while on turnpike 65 mph. Situation could have turned to an accident easily. Afterwards engine started with warning light to service S/S-switch. No previous issues with the car (26,000 miles). After stop at the rest area, engine started normally  and no warning light. Currently waiting for a service appointment to dealership
WHEN FILLING THE GAS TANK, THE GAS PUMP CLICKS OFF CONSTANTLY. IT HAPPENS AT MULTIPLE GAS STATIONS AND WITH DIFFERENT STYLE PUMP HANDLES. I HAVE TO REMOVE THE GAS PUMP FROM THE TANK AND ROTATE IT IN ORDER TO PUT GAS IN MY VEHICLE. I'VE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALERSHIP TWICE FOR THIS ISSUE SINCE I BOUGHT THE JEEP NEW IN 2018. IT HAS BEEN HAPPENING CONSISTENTLY AND I'VE READ ABOUT OTHERS HAVING THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE CAPLESS GAS SYSTEM IN THIS PARTICULAR MODEL AND YEAR. THE DEALERSHIP DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO SOLVE THE ISSUE, I FEAR THAT I WILL BE IN A POSITION THAT I CAN NOT PUT GAS IN MY VEHICLE DUE TO THIS ISSUE.
WHILE SITTING IN MY JEEP (PARKED) I REACHED INTO THE BACK SEAT FROM THE DRIVER SEAT. THE DRIVER SIDE HEADREST POPPED RANDOMLY. I LOOKED UP HOW TO RESET IT AND IT APPEARS THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE SINCE 2014 DUE TO THE PLASTIC RETENTION CLIPS BREAKING AT RANDOM. SEEING AS HOW IT IS A SAFETY MEASURE TO REDUCE INJURY WHEN REAR ENDED I FEEL AS IF THIS IS SOMETHING JEEP SHOULD RECALL SINCE THIS HAS BEEN A REOCCURRING PROBLEM FOR ALMOST 5 YEARS.
HERE ARE TIMES WHEN I HAVE PULLED OUT (WITH VARIOUS PEOPLE IN THE CAR) MOST RECENTLY MY 13 YEAR-OLD-SON, WHO WAS SCREAMING, "DAD WHAT ARE YOU DOING, WE ARE ABOUT TO BE HIT," AND THE CAR HAS COMPLETELY  SHUT DOWN. (NO INTERIOR LIGHTS, OR RUNNING ENGINE)  QUICK THINKING SAVED US FROM A MAJOR DISASTER.  WE WERE ALMOST T-BONED LAST WEEK BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM.  THIS WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST TIME                        FOR THIS PROBLEM.    PROBLEM #3:  WHILE DRIVING, I PULLED OUT FROM MY STREET, A RED LIGHT OR PARKING LOT AND THE TRANSMISSION DID NOT ENGAGE, THE ENGINE REVVED (WITHOUT MOVING) AND AGAIN, I WAS ALMOST T-BONED.  IT HAPPENED AGAIN THIS MORNING.   PROBLEM #4:  THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I AM TRAVELING UP OR DOWNHILL, THE TRANSMISSION WILL WIND OUT, THE TACHOMETER WILL SPIKE AND THEN THE JEEP MAKES A KNOCKING NOISE AND THEN I CAN CONTINUE.  YOU COULD DRIVE THE CAR FOR MONTHS AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT HAPPENS.    PROBLEM #5:  I WAS BACKING INTO MY DRIVEWAY, THE BACK UP CAMERA STOPPED WORKING AND MY JEEP COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN. THIS HAPPENS ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION AND HAS NO PRECURSOR TO WHEN IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.  *TR
AN ISSUE RELATING TO ELECTRICAL OR POWER TRAIN CAUSES THE VEHICLE TO STALL  AND REMAIN IN A NO START CONDITION.  WITHOUT WARNING, THE VEHICLE IS COMPLETELY WITHOUT ELECTRICAL POWER WHILE DRIVING AND THE VEHICLE BECOMES UNABLE TO BE CONTROLLED.    THIS VEHICLE WAS MANUFACTURED 9/2018, PURCHASED 12/18.  THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE ON THE INTERSTATE AT A SPEED OF 45-55 MPH ON 5/31/18 AND AGAIN WHILE DRIVING AT 30-40 MPH ON A CITY STREET ON 10/18/19. BOTH OF THESE INCIDENTS WERE TERRIFYING AND THANKFULLY WE WERE NOT INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT.      THE ONLY SERVICE THAT HAS BEEN PERFORMED (OIL CHANGES AND THESE TWO ISSUES) WAS COMPLETED BY THE DEALERSHIP WHERE IT WAS PURCHASED.  BOTH TIMES THE VEHICLE FAILED, THE DEALERSHIP DISCOVERED THAT THE MASTER FUSE WAS "BLOWN" AND THE REPLACED IT.      THIS IS AN UNSAFE VEHICLE THAT I AM NOW FORCED TO PAY FOR AND DRIVE MYSELF AND MY CHILDREN AROUND IN NOT KNOWING WHEN IT WILL SHUT OFF AND I WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE OR MOVE FROM THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC.      WHEN CALLING THE MANUFACTURER, I WAS TOLD THAT THE RECALL NUMBER U87 / NHTSA ID 18V524000 DID NOT INCLUDE MY VIN NUMBER ALTHOUGH THE DESCRIPTION IS EXACTLY THE SAME.  THIS RECALL EXPLAINS THAT THE DEALER SHOULD REPLACE THE POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE BECAUSE IT MAY BE EQUIPPED WITH A VOLTAGE REGULATOR CHIP IN THE CIRCUIT BOARD THAT MAY FAIL CAUSING A STALL OR NO START CONDITION AND POTENTIALLY CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO STALL WHILE DRIVING AND CAUSE A RISK OF CRASH.      YET, THE DEALERSHIP IS UNWILLING TO DO ANYTHING TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE BECAUSE THE RECALL DOES NOT INCLUDE THIS VIN.   THE MANUFACTURER REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS ISSUE AND THIS IS MY ONLY RECOURSE UNTIL THE ISSUE HAPPENS TWO MORE TIMES, I SURVIVE BEING IN AN INOPERABLE MOVING VEHICLE AND CAN FILE FOR LEMON LAW RIGHTS.
PARKING MY 2018 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE LAREDO IN A PARKING LOT.  MY FOOT WAS ON THE BREAK AND I WAS GETTING READY TO SHIFT JEEP INTO PARK WHEN THE JEEP SUDDENLY  ACCELERATED FORWARD HITTING A BUILDING.  TOOK JEEP TO DEALERSHIP AND THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING RECREATE THIS.  I HAVE OPENED A TICKET CHRYSLER/FIAT AND WAITING FOR THEM TO CONTACT ME.  I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THE JEEP NOW.
MY 2018 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR A FAULTY SOS FEATURE.  THE SOS DOES NOT CONNECT TO EMERGENCY SERVICES AND DOES NOT SHUT OFF.  THE SYSTEM STAYS ENGAGED UNTIL A FUSE IS PULLED IN THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT UNDER THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT.  MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS AND "STAR TICKETS" HAVE NOT PRODUCED CORRECTION AND STAR TICKETS CANCELLED MULTIPLE TIMES BY THE OEM.  THERE ARE SERVICE BULLETINS, BUT NOTHING IS RESOLVING THIS.  OEM NOT TAKING THIS AS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  IF SOMETHING SHOULD OCCUR, THE VEHICLE'S SAFETY RESPONSE SERVICE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING FOR OCCUPANTS OF THE VEHICLE.  IT IS VERY UPSETTING THAT THE OEM HAS NOT FIXED A SOFTWARE ISSUE AND WILL NOT ALLOW THE DEALERSHIP TO REPLACE THE RADIO WITH ONE THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDES THE PROPER CONNECTION TO EMERGENCY SERVICES.  THIS IS A DEFECT IN THE PRODUCT THAT THE OEM HAS HAD OVER 18 MONTHS TO FIX SINCE THIS VEHICLE WAS MANUFACTURED.
ON 01/09/19 MY WIFE WAS INVOLVED IN A SINGLE VEHICLE ACCIDENT IN WHICH HER VEHICLE RAN OFF THE ROADWAY DOWN AN EMBANKMENT RESULTING IN THE VEHICLE SUSTAINING A TOTAL LOSS OF THE VEHICLE DUE TO DAMAGES.  THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED AS IT HIT SOME TYPE OF BARRIER WHICH DESTROYED THE UNDER CARRIAGE STRIKING TWO TREES BEFORE IT CAME TO REST ABOUT 300 YARDS OFF THE ROADWAY.     MY CONCERN IS THAT NONE OF THE AIRBAGS DEPLOYED IN THIS HORRIFIC ACCIDENT WHICH FORTUNATELY MY WIFE ONLY SUSTAINED MINOR INJURIES.
ON OCCASION, WHEN THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL IS PUSHED ALL OF THE WAY TO THE FLOOR, IT WOULD GET STUCK UNDER THE FLOOR MAT. THIS HAS HAPPENED ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION. IT IS VERY DANGEROUS WHEN IT HAPPENS BECAUSE THE VEHICLE IS AT FULL THROTTLE AND THE BRAKES WILL NOT OVERCOME THE ENGINE. I'VE RESOLVED THE PROBLEM IN MY VEHICLE BY REMOVING THE FLOOR MAT. I CALLED JEEP CARES AND WARNED THEM OF THIS PROBLEM AND THEY SAID TO TAKE TO A DEALERSHIP TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT. THEY'VE KNOWN ABOUT IT FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS. I'M REPORTING THIS WITH THE HOPE THAT YOU WILL LOOK INTO THIS AND GET A WARNING OUT BEFORE SOMEONE GETS INJURED OR KILLED.

As I was sitting in the back part of my jeep in the hatch out of nowhere the car shook and a large bang went off. I searched the car to find out what happened I couldn't figure it out.  later when I got home my son noticed that the driver side headrest looked funny. I checked it myself and saw that the driver side air bag on the headrest deployed itself. My car has not been in any accident and the air bag deployed on its own. When I took my car for a routine oil change. I was informed that it's not jeeps responsibility and I didn't have any warranty coverage.
JEEP grand Cherokee’s are know for their faulty transmissions, I just bought a 2019 jeep grand Cherokee from the dealer and it has a faulty transmission. I’ve research and found out that other owners have same issues. This issues cause the car to jerk forward going from 2nd to 1st gear. This can be an issue because the jerk is strong and can cause an accident when stopping. Please help us out with this issue as it is a safety concern. Thank you!
The contact owned a 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The contact received NHTSA Campaign Number: 22V426000 (Service Brakes, Hydraulic).

Power rear liftgate top attachment stud holding the power drive to the body of the vehicle sheared off, causing the very heavy liftgate to come crashing down. Fortunately I was able to jump back. The liftgate probably weighs about 150 pounds. It seem that a small 1/4" stud that holding this in place is not adequate for the load.   There does seem to be some Internet discussion of this happening to others. This vehicle only has 40,000 miles on it.
Recall on this vehicle that the dealer is unable to repair at this time. It poses a safety risk as the car can potentially shift out of break without knowing .

SO FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN DRIVE, IT WILL 'SPIT' WHEN IT'S IN GEAR. LIKE I'LL PUSH ON THE GAS AND IT WILL GO BUT SOMETIMES IT WILL STALL AND THEN GO AGAIN. IT STOPPED DOING THAT FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS BUT TODAY I WAS REVERSING OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY AND IT SAID 'SHIFT TO P BEFORE PUTTING IN GEAR' (KEEP IN MIND THE CAR WAS IN REVERSE). AND THE CAR WAS 'SPITTING' AS I WAS IN REVERSE. I CHECKED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS COMPLETELY IN THE REVERSE GEAR AND IT WAS. SO I PUT IT IN PARK AND THEN REVERSE AND IT WAS FINE AFTER THAT. BUT I SAW THIS POST ON FACEBOOK NOT LONG AGO, A WOMEN HAD I BELIEVE A 2017 JEEP CHEROKEE, SHE WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AND HER CAR POPPED UP A NOTIFICATION 'SHIFT TO P'. RIGHT AFTER THAT HER CAR AUTOMATICALLY STOPPED AND SHE WRECKED. MY CAR SAID THE SAME THING TO ME THIS MORNING WHILE I WAS IN REVERSE. THERE IS NO RECALL ON MY VEHICLE AS OF NOW, AND I AM SCARED FOR MINE AND MY FAMILIES SAFETY. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS.
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM HAS A WEATHER ALERT NOTIFICATION THAT CAN'T BE DISABLED. IT TAKES UP THE ENTIRE INFOTAINMENT SCREEN AND DOES NOT GO AWAY UNLESS I TAKE MY EYES OFF THE ROAD TO CLICK ON IT TO CLOSE THE WINDOW. THIS HAPPENS EVERYDAY IN MY JEEP WITH A WIND ADVISORY. PRETTY ABSURD NOTIFICATION ESPECIALLY SINCE IT HAPPENS EVERY DAY. I LIVE ON THE WEST COATS AND UNDERSTAND IT CAN BE WINDY. SUPER DANGEROUS TO CONSTANTLY POP UP AND MAKE ME CLOSE IT MANUALLY.
STOP/START SYSTEM WARNING LIGHT  WHEN THE CAR WAS STATIONARY AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT THE CAR TURNS OFF AT STOP LIGHT AND DOES NOT RESTART AS IT IS SUPPOSED TO WHEN THE ACCELERATOR IS PUSHED. ALL ITEMS ON THE SHIFT INDICATOR BEGIN TO FLASH. CAR MUST BE TURNED OFF AND RESTARTED.  THE STOP/START SYSTEM WARNING LIGHT STAYS ON. THIS HAS HAPPENED THREE TIMES AND IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.

Issue #1: The vehicle exhibits substantial cabin vibration, particularly affecting the steering wheel. This necessitates maintaining a firm grip on the wheel when operating at speeds of 30 mph and above. The vibration intensity escalates in direct proportion to the vehicle's velocity. It has been reported that this vehicle model has documented issues with rear drive shaft bushing failure, which may contribute to excessive play and vibration.  Issue #2: The interior door trim applique has delaminated and broken. This issue has been previously reported in Service Bulletin 23-001-19 REV.B, Group: 23-Body, dated 8/10/2019, for a different Jeep model.
Air bag sensor went off, took it to the dealer and they said it could be a loose wire. I do not feel safe driving the vehicle since there has been a recall for prior models due to a faulty sensor which could cause the airbags to malfunction in case of an accident. Also having problems with the screen delaminating.
The front glass panel of the panoramic sunroof spontaneously shattered. The car was going approximately 45-50 mph when a loud "bang" was heard. Broken glass could be heard inside the closed sunroof liner. Upon inspection, there was no physical damage to the front end of the car, hood, or roof indicating that something may have struck the car. An inspection of the sunroof showed a sizable hole in the middle of the sunroof glass panel with accompanying cracks in the sunroof safety glass. The car can be inspected upon request.   The safety of the driver and passengers could have been compromised if the sunroof shade/liner was retracted.  The problem has not been reproduced although the dealer has confirmed that incidences such as this have occurred.  The vehicle has not been inspected at this time, but an inspection is scheduled.  There were no warning lamps or other notifications alerting the driver to the malfunction

The failure mileage was approximately 56,165.
When I put my 2020 Jeep Grand Cherokee in reverse, the backup camera displayed on the screen like normal. However, once I shifted into drive the backup camera image was frozen on the display. It wasn’t until I powered off the radio and back on that it went away. This is a safety issue because it caused a distraction to me while I was in drive trying to figure out what was going on. I also took a video that clearly shows my jeep was in drive while the backup camera image was still frozen on the display.
The vehicle Uconnect Radio Unit has malfunctioned since I purchased the vehicle, and the rate of the malfuctions have increased in frequency and duration, and now are impacting different functions of the vehicle such as the Back Up Camera, Navigation, GPS, Heat & Cooling Seat Options, Radio, Blue Tooth, etc.  (this head unit [radio] controls, the Navigation, GPS, Backup Camera, Radio, Heated Seat, Cooling Seat.

I WAS AT A RED IGHT, ON A BUSY ROAD. THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN, I WAS THE FIRST CAR STOPPED IN THE TURNING LANE. THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN,AND AS I TURNED, THE CAR   INTO THE LANE, IT ROLLED FOWARD FOR A SECOND WHEN I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE, THEN IT LEPT FORWARD, STALLED, THEN SAID ON THE DISPLAY THAT THE CAR NEEDED TO BE PUT IN PARK BEFORE STARTING THE ENGINE. I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION GOING ACROSS ONCOMING TRAFFIC.
When starting car, the push to start feature will not turn over and continuously cranks multiple times. The entire fuse box was replaced because the dealer told me that was the issue. The car is a 2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo. Numerous people online said they were forced to replace the fuel pump? Although Faulkner Buick in Trevose told me that there’s nothing wrong with my fuel pump. I can’t keep getting charged for repairs that are not necessary. Could this be a faulty part? that so many people have the same issue? Could you please investigate this as I just bought the car a month ago And it’s been at the dealer three times already. Thank you.
I was driving down the highway and all of the sudden and with zero warning the engine cut off but the effect it had on the car was very severe engine braking as it automatically downshifted very aggressively which caused me to go from about 80mph to a stop VERY quickly. The dash looked as if I simply had the car switched to on without starting the engine. There were no warning lights lit. Shifting into park and turning the car completely off and back on allowed it to start again with no further symptoms.
The contact owns a 2021 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The contact stated that the power steering failure warning light had illuminated. While attempting to steer the vehicle, the steering wheel felt loose while driving at various speeds and the vehicle was difficult to steer. The failure had become more persistent over time. The vehicle was taken to the dealer who diagnosed that the steering gear had failed and needed to be replaced. The dealer informed the contact that the failure was related to NHTSA Campaign Number: 23V352000 (Steering); however, the VIN was not included. The vehicle had been repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure and confirmed that the VIN was not included in the recall. The failure mileage was 58,000.
My low beam headlight has blown for the second time now since owning the car.  THIS IS NOT NORMAL!!!  There clearly must be some electrical issue and I’m past the warranty. Headlights don’t blow like that. I’ve owned cars for over 6 years and never had a headlight blow.
I was driving my usual route home from work during rush hour on [XXX] in Seattle, Wa when my sunroof glass exploded on my 2021 Grand Jeep Cherokee.  My first thought was that a tire had blown, it was so loud!  Experiencing no loss of control, I quickly realized that the sound was my sunroof glass disintegrating when I heard glass shards rattling overhead.  Thankfully my sliding visor was closed as I usually have this open.  Of course had it been open I would have had glass shower down on me causing an accident and possibly seriously damaging my vision!   I got home safely where I called my car insurance to report what happened.  I asked if they wanted me to send photos of the exploded sunroof glass they told me there was no need since it should be a simple fix.  Well it has not been so.  Insurance sent me to a local collision shop a few days later which turned me away since there was no collision.  I called several glass places after this myself and was told by each one they don't deal with replacing sunroof glass.  I contacted a Jeep dealership told them my situation, what had happened.  The dealership scheduled for me to come in 30 plus days for an inspection since that was first availability.  I called several dealerships to try to get seen earlier they were all a month out give or take for appointments.    Given the suddenness of the explosion and the apparent absence of any external cause, it seems to me that it was caused by a manufacturing flaw, or design defect, in the glass or its frame.  Although I am a longtime owner and fan of Jeep vehicles I find that this was unacceptable  since this is obviously a potential safety issue, as well as a major inconvenience.   I also feel Jeep should cover the expense on this!  I owned a Jeep Compass prior to my Grand Cherokee that had a sunroof and never had an issue.   I don't want this to happen to others and this goes for anyone who has a sunroof that this could happen without any warning.

On [XXX], while traveling on an interstate highway, I heard what sounded like a metal hitting metal coming from my left front tire.  After parking my car I noticed what appeared to be the left front Sway Bar Link had become disconnected. (I have attached pictures to this report). On Wednesday [XXX], The car was taken to a Jeep Dealership for Repairs (Sansone Auto Mall 90-100 Route 1 Avenel NJ 07001) where they replaced the front Sway Bar Link. The purpose of the Sway Bar is so the vehicle can maintain stability and control when operating/steering the car. Specifically if you have to make quick turns or evasive steering to avoid dangers in the road. My vehicle only has 19,000 miles and this part should not have failed as it did. At the time of the malfunction I was traveling on an interstate highway and fortunately was able to safely operate my car. There were no warning lamps or alerts prior to this incident. My safety was put at risk as I was on a major interstate and had I needed to make a quick lane change or avoid a sudden danger this failed part could have caused me to lose control of the car. The failed part was replaced by jeep dealership. Part #68409879-AA.   Link Stab 17029017 INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)

I WAS DRIVING ON THE RD BY 20 MILES PER HR WHEN I LOOSE ALL THE BREAKS IN MY JEEP! FOR SOME REASON I PRESS THE BREAK AND HE GET COMPLETE TO THE FLOOR AND MY DASH START BLINKING WAS VERY SCARY I WAS WITH MY DAUGHTER IF I DRIVING MORE FASTER MAYBE I'M NOT HERE TODAY! I'M DON'T TRUST ANYMORE ON THIS CAR AND I STILL PAY FOR SOMETHING THE I DO T FEEL SAFE
The entire Jeep failed. Every light, warning, service, etc came up when cranking, and then it went dead. Now, it will not crank at all. Additionally, the trunk will not open and no power pops up on dashboard or display. This is put my family at risk due to the vehicle being parked next to my home with a possible shortage. No one has confirmed or checked, due to it being a Saturday. No warning was given prior.
Within days after completing the 95b recall (24v-720) on my Grand Cherokee 4xe PHEV , the vehicle would periodically flash an error message saying ”service hybrid system” or something to that effect.  It would illuminate for just a few seconds.  On May 21, I took the vehicle back to the dealership (Brigham-Gill, Natick, MA).  They read several codes and after conferring with Jeep, said the vehicle is unsafe to drive. It has remained there parked in their backlot as of July 15.  The dealership is awaiting guidance from Jeep and informed me they have several others in the same situation.  So there were few issues here 1) if I hadn’t returned to the dealership to ask about these brief flashing messages, I would not have known that the vehicle was unsafe to drive. These messages never stayed illuminated for more than a few seconds, and there is no residual “check engine” light.  2) it is incorrect to say that the 95B recall addressed the issue of the failing batteries if it renders the vehicle in operable. 3) the 95B recall patch software was released in January 2025. I find it hard to believe that as of mid July they’ve been unable to find out why it doesn’t work in all the vehicles as intended. This leads me to question the thoroughness of the regression testing before it was released.
After software updates the language switches (English to Italian). The cluster and radio display settings revert back to default settings, auto door locks and paddle shifter becomes inoperative (with no menu to enable), the forward collision warning (fcw) lamp turns on stating that it is not working, with no way to fix, units of measurement including speed, temperature, etc. all change, and many other random settings change as well. The head unit will randomly restart.
I was parking in my sister's driveway and car just accelerated in to her house!
See attached document for complaint.
Dealer and Jeep have refused to provide a reasonable effort and make reasonable accommodations to address the 95B recall. Parking the vehicle outside endangers my neighborhood as we live near a national forest.
we have reported to the dealer multiple instances of noises (crunching and low thuds) and 'thumping' felt through floor boards coming from what appears to be front passenger side.  Dealer installed right from sway bar end link as well as subsequently perform NHTSA mandatory recall repairs on Front Upper Control Arm to Steering Knuckle Pinch Bolt.  After each 'repair' the problem appears to be getting worse (additionally we had the experience of the 'Sway Bar Disconnect Unavailable' light coming on while driving on a paved surface without having depressed the Sway-Bar button).  We brought the vehicle into the Dealer again and one of the Service Managers came for a ride and confirmed our complaints.  After a day of looking the Dealer stated that they are going to replace parts previously installed as they may have been defective.  Parts are on order but we are concerned for our safety in continuing to drive the vehicle, due not only the sounds we are hearing / feeling but after having researched complaints online (as there are many folks having similar experiences, it appears that Chrysler / Jeep still have more work to do on the safe operation of the vehicle .  thank you
The contact owns a 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee. The contact stated that while driving approximately 20 MPH, the rear tailgate door erroneously opened.

Upon startup power steering was disabled and the console message "power steering available service required". Blind spot detection and lane departure also showed as in-op. Wheel was very hard to turn.  After traveling a few hundred feet I determined that the car was not safe to drive.  After two vehicle restarts the problem cleared.  If this happened at speed, in traffic, a serious accident is likely.  Dealership is unable to look at problem for weeks.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE WHICH REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION FROM NHTSA!
Advanced brake assist / emergency assist issue - while highway driving, during a sunny day and with no cars for at least 1 mile the system engaged the emergency brake as if it detected an eminent accident.  This was at highway speeds so caused some commotion in the car.  Once safely stopped in a rest area I turned off that system. The next day the active lane management system stated it needed service, that later went away.  Moreover when the brake pedal is depressed the peddle pulses, leading me to believe the rotors are warped.  This suv only has 3300 miles on it.  It is scheduled to go to the dealership next week
While traveling on a 2 lane road with no one around the FCW system went off and emergency braked the car. No cars were anywhere to be seen. If someone had been behind me, I don't think they could have stopped.
When ever I fill the tank with gas I get leakage of fuel on my driveway so I have been filling it halfway and I don’t get the leakage it also has a fuel smell. I have found on the internet that this is common and the repair part is available, but I feel that this is very similar to the recall on Toyota trucks that is now on going so I feel it is my duty to report this safety situation
HEADLIGHTS STOP WORKING WHILE DRIVING BECAUSE JEEP KNOWS ABOUT A TIPM ISSUE BUT WILL NOT FIX IT.    TIPM issue. This issue is common and described across the web but is a safety hazard! The headlights will flash 3-5 times then completely shut off. Restarting the Jeep and disconnecting the battery does not help. Jeep dealer says circuit in the TIPM is the issue and that this is common! Lordy have mercy for all the vecs on the road when my headlights started flashing at them and then went out on, of course,  an unlit section of the road. But the crazier part is Jeep knew this could happen and doesn't warn the customers. I sure  did not know that I might be driving blind at night becoming a safety hazard. The lights then decide to not work for a few days before going back to being reliable for anywhere from weeks to months until you happen to drive at night again and bam they go out again. Luckily the runner/ fog lights are unaffected but as a primary vehicle I can not just keep taking ubers every time it is dark outside! This is such a serious safety issue to loose your lights while driving! There are two common fixes for this. One you buy the TIPM or two you buy non stock headlights and reroute them to your own switch but for most of us, buying a part that Jeep knows will break is crazy and not practical (plus WE the consumer didn't know it would) and the alternative of having to buy a different company's lights to buy pass the wiring in just crazy.  It is such a serious issue I do not understand why there is no recall! I'm also so unsure if I can even pass a safety inspection anymore.    Also the automatic fuel stopper does not work which is ANOTHER know glitch with the TIPM. This is okay if you know about it because you can hold the handle the whole time while filling up but you can not trust it alone. It isn't like it is all the time either. Just enough to keep you on your toes and plosion the ground with spillage. The first time is scary though.

AIR BAG LIGHT TURNS ON INTERMITTENTLY DURING VEHICLE OPERATION, MEANING THE AIR BAG WILL NOT DEPLOY IF THERE'S A COLLISION. SUSPECTED COMPONENT FAILURE IS THE CLOCKSPRING. THERE HAVE BEEN RECALLS ON OTHER YEARS OF JEEP WRANGLERS FOR THIS ISSUE, BUT NOT 2010 TO MY KNOWLEDGE.
MY VEHICLE HAS AN ISSUE WITH FUEL SPILLING OUT OF THE TANK AND ON TO THE GROUND EACH TIME I FILL UP. I DO NOT TOP OFF THE TANK NOR DO I USE THE FASTEST SETTING ON THE PUMP TO DELIVER THE FUEL. IT IS KNOWN ISSUE BY THE MANUFACTURER AND A WARRANTY BULLETIN HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR PREVIOUS MODEL YEARS. THE MANUFACTURER NOR THE DEALERSHIPS TAKE RESPONSIBLE ACTION ON REPAIRING THE SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE. THEY INSTEAD ASK CONSUMERS TO FRONT THE COSTS AND SAVE RECEIPTS IN THE EVENT A RECALL IS ISSUED IN THE FUTURE FOR REIMBURSEMENT. I AM WRITING THIS HOPES THAT YOUR AGENCY WILL INVESTIGATE AND ISSUE THE RECALL IF NECESSARY SO THIS PROBLEM CAN BE FIXED.
FUEL SPILLS OUT WHEN REFUELING VEHICLE.  NOZZLE AUTO SHUTS OFF THEN FUEL SPURTS OUT.  NO IDEA WHY, HAVE NOT CHANGED TYPE OF FUEL BEING USED ALTHOUGH IT IS NOW WINTER IN SPOKANE SO THE FORMULATION MAY HAVE CHANGED, DON'T KNOW.  IT IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION.
I HAVE A 2010 JEEP WRANGLER UNLIMITED SAHARA. MY WRANGLER AS A DEFECT ON THE TRANSMISSION CAUSING IT TO VIOLENTLY POP OUT OF FIRST GEAR WHILE TRYING TO ACCELERATE (EVERY SINGLE TIME). LOOKING INTO THE ISSUE, I HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS VERY COMMON WITH THE 2010 MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS, YET THERE HAS BEEN NO RECALL ISSUED REGARDING THE TRANSMISSION- EVEN THOUGH IT CAN BE DANGEROUS. BECAUSE OF THIS DEFECT, I HAVE TO START MY JEEP IN SECOND GEAR CAUSING EXTRA WEAR AND TEAR ON MY CLUTCH. ACCORDING TO MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP, IN ORDER TO FIX THE ISSUE, I WILL HAVE TO EITHER COMPLETELY REBUILD MY TRANSMISSION OR GET A NEW ONE (IN THE TSB THAT CHRYSLER PUT OUT REGARDING THE ISSUE, ONLY THE 1-2 SYNCHRONIZER ASSEMBLY NEEDS TO BE REPLACED TO REPAIR THE ISSUE.)  IT IS ABSURD THAT CHRYSLER HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THIS ISSUE, YET A RECALL HAS STILL NOT BEEN ISSUED.

THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED. THE VEHICLE WAS DRIVEN TO A MECHANIC, BUT WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE VIN WAS UNKNOWN. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 900.
TIPM PROBLEM. CODE READER CODES ARE B10EC BLOWER MOTOR OVER CURRENT, B219A IGNITION START/ LOCK UNLOCK OVER CURRENT. SUGGESTED FIX, REPLACE TIPM. QUOTED FROM JEEP TO REPAIR IS $1100.00
GAS TANK OVERFLOW ON EVERY FILLUP.  ON SOME PUMPS I CAN ONLY PUMP 1/3 OF A GALLON AT A TIME VERY SLOWLY.  IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THE CHECK VALVE IS HAVING SOME KIND OF ISSUE AS IS A WELL KNOWN PROBLEM IN THESE JEEPS.  THE DEALERSHIP WILL NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROBLEM AND CHARGES ALMOST DOUBLE WHAT A NEW TANK WOULD COST TO DIAGNOSE AND REPLACE THE TANK.
ON MY 2010 JEEP WRANGLER (LHD) DASHBOARD, THE AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT FLASHES ON EVERY OTHER MINUTE WITH A CHIME, AN INDICATION THAT THERE IS SOMETHING MALFUNCTIONING OR INTERFERING WITH THE VEHICLE'S AIRBAGS.  THIS IS HAPPENING WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STATIONARY AND WHILE IN MOTION EITHER ON THE HIGHWAY OR CITY ROADS. THIS IS CAUSED BY A FAULTY CLOCKSPRING WITHIN THE VEHICLE'S STEERING WHEEL. THIS FAULTY CLOCKSPRING IS THE CULPRIT FOR POTENTIAL AIRBAG FAILURE IN THE 2010 JEEP WRANGLER (LHD) DURING AN ACCIDENT OR PREMATURE DEPLOYMENT WHEN SIMPLY DRIVING AROUND. DAIMLER CHRYSLER HAS REFUSED TO ADDRESS THE SAFETY CONCERN OF THEIR FAULTY CLOCKSPRING THAT CAN CAUSE FAILURE OF THE VEHICLE'S AIRBAGS FROM PROPERLY DEPLOYING."
CAR STALLED LOOSING ALL POWER AND DRIVABILITY DEALER CLAIMS THE ALTERNATOR WENT BAD AND FUSE ABLE LINK MELTED CAUSING ME TO NEED A WHOLE NEW WIRING SET
FUEL OVERFLOWS EVERY TIME I FILL UP. IF I FILL THE TANK TO THE AUTO SHUTOFF POINT A FAIR AMOUNT OF FUEL SPITS OUT AND DOWN THE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE. THIS IS A POTENTIAL FIRE HAZARD, AND NOT VERY GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. SO NOW I ONLY PUT THREE FOURTHS IN SO I DON'T HAVE IT POURING OUT AND ONTO MY JEEP
I HAVE A 2010 JEEP WRANGLER SAHARA UNLIMITED WITH 62K ON IT. I FIRST NOTICED A JAR AND SHAKING AFTER HITTING A BUMP A FEW MONTHS AGO AND DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING OF THIS, UNTIL TONIGHT!Y JEEP IS COMPLETELY STOCK. I WAS COMING HOME FROM WORK AND HIT A BUMP ON THE HIGHWAY AND MY WHOLE ENTIRE FRONT END COMPLETELY SHOOK WHERE I COULD BARELY CONTROL THE VEHICLE. I HAD TO SLOW DOWN BUT WAS SCARED TO DEATH BECAUSE THERE WAS A SEMI BEHIND ME, WHEN I SLOWED DOWN IT DIDN'T DO IT ANYMORE! THIS IS SO DANGEROUS I GO ON MULTIPLE TRIPS WITH MY TWO SONS AND CAN'T IMAGINE TO SAFETY THAT IS AT RISK WITH THIS TYPE OF MALFUNCTION IN A JEEP.   *TR
AT THE END OF ATTEMPTING TO FILL OUR GAS TANK, FUEL EXPELLED FROM THE TANK BACK OUT ONTO MY HUSBAND, THE SIDE OF THE CAR AND THE GROUND AROUND THE PORT.  THIS EXPERIENCE HAS REPEATED ITSELF AT DIFFERENT GAS STATIONS AND IN DIFFERENT OUTDOOR CONDITIONS (RAINY, SUNNY, SNOW, ETC.).  WE PREVIOUSLY OWNED A 2008 JEEP WRANGLER THAT DEMONSTRATED THE SAME ISSUE AND A REPAIR WAS MADE AS THAT MODEL YEAR WAS WITHIN A PREVIOUS RECALL RANGE.    BEFORE WE PURCHASE THIS VEHICLE (USED) WE CHECKED THE  MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR RECORDS AND KNEW THIS ISSUE HAD NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED.  SO, WE WERE SURPRISE TO EXPERIENCE IT.  WE WERE EVEN MORE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT CHRYSLER IS NOT GOING TO ASSUME THE RESPONSIBILITY TO REPAIR THIS KNOW DEFECT ISSUE FOR A LATER MODEL (WHY HASN'T THIS BEEN FIXED?) WITH LITTLE CONCERN FOR PERSONAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY FOR FAMILIES WHEN REPORTED.      ALL ATTEMPTS TO CONVERSE WITH CHRYSLER REPRESENTATIVES ABOUT THIS HAVE RESULTED IN A "IT'S YOUR PROBLEM" ATTITUDE - NO RECALL, NO WARRANTY AND WRONG MODEL YEAR - AND ABSOLUTELY PUSHING US TO TAKE IT UP WITH THE DEALER TO GET FIXED.  OUR DEALER IS AN HONEST, HARDWORKING BUSINESS AND WE KNOW IT'S NOT HIS ISSUE . . . IT'S CHRYSLER'S.  CHRYSLER NEEDS TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.    THIS IS MY PRIMARY MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION.  I DRIVE THREE SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN IN THIS CAR.  IT WAS TO BE THE CAR MY SOON-TO-BE LICENSED DRIVERS WERE TO HAVE.    *TR
WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, THE VEHICLE HEADLAMPS BLINKED ON AND OFF TWICE THEN WENT OUT.  I TRIED CYCLING THE SWITCH ON AND OFF BUT THEY WOULD NOT TURN ON.  SHORTLY AFTER SWITCHING TO HIGH BEAMS, THESE TOO TURNED OFF.  THIS HAS HAPPENED NUMEROUS TIMES SINCE 9/12/14.  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 JEEP WRANGLER.  THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING 45-60 MPH, THE FRONT END OF THE VEHICLE SHOOK VIOLENTLY CAUSING THE STEERING WHEEL TO BECOME DIFFICULT TO CONTROL. THE CONTACT MENTIONED THAT THE FAILURE WAS INTERMITTENT.  THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO A DEALER, WHO DIAGNOSED THAT THE TIRE ROD END AND THE STEERING DAMPER NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND THE TIRES NEEDED TO BE ROTATED. THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED BUT THE FAILURE RECURRED.  THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE.  THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 44,447.
I WAS FUELING THE VEHICLE AND THE FUEL JUST OVERFLOWS OUT OF THE TANK AS THOUGH THERE IS NO STOP. AFTER THE FUEL GUSHES OUT OF THE NECK OF THE GAS TANK. THE ISSUE WAS ONCE A RARE ISSUE BUT NOW OCCURS EVERY SINGLE TIME I FUEL THE VEHICLE. I FEAR THAT THIS MAY BE A FIRE HAZARD AND IT IS CERTAINLY A SAFETY ISSUE WITH FUEL EMERGING FROM THE TANK. IT FIRST OCCURRED IN 2010 WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS NEW BUT IT WAS RARE. THE ISSUE NOW HAPPENS BI-WEEKLY AND HAS HAPPENED WEEKLY SINCE 2011.  *TR
WHEN REFUELING, THE NOZZLE ON THE FUEL PUMP WILL NOT STOP ON TIME, ALLOWING FUEL TO SPLASH BACK AT THE PERSON REFUELING. TODAY, THE NOZZLE DIDN'T STOP AT ALL, ALLOWING A LOT OF FUEL TO SPILL ON THE GROUND. A PERSON DOESN'T HAVE TO FILL IT UP EITHER. IF YOU STOP MID REFILL, IT WILL STILL SPRAY BACK AT THE PERSON REFUELING.   *TR
2010 JEEP WRANGLER AIR BAG LIGHT  CAME ON  ALSO HORN AND CRUISE CONTROL IS NOT FUNCTIONING BECAUSE OF A BAD CLOCK SPRING. I HAVE BEEN READING ONLINE WHERE THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE.  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 JEEP WRANGLER. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 70 MPH, THE REAR PASSENGER'S SIDE TIRE BLEW AND CAUSED THE CONTACT TO LOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.  THE TIRE WAS REPLACED. THE FRONT DRIVER'S SIDE TIRE ALSO BLEW ON A LATER DATE. THE VEHICLE WAS INSPECTED BY AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC, WHO STATED THAT THE VALVE STEM NUTS WERE FRACTURED AND CAUSED THE FAILURE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 25,000.    *TR
I HAVE A 2010 JEEP WRANGLER RUBICON UNLIMITED AND THE AIR BAG WARNING LIGHT KEEPS GOING ON AND OFF.  AFTER READING ON THE WEB SEEMS A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS PROBLEM ON ALL MAKES OF JEEP WRANGLER JK MODELS.  *TR
EVERY TIME I FILL MY VEHICLE UP WITH GAS THE PUMP SHUTS OFF AND THEN THE VEHICLE SPEWS GAS OUT OF THE FILL TUBE. THIS HAS HAPPENED AT EVERY PUMP I HAVE USED AT MULTIPLE GAS STATIONS. I HAVE TRIED DIFFERENT ANGLES AND IT DOES NOT HELP. THE LAST TIME IT HAPPENED GAS GOT ALL OVER MY HANDS AND ALL OVER THE VEHICLE. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE PAINT WEARING AWAY AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUE OF HAVING GAS UNDER THE VEHICLE. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT COMES OUT OF THE FILL TUBE WHEN THIS HAPPENS. I HAVE SEEN MULTIPLE REPORTS OF THIS HAPPENING ON DIFFERENT FORUMS. IT LOOKS LIKE A WARRANTY WAS EXTENDED FOR 2007 AND 2008 MODELS, BUT NOT 2010'S.  *TR
WHILE FILLING MY 2010 JEEP WRANGLER UNLIMITED WITH FUEL IT SPIT BACK ON ME. THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME MULTIPLE TIMES.  *TR
MY 2010 JEEP WAS PARKED BUT RUNNING WHEN A FRIEND YELLED THAT MY CAR WAS ON FIRE SO I GOT OUT AND LOOKED AND FLAMES WERE SHOOTING OUT OF THE GRILL AND COMING OUT OF THE WHEEL WELL, WITHIN 2 MIN THE WHOLE JEEP WAS IN FLAMES AND WAS A TOTAL LOSS, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED BUT WAS TOO LATE, THE INSURANCE COMPANY SAID IT MOST LIKELY CAME FROM THE TRANSMISSION OR ENGINE AS THERE WAS PROBLEMS REPORTED LATELY.   *JS
GAS TANK OVERFILL ISSUE.  DURING FILL UPS THE PUMP WILL SHUT OFF AUTOMATICALLY AS INTENDED.  WITHIN SECONDS A QUANTITY OF GAS WILL SURGE FROM THE FILLER NECK AND LEAK DOWN THE SIDE.  THE QUANTITY IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT.  PER MY RECORDS FROM PREVIOUS FILL UPS (WHERE THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE) NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN QUANTITY OF GAS OR MILEAGE DRIVEN HAS OCCURRED.   ATTEMPTS TO LIMIT THE PROBLEM BY FILLING UP AT 1/2 TANK DID NOT HELP.  SLOWING THE FILL RATE DOES NOT HELP MOST OF THE TIME.  *TR
WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY, MY JEEP JUMPS OUT OF FIRST GEAR WHILE ACCELERATING AWAY FROM A STOP. EVEN WITH MY HAND ON THE SHIFT LEVER, HOLDING MY VEHICLE IN FIRST GEAR, IT WILL AT TIMES JUMP OUT OF GEAR WITH A VIOLENT METAL-ON-METAL COLLISION SOUND. SEVERAL TIMES THIS HAS HAPPENED WHEN CROSSING OR JOINING TRAFFIC AT AN INTERSECTION, AND IS VERY DANGEROUS.
TL*THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 JEEP WRANGLER LIMITED. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 45 MPH THE CONTACT SMELLED SMOKE IN THE VEHICLE, PULLED INTO A DRIVEWAY AND STEPPED OUT OF THE VEHICLE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT SMOKE WAS COMING FROM THE ENGINE AND CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.  A POLICE OFFICER ARRIVED BUT DID NOT FILE A REPORT. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ALSO DID NOT FILE A REPORT. THE VEHICLE WAS DESTROYED. SHE CALLED THE MANUFACTURER AND THEY PERFORMED AN INVESTIGATION AND DENIED THE CLAIM. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 3,000.
I PURCHASED A USED 2006 JEEP WRANGLER X (TJ) IN JULY 2010 AND THE FUEL TANK OVERFLOWS WHILE PUMPING GAS. *TR
GAS OVER FLOWS OUT FROM FILLER AND DOES NOT STOP. HAPPENS AT SEVERAL DIFFERENT GAS STATIONS WITH RATCHET ON AND SELF FILLING. *TR
The clutch. I was driving down the freeway and the clutch went out. Yes, Champion Jeep Dodge confirm the clutch system went out. Yes, I was told they do not cover the clutch. There was no one he signed symptoms or problems. I did take it back to AutoNation on 2 other occasion complaining about the brakes and the emergency.   I have had this vehicle less than 7 months and had nothing but problems.  I paid Auto Nation $6,500 for this Lemon vehicle & purchase the extend warranty plus, because I was told if anything breaks down with this vehicle, I would be covered bumper to bumper on this vehicle within the 2-year time period, under this extended warranty plus. Todd told me It would cover everything under the warranty and specifically the clutch, transmission, motor & electronics. My brother asked Todd several times precisely about the clutch and was told yes with the extended warranty plus, it covers everything major on this vehicle. With the Extended Warranties Plus, You ARE COVERED BUMPER to BUMPER, this is the most comprehensive coverage.  NOW, I am asking you to put me in another vehicle until you get this figured out. I am requesting Auto Nation to get me in another vehicle, because I believe this is a LEMON vehicle and I am tired of all the problems with this truck. If you can assure me that Y'all is going to handle this ongoing problem with my Jeep. This Jeep was at Delta World Tire June 13 – 19 and then I transferred to Champion Chrysler Dodge Jeep on the 19th of June waiting for approval. Auto Nation extended warranty denied claim on vehicle (Denial Reason for the Case [XXX]).  Delta World tire was the Preferred shop but was behind in workload and short on mechanics. So, I had to tow it to Champion Jeep Dodge. So please let me know how much longer it is going to take to decide what you all going to do about the LEMON vehicle you sold me and when to come over to Mobile and pick up another vehicle. I Anticipate and answer immediately! I have a letter I wrote INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
I have been experiencing the "death Wobble" for many years, and have gone to various shops to find out the problem but have not been able to fix the "death wobble".  The entire car shakes and vibrates uncontrollably when I drive on the free way over a bump, or even when I drive on a regular street and hit a bump. The shaking doesn't stop until I come to a complete stop, and that is very dangerous on the freeway. Once the "death wobble" is going on braking and controlling the jeep are nearly impossible.  I have recently found out about a class action lawsuit for this very problem, and I believe my car qualifies to be part of this.  I have not been able to document this because it doesn't always happen, and when it does I don't have a camera running.
FIRST MY HORN STOPPED WORKING THEN THE BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL QUIT WORKING THEN THE RADIO STARTED GETTING ALL STATIC BUT AT FIRST WHEN RADIO STARTED BEING STATIC THE CD PLAYER STILL WORKED AND THEN THE CD PLAYER WOULD PLAY INTERMITTENLY AND NOT A SOUND IN RADIO MODE NOW NOW CD , NO RADIO, NO STEERING WHEEL BUTTON AND NO HORN. THE CRUISE CONTROL LIGHT COMES ON IF THE BUTTON IS PRESSED BUT THAT IS IT. IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A WORKING HORN SAFETY!!! I WAS TOLD IT IS THE CLOCKSPRING GOING OUT AND CAUSING ALL THESE ISSUES AND CAUSEING THE AMPLIFIER TO FAIL AND THE STEREO MALFUNCTION AND NEEDING TO BE REPLACED. COSTING A COUPLE THOUSAND DOLLARS.
DRIVING TO WORK MY WRANGLER DIED AND BURST INTO FLAMES MOVING FROM THE BACK TO THE FRONT. I WAS NORTHBOUND ON HWY 265 WHEN VEHICLE DIED AND STARTED BURNING.*DT*JB
TL* TAKATA RECALL. THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 JEEP WRANGLER. THE CONTACT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 19V018000 (AIR BAGS). THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE MANUFACTURER EXCEEDED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THE RECALL REPAIR. GLENN'S FREEDOM CHRYSLER DODGE JEEP RAM (1560 E NEW CIRCLE RD, LEXINGTON, KY 40509, (888) 365-3286) WAS CONTACTED AND CONFIRMED THAT THE PARTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE RECALL REMEDY. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND DID NOT ASSIST. THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE. THE VIN WAS INVALID.
AIR BAG LIGHTS KEEP TURNING OFF AND ON.
I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD GOING 55 MPH AND A HUGE GUST OF WHITE SMOKE CAME THRU THE DASH VENT SYSTEM SO I PULLED OVER AND GOT OUT OF MY JEEP SAHARA AND NOTICED A BIG MASS OF WHITE SMOKE COMING OUT FROM UNDER THE HOOD... 2 MINUTES LATER, FIRE STARTED AND WITHIN A COUPLE MINUTES MY WHOLE FRONT PART OF THE JEEPS ENGINE WAS ENGULFED IN FLAMES.  THAN FROM THERE IT BURNED UP THE REST OF THE JEEP.. THIS VEHICLE WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED IN A MATTER OF 10-15 MINUTES..  I WAS DRIVING ON A PAVED ROAD IN THE COUNTRY ..
WHEN FILLING THE GAS TANK THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE FILET NECK. THE GAS DOES NOT STOP WHEN YOUR FILLING IT. THE GAS OVERRATED ALL THE TIME. THE PERSON AT THE GAS STATION SAYS IT HAPPENS W ALL THE JEEP'S. THIS IS DANGEROUS AND SOMEONE IS GOING TO DIE WHEN THE GAS SPILLS OUT. ALSO JEEP SAYS IT'S A PROBLEM BUT SAYS THERE ISN'T A RECALL
FRONT END: I REPLACED TRACK BAR AND STEERING DAMPER AT 27,221 MILES ON THE VEHICLE. BAR BENT UNDER NORMAL DRIVING AND ROAD CONDITIONS WHICH IS UPON PAVED ROADS. THIS CAR DOESN'T GO OFF ROAD AND I REPLACED A PART THAT SHOULD LAST FOR WELL OVER THIS SHORT MILEAGE LIFE. IN THE SERVICE END OF THE BUSINESS (AT THE JEEP DEALER) THIS WAS CALLED "THE TIRE DEATH ROLL" FOR WHEN THIS HAPPENS ALL MANOR OF VEHICLE CONTROL IS MINIMAL. I EXPERIENCED THIS 3 TIMES UPON MY DRIVE OUT OF TOWN FOR A TRIP AS I WAS AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND THIS WOULD HAPPEN AS I MADE CONNECTIONS FROM ONE FREEWAY SYSTEM TO ANOTHER. I TOOK THE CAR IN TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS WRONG SO IT COULD BE FIXED AND THEN FINISHED MY TRIP. I HAVE REPORTED THIS TO THE FIAT CHRYSLER GROUP TO REIMBURSE ME FOR THE COSTS ASSOCIATED FOR FIXING AN INFERIOR PART. THERE RESPONSE WAS SINCE I DIDN'T PURCHASE AN "EXTENDED VEHICLE WARRANTY: IT'S NOT THEIR PROBLEM. I HAVE GONE OUT TO GOOGLE "TIRE DEATH ROLL" ON JEEPS AND IT SEEMS PRETTY COMMON, WHICH SEEMS PRETTY NEGLIGENT ON THEIR END. IF IT'S A "KNOW ISSUE", THEN WHEN CAR COME IN FOR SERVICE OR RECALLS THEY SHOULD LOOK AT THE "BAR AND DAMPER" SINCE IT SEEMS TO DIE PRETTY QUICKLY IN JEEPS AND NEED TO BE REPLACED COMMONLY. THIS REMINDS ME OF THE EXPLORER AND IT "ISSUES FOR MANY YEARS". I TOLD THE FIAT CASE WORKER" THAT THE CAR ONLY HAS 27,221 MILES ON IT. YES THE CAR IS 6 YEARS OLD BUT RARELY DRIVEN, AND FRONT END STEERING PARTS SHOULD LAST LONGER THAN WHAT I EXPERIENCED, EXTENDED WARRANTY OR NOT. NO ONE WANT TO EXPERIENCE LOSS OF VEHICLE CONTROL ON A HIGHWAY RAMP AT 50 OR 60 MILES AND HOUR ON A SMOOTH CURVE IN THE ROAD. THIS "TIRE DEATH ROLL" EXPERIENCE HAPPENS WHEN THE CAR IS BEING DRIVEN ON A HIGHWAY IN MY INSTANCE, NOT WHEN ONE TURNS AT INTERSECTION LIGHTS.
ON MY 2011 JEEP WRANGLER UNLIMITED DASHBOARD, THE AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT FLASHES ON EVERY OTHER MINUTE WITH A CHIME WHILE DRIVING. THIS IS AN INDICATION THAT THERE IS SOMETHING MALFUNCTIONING OR INTERFERING WITH THE VEHICLE'S AIRBAGS. THIS APPEARS TO BE A RECURRING SITUATION, BASED ON RESEARCH IN JEEP FORUMS, AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO BE CAUSED BY A FAULTY CLOCKSPRING WITHIN THE VEHICLE'S STEERING WHEEL.  *TR

THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE MANUFACTURER EXCEEDED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THE RECALL REPAIR. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE AIR BAG WARNING LIGHT WAS ILLUMINATED. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 70,000. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. VIN TOOL CONFIRMS REMEDY NOT YET AVAILABLE.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 JEEP WRANGLER. WHILE TURNING THE VEHICLE, THE TIRES SEIZED AND CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO STOP INDEPENDENTLY. IN ADDITION, THE VEHICLE MADE AN ABNORMAL NOISE ONCE SHIFTED INTO DRIVE. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO A DEALER WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE TRANSMISSION NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 63,000.
THE DEALER HAVE FAILURE TO REMEDY THIS DEFECT.
PURCHASED THE VECHICLE NEW, WITHIN 2500 MILES VECHICLE LEAKED WITH OVER 1INCH OF WATER ON THE PASSENGER SIDE FLOOR BOARD, THE DEALER REPLACED THE SEALS MOVE FORWARD 40K MILES DRIVE SIDE DOES THE SAME, REPLACED THE SEALS. AS SOON AS THE SEALS HAVE WERE REPLACED THE PASSENGER SIDE AND THE CENTER SEAM OF THE FREEDOM PANEL STARTED LEAKING. MY VECHICLE HAS MOOD AND MILD ALL OVER THE INSIDE OF THE ROOF AND UNDER THE SEATS. WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT THE VERY FIRST FIX WAS AN OBSOLETE FIX AND THEY HAVE COME OUT WITH A BETTER SEAL KIT BUT IT WOULD BE AT MY COST TO REPLACE. MY VECHICLE IS NOW JUST OVER 70K MILES AND HAS NEVER BEEN DRY SINCE WE BOUGHT IT NEW. NOT TO MENTION I'VE GONE THROUGH THREE STEREOS DUE TO THE LEAK AND SHORTING OUT AS WELL.
ON MY 2011 JEEP WRANGLER RUBICON UNLIMITED (LHD) DASHBOARD, THE AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT FLASHES ON EVERY OTHER MINUTE WITH A CHIME, AN INDICATION THAT THERE IS SOMETHING MALFUNCTIONING OR INTERFERING WITH THE VEHICLE'S AIRBAGS.THIS HAS BEEN A RECURRING ISSUE AND CONCERN FOR MANY 2007 AND NEWER JEEP WRANGLER (LHD) OWNERS, INCLUDING MYSELF, AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO BE CAUSED BY A FAULTY CLOCKSPRING WITHIN THE VEHICLE'S STEERING WHEEL. THIS FAULTY CLOCKSPRING IS THE CULPRIT FOR POTENTIAL AIRBAG FAILURE IN THE JEEP WRANGLER (LHD) DURING AN ACCIDENT OR PREMATURE DEPLOYMENT WHEN SIMPLY DRIVING AROUND. DAIMLER CHRYSLER HAS REFUSED TO ADDRESS THE SAFETY CONCERN OF THEIR FAULTY CLOCKSPRING THAT CAN CAUSE FAILURE OF THE VEHICLE'S AIRBAGS FROM PROPERLY DEPLOYING.
THE FRONT TWO DOORS OF MY JEEP LEAK WATER. IF IT RAINS OVER NIGHT THE PASSENGER FLOOR BOARD WILL HAVE 3/4 INCH OF STANDING WATER, THE DOOR LEAKS MORE WHEN DRIVING WHILE RAINING. THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR LEAKS, BUT ONLY WHEN DRIVING AND NOT ENOUGH TO FILL THE FLOOR BOARD. I SHOP VACUUM THE PASSENGER FLOOR BOARD EVERY TIME IT RAINS TO GET THE STANDING WATER OUT, THEN PUT TOWELS DOWN TO SOAK UP WHAT IS LEFT. THE CARPET NOW SMELLS MOLDY, THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE CONCERNING MY HEALTH. JEEP HAS A SERVICE BULLETIN OF 23-010-13 (FORMALLY 23-001-12) OUT, SO THEY KNOW ABOUT THE ISSUE. WHY CAN THEY NOT DO A RECALL ON THE ISSUE?  *TR
TRAVELING ABOUT 50 MPH IN SWEEPING LEFT TURN ON SMOOTH, PAVED ROAD, VEHICLE BEGAN TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY, DID NOT WANT TO RESPOND TO HARD BRAKING AND CONTINUED UNTIL UNDER 25 MPH.  TIRES WERE CLOSE TO BEING WORN OUT, THEY WERE REPLACED WITH NEW ALIGNMENT.  PROBLEM HAS CONTINUED WITH NEW TIRES.  JEEP WAS AT DEALERSHIP 3 DAYS AND THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG, I WANT TO ADD THEY WERE CONCERNED AND VERY NICE BUT FOUND NO PROBLEM.  DRIVING HOME FROM DEALERSHIP IT HAPPENED 3 TIMES AND HAS HAPPENED NUMEROUS TIMES SINCE.  DEALERSHIP SUGGESTED NEW TIRES WERE BAD, BUT THIS HAS NOW HAPPENED ON 2 SETS OF TIRES.  THE PROBLEM OCCURS WITH SUCH VIOLENCE IT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVER, PASSENGER, AND OTHER VEHICLES SHARING THE ROAD.  THIS ALSO HAPPENS ON ROADS WITH BUMPS ON STRAIGHTWAY SUCH AS MIGHT BE FOUND IN RIGHT LANE WHERE HEAVY TRUCKS CAUSE SURFACE DEFORMATIES.  OUR JEEP HAS NO MODIFICATIONS TO ANY PART, STEERING, SUSPENSION, SHOCKS, OR HAS TIRES NOT RECOMMENDED FOR THIS VEHICLE.  *TR
WHENEVER I GO TO THE GAS STATION TO FILL UP WITH GAS, ONE OF TWO THINGS HAPPENS; EITHER IT DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY CUTOFF AND GAS SPILLS OUT ONTO MY FENDER/WHEEL, OR IT DOES THE OPPOSITE....CONTINUES TO CLICK OFF OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND I AM UNABLE TO FILL MY TANK. I HAVE TRIED GETTING GAS AT SEVERAL DIFFERENT STATIONS NOW, AND IT DOES IT AT ALL OF THEM.  *TR
MY GAS TANK OVERFLOWS AT THE PUMP EVERY TIME I RE-FUEL. THE PUMP WILL SHUT OFF WHEN FULL, THEN SHORTLY AFTER, OVERFLOW SPILLS OUT ONTO THE GROUND. THE ONLY WAY TO PREVENT THIS ISSUE IS TO GUESS WHEN IT IS GETTING CLOSE TO FULL AND STOP THE PUMP BEFORE IT IS FULL.   *JS
WHILE DRIVING UNDER 30 MPH ON ASPHALT, DASH DISPLAY INDICATED "HOT OIL" WITH AN AUDIBLE DING. PLACED IN PARK AND ALLOWED THE TRANSMISSION TO COOL DOWN. FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED TO MY JEEP, HOWEVER AFTER RESEARCH THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE DUE TO THE TRANSMISSION COOLER NOT DOING ITS JOB. CAN RESULT IN EQUIPMENT FAILURE OR FIRE. JEEP CORRECTS ISSUE AFTER A FAILURE, HOWEVER IF YOU WAIT FOR FAILURE THEN YOU RISK FIRE. WITH 2 CHILDREN AND MY WIFE IN THE JEEP, THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED NOW FOR SAFETY.  *TR
DEAR[XXX]    A VERY HIGH PROFILE ACCIDENT OCCURRED IN THE CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE AREA ON APRIL 30, 2011.  ON THAT DATE A [XXX] DROVE OFF A CLIFF ON SIGNAL MOUNTAIN AND WENT MISSING FOR 7 MONTHS...    T-3.4 SECS, THE YAW RATE SENSOR SHOWED A SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE YAW RATE FROM -23 DEGREES/SECOND TO 0 DEGREES/SECOND IN 0.2 SECS.     T-2.9 SECS, THE VEHICLE DETECTS THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE YAW RATE AND CAUSES THE ESP TRACTION LAMP TO START FLASHING. THE LAMP REMAINS FLASHING UP UNTIL THE IMPACT WITH A 300# BOULDER AT WHICH TIME THE AIRBAGS DEPLOYED RECORDING THESE DATA.    T-2.5 SECS, THE DRIVER NOTICES THE FLASHING ESP TRACTION LAMP IN 0.4 SECS LIFTING HER FOOT OFF THE ACCELERATOR BRIEFLY FOR 0.3 SECONDS. THE ACCELERATOR POSITION IS INDICATED BY THE BLUE LINE. SHE THEN REAPPLIED THE ACCELERATOR TO THE SAME LOCATION BY T-2.2 SECS INDICATING THAT SHE REALIZED SHE WAS NOT SLIDING DESPITE THE ESP TRACTION INDICATOR. SHE HAD HER VEHICLE UNDER CONTROL AT THIS TIME.    T-1.8 SECS, THE ESP MODULE APPARENTLY TOLD THE ELECTRONIC STABILITY PUMP TO LOCK BOTH FRONT WHEELS WHILE ALLOWING BOTH BACK WHEELS TO KEEP DRIVING THE VEHICLE FORWARD. THIS SUGGESTS THAT IN ADDITION TO HER YAW SENSOR FAILURE THERE WAS ALSO A SOFTWARE ERROR THAT TOOK PLACE. (I KNOW OF NO CIRCUMSTANCE WHEN ONE WOULD WANT BOTH FRONT WHEELS TO LOCK IN ORDER TO STABILIZE A VEHICLE IN MOTION). THE LOCKING OF BOTH FRONT WHEELS THEN CAUSED HER TO LOSE CONTROL ULTIMATELY PLUNGING HER OFF THE 300 FOOT CLIFF.     T-0.5 SECS, ALTHOUGH THE DRIVER IS STILL 0.5 SEC FROM THE AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT THE YAW RATE SENSOR LOST COMMUNICATION WITH THE AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT RECORDER CONFIRMING THAT HER YAW RATE SENSOR HAD FAILED, I.E.

DEFECT: FAILURE OF THE FACTORY INSTALLED MOPAR/CHROME BUMPER IN AN IMPACT OF LESS THAN 5 MILES PER HOUR.   2011 JEEP WRANGLER WAS INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT WHEREIN THE  FRONT RIGHT BUMPER IMPACTED INTO A FIXED OBJECT (FREE STANDING BRICK WALL). THE BUMPER, WHICH CONSISTS OF TWO CHROME WRAPPED TUBULAR DEVICES MOUNTED TO A CENTER HOLDING BRACKET, SUFFERED NEGLIBLE DAMAGE CONSISTING OF SHALLOW ABRATIONS ON THE TUBULAR DEVICE AND WITHOUT EVIDENCE OF DENTING OF SAID DEVICE. THE TUBULAR COMPONENT MOUNTS TO THE HOLDING BRACKET BY WAY OF BOLTS. THE MOUNTING BRACKET SHOWS NO SIGN OF DAMAGE HOWEVER THE TUBULAR COMPONENTS NOW MOVE FREELY BUT REMAIN MOUNTED TO THE BRACKET INDICATIVE OF DAMAGE TO THE HOLDING BOLTS OR THE INTERNAL NUT/SCREW SYSTEM INSIDE THE TUBULAR COMPONENTS. THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED IN A CONFINED SPACE OF A DRIVEWAY. THE LOCAL DEALER WAS CONTACTED AND EXAMINED THE BUMPER. THE LOCAL DEALER DID NOT BELIEVE THE BUMPER WAS DESIGNED TO BE "BREAK AWAY " IN A LOW SPEED/LESS THAN 5 MILE PER HR ACCIDENT. THE DEALER WAS ASKED TO CONTACT THE MANUFACTURE OF THE BUMPER TO DISCUSS THIS DEFECTIVE PART OR DESIGN FLAW.  *TR
The contact owns a 2012 Jeep Wrangler. The contact stated that while operating the vehicle the ABS, Traction Control and check engine warning lights had remained illuminated. The contact indicated that while pressing the brake pedal to stop, the brake pedal extended to the floor causing the braking distance to become extended. The vehicle was taken to the local dealer who diagnosed that the ABS module was faulty and needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not yet repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure but no assistance was offered. The failure mileage was 55,000.
I noticed that the air bag light came in about 6-12 months ago.  I am very concerned because, my Jeep is in excellent shape, however, I transport my 94 yo mom around, so this really bothers me.  I have seen several recalls regarding air bags in my model, so I wanted to see if this would be part of one of the recalls.  I had my mechanic review and to replace would cost me about $800, which I do not have.  If this is due to a failure on Jeeps part, I would like this taken care of.
I was driving on the highway and the engine caught fire. I’ve been looking for an engine to rebuild and all of them had previously been on fire. I believe the engine is defective for the jeeps that year, make and model.
I RECENTLY PURCHASED A 2012 JEEP WRANGLER UNLIMITED (VIN: [XXX]).  WITHIN 1 MONTH OF TAKING POSSESSION OF THE VEHICLE, THE CAR BEGAN TO STALL INTERMITTENTLY WHILE DRIVING.  SPECIFICALLY, THE ENGINE SHUTS OFF AND THE POWER STEERING AND BREAKS DEACTIVATE.  TO STATE THE OBVIOUS, THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS CONDITION, PARTICULARLY AS OUR FAMILY HAS THREE CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF SIX.  TO DATE, LARRY MILLER JEEP HAS BEEN UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE ISSUE AS NO ERROR CODES APPEAR.      LOOKING ONLINE, THIS APPEARS TO BE A KNOWN DEFECT WITH JEEPS OF MY MODEL YEAR (HTTPS://WWW.WRANGLERFORUM.COM/THREADS/ELECTRICAL-PROBLEM-SHUTS-OFF-WHILE-DRIVING.190041/) SO I AM SURPRISED THAT JEEP HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL RELATED TO THIS PROBLEM GIVEN THE DIRE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES.      I HAVE ESCALATED THIS MATTER TO YOUR CUSTOMER CARE GROUP, BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE FCA HAS SITUATIONAL AWARENESS OF THIS SITUATION AS WELL.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR
MY 2012 JEEP WRANGLER SAHARA UNLIMITED 6 SPEED MANUAL TRANSMISSION SUDDENLY STARTED VIOLENTLY POPPING OUT OF FIRST GEAR. IT IS VERY RANDOM AND UNPREDICTABLE MAKING IT EVEN MORE DANGEROUS. I COULD BE PULLING OUT INTO A BUSY INTERSECTION, TAKING OFF FROM A STOP SIGN/ LIGHT OR PULLING OUT FROM A PARKING SPACE INTO TRAFFIC AND MY SHIFTER WILL SUDDENLY JUMP OUT OF FIRST GEAR INTO NEUTRAL, CAUSING THE CAR TO LOSE ALL POWER. THERE IS A LOUD SOUND AND A FEELING OF SCRAPING LIKE THE GEARS ARE BEING STRIPPED. THE STEERING ALSO GETS VERY SHAKY EVEN AT LOW SPEEDS (APPROX 40 MPH) IN THE SAME WAY IT WOULD AT A HIGH SPEED WHEN IN NEED OF A HIGH SPEED BALANCE. THIS IS MY 3RD JEEP WRANGLER, ALL OF WHICH HAVE HAD MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS (A 1989, 2004 AND THIS 2012). I'VE DRIVEN MANUAL TRANSMISSION VEHICLES AND SPORTBIKES SINCE 1989 FROM TOYOTAS AND HONDAS TO VOLKSWAGENS TO SUZUKIS AND YAMAHAS AND I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THIS, NEVER EVEN BURNED OUT A CLUTCH, SO I CAN RULE OUT DRIVER ERROR. I PURCHASED THIS 2012 BRAND NEW AND HAD IT BUILD TO MY SPECIFICATIONS BECAUSE THERE WERE NO MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS AVAILABLE IN THE DEALER INVENTORY. I HAVE FOUND THAT 1000S OF OTHER JEEP OWNERS WITH MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS HAVE HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE, NARROWLY ESCAPING SERIOUS COLLISIONS WHEN THE CARS JUMP OUT OF GEAR AND LOSE POWER. JEEP LOVERS ARE LOYAL AND SUPPORT THE BRAND. IT WOULD BE NICE IF CHRYSLER WOULD BE LOYAL TO ITS CUSTOMERS AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE FLAWS IN THEIR MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS, RECALL THE OLD ONES AND CHANGE THE DESIGN OF THE NEW ONES BEFORE SOMEONE GETS SERIOUSLY HURT OR KILLED.
EMERGENCY BRAKE WILL NOT HOLD EVEN AFTER ADJUSTMENT. I'VE INSTALLED NEW REAR BRAKE ROTORS AND NEW EMERGENCY BRAKE SHOES. ADJUSTED THE ADJUSTER CORRECTLY AND STILL THE EMERGENCY BRAKE WILL NOT HOLD. DESIGN FLAW IN THE EMERGENCY BRAKE HANDLE PREVENTS IT FROM ENGAGING CORRECTLY. WEAK SPRING NOT DIRECT CABLE ATTACHMENT. NEVER HOLDS AT ALL.
FIRST MY POWER WINDOWS WOULDN'T WORK WHILE DRIVING,  I PULLED OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND TURNED THE CAR OFF AND THAT TEMPORARILY FIXED THE ISSUE (IT HAS HAPPEN TWICE SINCE).  THAT SAME DAY I WAS DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE USING MY CRUISE CONTROL SET AT 70MPH AND THE TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT CAME ON AND THE CRUISE CONTROL SHUT DOWN AND DISABLED ITSELF WHILE KEEPING THE CRUISE CONTROL LIGHT ON AND NOT ALLOWING ME TO TURN OFF OR RESET THE CRUISE CONTROL. (THESE LIGHTS WENT OUT THE FOLLOWING DAY).  A COUPLE DAYS LATER WHILE DRIVING, A WARNING OF THE REAR DRIVERS SIDE TURN SIGNAL BEING OUT CAME ON (THIS COMES AND GOES NOW ALMOST DAILY).  LAST NIGHT WHILE MY JEEP WAS PARKED IN DRIVEWAY OF MY HOME THE HEADLIGHTS AND DOME LIGHT STARTED COMING ON RANDOMLY.  THE HEADLIGHT AND DOME LIGHT SWITCH WHERE BOTH IN THE OFF POSITION AND THE KEYS WERE ON MY KITCHEN TABLE INSIDE THE HOUSE (THIS IS CONTINUING TO HAPPEN IN THE PARKING LOT AT WORK ALSO).  WHEN I GOT IN IT TO GO TO WORK AND WHILE IDLING THE HAZARDS LIGHTS WOULD RANDOMLY BLINK TWICE AND THEN STOP, WAIT A COUPLE MINUTES AND HAPPEN AGAIN.  WHILE SITTING IN THE PARKING LOT AT WORK I NOTICED THAT WHEN THIS HAPPEN THE HEADLIGHTS ARE ALSO TURNING ON, THEY TURNED OFF AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO, AND THEN IT HAPPENS AGAIN.  IT IS A RAINY DAY BUT BRIGHT ENOUGH THAT I COULD NOT TELL IF THE LIGHTS WERE RANDOMLY GOING IN AND OUT WHILE DRIVING.  REGARDLESS THIS IS TURNING IN TO A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND IT SEEMS TO BE ALL TOO COMMON WITH THESE FIAT-CHRYSLER VEHICLES.
HOOD FLUTTERS AT SPEEDS OVER 30MPH. CONCERNED THE HOOD WOULD FLY UP.
LEFT SIDE OF CYLINDER HEAD TICKING NOISE.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 JEEP WRANGLER. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 10 MPH AND MAKING A LEFT TURN, THE STEERING SEIZED AND THE VEHICLE STALLED. THE CONTACT WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE VEHICLE; HOWEVER, THE VEHICLE STALLED ONCE AGAIN. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO LEE'S SUMMIT DODGE CHRYSLER JEEP RAM (1051 SE OLDHAM PKWY, LEE'S SUMMIT, MO 64081, (816) 525-9825) WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE MAIN BODY WIRING HARNESS WAS WRAPPED AROUND THE STEERING COLUMN, WHICH CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO STALL WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL WAS TURNED TO THE LEFT. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 109,000.
THE HEATER ON MY JEEP, WHICH ONLY HAS 41,000 MILES ON IT, SLOWLY STOPPED WORKING.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER TO HAVE THEM CHECK IT OUT.  THE CALLED LATER THAT DAY AND SAID I NEED A NEW HEATER CORE WHICH COSTS $1200.  THE NEXT DAY THE CALLED BACK AND SAID THAT I ACTUALLY NEED A NEW HEATER CORE, RADIATOR, THERMOSTAT, ETC.  BASICALLY THE WHOLE HEATING/COOLING SYSTEM FOR THE ENGINE AND THE ESTIMATE IS UP TO $2200.  I LOOKED ONLINE AND FOUND THAT THIS IS NOT A NEW PROBLEM WHICH IS FRUSTRATING.  IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS A RADIATOR PROBLEM THAT SENDS PARTICLES THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND CLOGS THE HEATER CORE.  I'M HOPING THAT THERE WILL BE A RECALL SO THAT I CAN RECOUP SOME OF THIS $2200 THAT I'M ABOUT TO HAVE TO PAY TO FIX MY JEEP.  ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT APPARENTLY!
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 JEEP WRANGLER. WHILE DRIVING AT ANY SPEED PERIODICALLY, THE AIR BAG WARNING INDICATOR ILLUMINATED. THE FAILURE RECURRED. THE DEALER WAS CONTACTED (SHEETS CHRYSLER DODGE JEEP, 250 AUTO DR, BECKLEY, WV, 25801, 304-252-4555). THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 100,000.
JEEP HAD RANDOM "JOLT" WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AT SPEED.  THEN A REALLY HARD JOLT IN FEBRUARY THAT STALLED THE ENGINE WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE INTERSTATE AT 60 MPH.  WOULD NOT START FOR 10 MINUTES, THEN DID.  I HAVE TAKEN TO TWO DIFFERENT DEALERS WHO SAY THAT THEY CAN'T REPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  NOT SAFE AND THEY SHOULD HAVE TO FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEM AND FIX IT.
THE VEHICLE POWER ABRUPTLY DROPS WHILE DRIVING LOSING ANYWHERE FROM 100 TO 500 RPMS. IF THE VEHICLE IS STOPPED AT A SIGNAL OR TRAVELING AT LOWER SPEEDS THE POWER DROP WILL SHUT DOWN THE VEHICLE. THE PROBLEM IS RANDOM AND VERY UNSAFE
TIPM WENT OUT LOST ALL CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE WHILE TRAVELING 55 MPH! COULD HAVE BE A DEADLY SITUATION! JEEP NEEDS TO HAVE A RECALL ASAP....
VEHICLE CAUGHT FIRE WHILE I WAS DRIVING AND LOST ALL POWER.   ENGINE SHUT OFF AND THERE WAS LITTLE ABILITY TO STEER.  AS SOON AS I PULLED OVER SMOKE STARTED TO COME OUT FROM THE SIDES OF THE HOOD. WHEN I OPENED THE HOOD, THERE WERE FLAMES COMING FROM THE ENGINE NEAR THE FIREWALL.  LUCKILY A POLICE OFFICER HAPPENED TO BE DRIVING BY.  HE QUICKLY PUT OUT THE FIRE USING AN EXTINGUISHER FROM HIS PATROL CAR; HAD HE NOT BEEN THERE THE CAR WOULD HAVE QUICKLY BEEN CONSUMED.  THIS HAPPENED A FEW DAYS AGO.  SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH AND I HAVE BECOME AWARE THAT THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH WRANGLERS FOR MANY YEARS NOW.  IT'S DISAPPOINTING THAT CHRYSLER HAS NOT FIGURED OUT WHAT CAUSES THESE FIRES; HAD THIS HAPPENED WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY THE LACK OF STEERING ABILITY COULD HAVE EASILY RESULTED IN THE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH OF NOT JUST ME BUT OTHER DRIVERS AS WELL.

PURCHASE DATE JEEP 7/2014  EAST HILLS CHRYSLER EAST HILLS NY. UPON DRIVING THE VEHICLE HOME. I NOTICED IT HAD THE REAR SEAT BELT RIPPED OUT, PARKING BRAKE WAS DEFECTIVE AND A NAIL IN RIGHT PASSENGER SIDE TIRE. I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE BACK  AND STATED "HOW WAS VEHICLE PAST A SAFETY INSPECTION"? THEIR WAS RESPONSE WAS THE "SORRY".THE CAR WAS ADVERTISED A PRE-CERTIFIED BASED ON THE A 100 POINT INSPECTION, WHICH IT NEVER HAD. THEY REPLACED THE SEAT BELT THAT NIGHT.   5/4/2015, DRIVING HOME THE REAL DIFFERENTIAL FAILED (MILES 48806) BOTH FRONT AND REAR WERE LEAKING. I WAS DRIVING AT RATE  50 MPH. THE CHAIN OF EVENTS OF THE FAILURE AFFECTED THE FLANGE AND YOLK OFF THE DRIVE SHAFT. I TOOK IT BACK TO EAST HILLS CHRYSLER. THE POWER TRAIN WARRANTY COVERED THIS REPAIR HOWEVER, DURING THE FAILURE, I COULD NOT SHIFT TO SLOW THE VEHICLE, I HAD A LOT OF VIBRATION IN ON THE MANUAL STICK. I EXPRESSIVELY ASKED THE DEALER TO INSPECT THE CLUTCH, GEAR BOX AND TRANSMISSION FOR DAMAGE AS A RESULT FROM THE OF THE DIFFERENTIAL FAILURE. THEY SAID THEY WOULD. THE CAR WAS AT THE DEALER SHIP FOR 2 WEEKS. DROVE THE CAR HOME AND HEARD THIS WHINING SOUND FROM THE CLUTCH, BROUGHT IT BACK THE SAME DAY AND EXPLAINED TO THEM WHAT THE ISSUE WAS. THE NOISE WAS AND IS THE THROUGH OUT BEARING.  APPOINTMENT DATE 6/2/2015. THE CAR WAS THERE FOR 2 WEEKS. RESULT, THE TECH SAID THE NOISE WAS NORMAL. THE CLUTCH WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY, AND THE COULD NO GUARANTEE, THE NOISE WOULD GO AWAY.    AGAIN I EXPLAINED IT THE CLUTCH DAMAGE WAS AS A RESULT OF THE DIFFERENTIAL FAILING. DEALER SHIP STATED THAT THE CLUTCH WAS FINE NEXT APPOINTMENT 7/17/2015 - DEALER STATES THAT THE NOISE IN THE THROUGH OUT BEARING OF I TOLD EXPRESSED TO THEM. MY CONCERN ASIDE FROM THE REPAIR COST IS THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE WHO PLACE THEIR TRUST IN EXPERTS TO FIX AND MAINTAIN THE VEHICLES THAT BEING SOLD AND MISREPRESENTED AS SAFE.
ON OR ABOUT THE 10TH OF MARCH 2015 I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO THE DEALER BECAUSE THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  THE DEALER TURNED THE LIGHT OFF AND I MADE APT FOR A SEPARATE PROBLEM WHICH WAS A RECALL NOTICE.  THE DEALER SAID THEY WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE ENGINE LIGHT PROBLEM WHEN I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE BACK FOR THE RECALL.  WHEN I TOOK IT BACK THE DEALER SAID THE VEHICLE IS NOW OUT OF WARRANTY AS OF THE 14TH OF MARCH.  I ADVISED I UNDERSTAND THE DATE HOWEVER I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN AND YOU TURNED THE LIGHT OFF NOW YOU ARE TELLING ME I HAVE TO PAY 180.00 TO CHECK THE PROBLEM BECAUSE WARRANTY IS OVER.  TURNS OUT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE LEFT HEAD OF THE ENGINE AND THE #4 CYLINDER IS EXPERIENCING A MISFIRE.  I CALLED THE DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT THE JEEP, IT IS 400 MILES AWAY, I MOVED SINCE THE PURCHASE, THEY ADVISE THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE ENGINE, THEY DESCRIBE IT AND SAID IT WOULD BE A WARRANTY ITEM WHICH IS COVERED FOR 6 YEARS.  I CAN NOT DRIVE THE VEHICLE 400 MILES TO HAVE THE REPAIRS DONE AND I NEED HELP WITH GETTING SAHARA CHRYSLER JEEP DODGE IN LAS VEGAS TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM.  THE PROBLEM IS (X56) 3.6 LEFT CYLINDER HEAD.  *TR

LAST MONTH I WAS TOLD I WAS NUMBER 76 ON THE WAIT LIST - IF THEY GET ONE PART PER WEEK, I WILL GET MY PART IN OCTOBER 2015, MORE THAN TWO YEARS AFTER THE RECALL NOTICE WAS ISSUED.

Odometer Fraud. The contact purchased a 2013 Jeep Wrangler. The contact stated that while attempting to register the vehicle, it was discovered that there was a mileage discrepancy. The vehicle was a dealer sale. At the time of purchase, the vehicle mileage was 60,742 and at the time of registration, it was discovered that the mileage was 62,724.
The oil pressure sensor, I was in traffic and the vehicle came to a stop with scared the hell out me and this has hall a couple of time and came to find out it was caused by the oil pressure sensor. Why this is not on recall
when while I’m driving the vehicle will turn off . I already have this situation happened to me so many times while there’s cars next to me or in face of me
I own a 2013 Wrangler Unlimited. Since new, the parking brake has been ever-more-difficult to engage. On October 26, I was using the Jeep around my property and had to exit the vehicle while in neutral (auto transmission) and attempted to engage the parking brake.  If the handle is pulled slowly, SOMETIMES the brake engages enough to hold.  In this particular instance, I pulled the handle slowly, felt some resistance to indicate the brake engaged, and exited the vehicle.  The brake then relieved enough pressure to allow the vehicle to roll back into a hole form where a stump had been.  Fortunately I was not injured and the Jeep did not collide with anything.  This emphasized to me a previously-known safety issue with the product.  The design of the brake lever is supposed to be self-adjusting, however in reality, the clutch mechanism to do this allows slippage to the point where the handle hits the backstop prior to engaging the brakes on many Wrangler JKs that are only a few years old. This is a well documented problem in JK forums and many owners have created workarounds to force the mechanism to maintain tension on the parking brake cables. I have not done this to mine, and consequentially have not had a reliably functioning for years.  For obvious reasons, this flaw in the parking brake design (especially on vehicles offered with manual transmissions puts public safety at risk.   Ilderton Chrysler Jeep Dodge in Winston Salem failed this vehicle on safety inspection in 2020 as a result of this, but I did not authorize a diagnostic investigation, as I was already aware of the problem.  I was able to jiggle the parking brake enough to cause it to engage enough to pass inspection.  Within 1 - 2 pulls, the brake was completely unusable again.  I have checked parking brake shoe to drum clearance and verified that the rear is adjusted correctly for engagement. The problem only exists in the design of the lever.  No warning lamps related to the lever/integrated switch.
AIRBAG LIGHTS REMAIN ON, CRUISE CONTROL DOES NOT WORK, ALL CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL DO NOT WORK.  DOES NOT WORK WHEN DRIVING OR SETTING.  I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE WITH THIS PROBLEM AND WAS TOLD IT WAS A FUSE.  I FOUND OUT IT IS THE CLOCK SPRING.
LEAK  WHEN IT RAINS.. GUESSING SEAL ON DOOR
ENGINE DOES WHEN GOING INTO REVERSE AND SURGES WHEN DRIVING AT LOW THROTLE
CLOCKSPRING RECALL: OTHER YEAR MODELS OF THE SAME GENERATION WRANGLER SHOW A CLOCKSPRING RECALL, BUT MY YEAR MODEL DOESN'T. MY CLOCKSPRING HAS FAILED NOW AND I LOST MOST OF THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS, INCLUDING MY SAFETY HORN, AND IF MY RESEARCH IS CORRECT, MY DRIVER SIDE AIR BAG WILL NOT DEPLOY NOW IF IN A COLLISION ACCIDENT. WHEN TURNING MY WINDSHIELD WIPERS WOULD TURN ON RANDOMLY, AND THEN WHEN DRIVING SHORTLY AFTERWARDS I WENT TO HONK AT ANIMALS IN THE ROAD AND THE HORN DID NOT WORK. THE NEXT DAY I NOTICED THAT THE RADIO AND DRIVER INFORMATION CENTER CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL DID NOT WORK EITHER.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 JEEP WRANGLER. WHILE DRIVING HIGHWAY SPEEDS OVER A BUMP IN THE ROAD, THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY SHOOK, WOBBLED, AND VIBRATED. THE LOCAL DEALER AND MANUFACTURER WERE NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 25,000. THE VIN WAS UNKNOWN.
TRACTION CONTROL AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ILLUMINATED NOT ALLOWING ME TO ACCELERATE. THIS JEEP HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP ABOUT 30 TIMES AND THE PROBLEM IS STILL NOT RESOLVED, THEY ARE TELLING ME THAT I NEED A NEW WIRING HARNESS AND THAT THEY WILL NOT COVER IT BECAUSE THE WARRANTY IS EXPIRED  THIS HAS BEEN ONGOING SINCE 19000 MILES.

ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 23, 2018 AT APPROXIMATELY 12:20 I WAS DRIVING DOWN I820 SOUTH BOUND AT THE SPEED OF 65 MPH WHEN I HEARD A LOUD POP THAT SOUNDED LIKE A GUNSHOT, ABOUT 30 SECONDS OR LESS LATER THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE. THE STEERING WHEEL STARTED SHAKING AND I ALMOST LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. LUCKILY, I WAS IN THE FAR RIGHT LANE AND AT AN EXIT WHEN I REGAINED CONTROL AND I IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE EXIT AND  GOT TO THE SHOULDER OF THE SERVICE ROAD. IT APPEARS THE TIRE FAILED FROM THE SIDEWALK. SEE ATTACHED PICTURE UP CLOSE TO VIEW TWO SIDEWALL RUPTURES CONSISTANT WITH THE SOUNDS AND TIRE FAILURE. TIRE IS GOODYEAR EAGLE RSA WITH APPROXIMATELY 55% TREADLIFE REMAINING
AIRBAG LIGHT IS ON, CRUISE CONTROL (AS WELL AS ALL OTHER CONTROLS MOUNTED ON THE STEERING WHEEL) ARE INOPERABLE. THIS WAS GRADUAL; I NOTICED CRUISE CONTROL DIDN'T WORK FIRST, THEN THE REST OF THE CONTROLS INCLUDING THE AIRBAG STOPPED SHORTLY AFTER. THIS WAS DURING HIGHWAY DRIVING (A COAST-TO-COAST ROAD TRIP).
AIR BAG LIGHT CAME ON, NONE OF THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS INCLUDING THE HORN ARE WORKING.
THE VEHICLE HAS STOPPED BLOWING HOT AIR ON THE DRIVERS SIDE AND FEET BUT WILL BLOW HOT AIR ON PASSENGERS SIDE.  THIS LEADS TO ISSUES WITH DEFROSTING AND VISIBILITY AS WELL AS THE DRIVER BEING SAFE AND ABLE TO FEEL THEIR FINGERS AND FEET WHILE DRIVING.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER WHO SAYS THERE IS A STAR REPORT ON THIS ISSUE AND IT IS A WELL KNOWN ISSUE.  JEEP HOWEVER SAYS I AM OUT OF WARRANTY SO THEY WILL NOT FIX IT.  MY EXTENDED WARRANTY BOUGHT THROUGH THE DEALERSHIP SAYS THEY WILL NOT FIX IT.  THE RADIATOR, HEATER CORE OVER FLOW TANK AND ALL OTHER RELATED COMPONENTS ARE THE RECOMMENDED REPAIR.
WHEN ROUTINE MAINTENANCE WAS BEING PERFORMED AT THE DEALER THE TRANSMISSION CASE BROKE AROUND A PORTION OF THE CASE WHERE ONE OF THE TRANSMISSION OIL PAN BOLTED ON. ONE OF THE MECHANICS COMMENTED THAT THIS PORTION OF THE TRANSMISSION CASE APPEARED THIN. THE TRANSMISSION CASE WAS SENT BACK TO THE FACTORY BY THE DEALER. I BELIEVE THIS FAILURE OF THE METAL OF THE TRANSMISSION CASE IS DANGEROUS DUE TO THIS BEING A "TRAIL RATED" VEHICLE AND BEING INTENDED FOR EXPOSURE TO OFF ROAD CONDITIONS AND THIS PART FAILURE BEING ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS UNDER THESE CONDITIONS AND, OF COURSE, IF IT WERE TO FAIL IN REGULAR DRIVING. IT IS MY BELIEF THAT IF THIS FAILURE WERE TO OCCUR WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE COULD LOOSE POWER AND THUS LOOSE CONTROL AND UNDER OFF ROAD CONDITIONS COULD CREATE A VERY PRECARIOUS AND ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS CONDITION.  *TR
I HAVE 24,000 MILES AND NOTICED GRINDING COMING FROM MY PASSENGER REAR WHEEL. I WENT TO AN AUTO REPAIR SHOP. THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE CALIPER IS PARTIALLY FROZE AND NEEDED A NEW ONE. IT ALSO RUINED MY BRAKE AND ROTOR ON THAT SIDE. THEY ALSO RECOMMENDED TO NOT INSTALL ONE SIDE BUT TO MAKE BOTH MATCH. DUE TO A FAULTY CALIPER I AM OUT $500. THE AUTO MECHANIC SAID HE HAS ODDLY SEEN THIS ON RELATIVELY NEW JEEP WRANGLERS TOO FREQUENT. I WENT ONLINE AND FOUND OUT FROM JEEP FORUMS THAT THIS IS HAPPENING OFTEN. I'M NOT TOO SURE ON HOW THE RECALL PROCESS WORKS... BUT I WOULDN'T MIND TRYING TO RECOVER SOME/ALL OF MY COSTS DUE TO FAULTY OEM EQUIPMENT.

SEVERAL MILES FROM HOME I CROSSED A BRIDGE DOING BETWEEN 45 AND 50 MILES PER HOUR AND THE JEEP STARTED BOUNCING AND SHAKING SO BAD (LIKE IT HAD 4 SQUARE TIRES) AND VEERING TO THE LEFT.  I HAD NO CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE AS THE STEERING WHEEL WAS SHAKING SO HARD I HAD TROUBLE HOLDING ONTO IT.  I BRAKED REALLY SLOW AND KEPT IT ON THE ROAD TILL IT CAME TO A STOP.  I HAD JUST MET A VEHICLE ON A TWO LANE COUNTRY ROAD (WHICH ARE NOT VERY WIDE AND NO SHOULDER) AND WAS LUCKY THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE COMING TOWARDS ME, OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS/FATAL ACCIDENT.  THE DEALERSHIP LOOKED AT ONLY TO TELL ME THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE JEEP AND THAT I MUST DID NOT KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THE VEHICLE ON ROUGH ROADS.  MY HUSBAND DROVE THE JEEP FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AND NOTHING EVERY HAPPENED TO HIM.  OCTOBER 26, 2014....ONCE AGAIN I WAS CRUISING DOWN A HIGHWAY DOING 71 MPH AND THE JEEP STARTED BOUNCING ALL OVER THE ROAD......I DID NOT HIT A BUMP OR ANYTHING.  AGAIN FELT LIKE THE JEEP HAD 4 SQUARE TIRES AND I ENDED UP WITH 3 VENTI COFFEES ALL OVER THE INSIDE OF JEEP.  SEVERAL MILES LATER CROSSING A BRIDGE AT 35 MPH THE JEEP STARTED SHAKING ALL OVER AGAIN.  I LEFT WORD WITH THE SALESMANS AS TO WHAT HAPPENED AND ONCE AGAIN THE JEEP WENT IN ONLY TO BE TOLD THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE JEEP.  TODAY (JAN.9, 2015) MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING THE JEEP AND CROSSED THE SAME BRIDGE WHEN I HAD THE FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE SHAKING OF THE JEEP........NOW HE BELIEVES ME THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE JEEP.  HE CALLED THE SALESMAN AND TOLD HIM WHAT HAPPENED.......ONLY TO BE TOLD THEY WOULD LOOK INTO IT.  WE ARE AFRAID TO DRIVE THE JEEP BECAUSE ONE OF THESE TIMES WE WILL NOT BE SO LUCKY AS TO WALK AWAY FROM AN ACCIDENT......WE ARE AFRAID OF US AND ANOTHER FAMILY GETTING KILLED.  WHAT DOES IT TAKE FOR THIS TO BE CHECKED INTO SERIOUSLY........SOMEONE OR A WHOLE FAMILY GETTING KILLED?  *TR
WHILE DRIVING MY 2013 JEEP WRANGLER, AT CRUISING SPEED OF 45 MPH, THE INSTRUMENT PANEL STARTED FLASHING RANDOM EMERGENCY ICONS.  THIS FLASHING OF THE VEHICLES CLUSTER ALONG WITH SPEEDOMETER AND RPM GAUGE MOVING ERRATICALLY CONTINUED FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES UNTIL IT STOPPED AND ONLY THE TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT REMAINED ON. I PULLED OVER AND TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE.  I RESTARTED THE VEHICLE, WHICH SEEMED TO FIX THE ISSUE BECAUSE THE TRACTION LIGHT TURNED OFF AND EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE WORKING.  THIS IS THE FIRST INCIDENT IN WHICH THE LIGHTS FLASH CONTINUOUSLY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES, PRIOR INCIDENTS HAD ONLY FLASHED THE CLUSTER LIGHTS A COUPLE OF TIMES AND THEN THEY WENT BACK TO NORMAL.  I CONTACTED MY DEALERSHIP AND THEY INDICATED THEY HAVE ONLY RECEIVED REPORTS OF THIS ISSUE ON THE JEEP CHEROKEE.   *TR

THERE IS A POWER TRAIN RECALL ON MY JEEP.  THE DEALERSHIP CANT GET THE PART IN.  WE GOT THE NOTICE IN THE SUMMER.  HOW LONG DO THEY HAVE TO FIX THIS, AND WHAT STEPS CAN I TAKE NOW?  MY CAR IS IN THE SHOP NOW FOR ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM THAT THERE IS A SERVICE BULLETIN FOR.

The ABS module on my vehicle is faulty. Jeep is no longer manufacturing the part needed for repair. My vehicle is drivable but no longer has ABS. This is affecting a very large number of Jeep wranglers and stallantis / Jeep refuses to make a replacement part available or issue a recall.
ABS Module failure resulting in abs and traction control systems not functioning properly putting myself and others at risk for injury.  There is no replacement part available and Mopar indicates there is no current production for a replacement part.  This is a well known problem that the manufacturer has failed to provide a safe solution for.
The contact owns a 2014 Jeep Wrangler. The contact stated that while operating the vehicle, the tire pressure monitoring system displayed a straight line instead of the proper air pressure levels. The contact stated that the failure appeared for the front driver and front passenger side tires. The cause of the failure was not yet determined. The local dealer and manufacturer were notified of the failure and informed the contact that the VIN was not included in NHTSA Campaign Number: 14V632000 (Tires). The contact indicated that the vehicle had experienced the failure listed in the recall. The failure mileage was 105,000.
Oil cooler broke due to being made out of plastic. I had to have a new one installed made out of metal. Labor and parts were 855.00. I don’t think this should have happened both engine and driveway are covered in oil?
2014 jeep wrangler unlimited Sahara oil filter housing fail twice already. Causes oil to leak all over top of engine and then drips onto other components. Could cause fire, could cause engine to sieze, no warning lights to indicate an issue.
The oil filter and oil cooler assembly is plastic with plastic gaskets. It will often crack, or the gaskets will shrink/crack over time, particularly in cold weather conditions. This causes oil to leak down onto other components, specifically the transmission, transfer case, etc. in the case of an accident this oil leak and oil soaked components can represent a fire hazard. Also can become an engine oil overheating issue as the oil cooling is not working properly. Repair requires complete disassembly of the air intake system and manufacturer only supplies the same faulty plastic parts. Repair is extremely costly and it is a known defect that has caused many parts shortages.
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE CHRYSLER RECALL THE 3.6L V6 FOR THEIR OIL FILTER COOLER BASE BREAKING. I'M LUCKY MY VEHICLE DIDN'T CATCH FIRE WITH ALL THE HOT OIL RUNNING DOWN OVER THE ENGINE. THOUSANDS OF THESE MOTORS ARE IN THEIR PRODUCTS. AND ALL COST $1355 TO REPAIR. MINE WAS ONLY SERVICED AT THE DEALER, NO ONE ELSE. IT IS A WELL KNOWN DEFECT AND CHRYSLER IS STILL STICKING IT TO CUSTOMERS FOR REPAIRS. SURPRISED NO ONE HAS DIED IN A CAR FIRE.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 JEEP WRANGLER. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE OPERATING THE VEHICLE, THE ODOR OF BURNING OIL WAS PRESENT. UPON INSPECTION IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT ENGINE OIL HAD LEAKED ON THE EXHAUST SYSTEM.

I WAS JUST STARTING A DRIVE HOME WHEN SUDDENLY MY CARS "CHECK ENGINE" LIGHT CAME ON AND IT REFUSED TO GO HIGHER THAN 3RD GEAR. WITHIN MINUTES, MY ENGINE WAS STARTING TO OVERHEAT. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO COAST INTO A NEARBY AUTO REPAIR PLACE FOR THEM TO CHECK THINGS OUT. THEIR DIAGNOSIS WAS THAT MY OIL COOLING HOUSING CRACKED AND HAS BEEN LEAKING OIL EVERYWHERE, INCLUDING THE UNDERCARRIAGE (WHICH I'M TOLD IS A FIRE HAZARD). THEY ALSO SAID IT'S A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE 2014 MODELS AND THEY'RE SHOCKED JEEP HASN'T ISSUED A RECALL ON IT. I LATER DID SOME READING AND FOUND HUNDREDS, IF NOT THOUSANDS, OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. A RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED FOR THIS FAULTY PART INSTEAD OF MAKING ALL OF US PAY $750+ TO FIX IT.  *TR
THERE HAS BEEN MANY COMPLAINTS ON A REAR MAIN SEAL LEAK. MY VEHICLE IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO 150K MILES ITS BARELY AT 90K AND ALREADY HAVING A LEAK ISSUE.   I WAS READING ONLINE THAT CERTAIN JEEPS RIGHT AT 16K WERE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE. THIS IS COSTLY AND IT IS EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE THAT MY VEHICLE GOES FROM BEING GOOD TO DRIVE TO HEY NOW YOU HAVE A REAR MAIN SEAL LEAK AND IT WILL COST YOU AROUND 850 PLUS DOLLARS.   IT LEAKED OIL IN MY DRIVEWAY AND NOW I HAVE TO PAY SOMEONE TO CLEAR THAT UP.
TICKING NOISE FROM THE ENGINE ON BOTH DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDES. THE NOISE BECOMES LOUDER WHEN THE ENGINE GETS WARM, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS CLOSE TO A WALL OR OTHER VEHICLES. DIAGNOSTIC FROM DEALERSHIP SAYS IT IS DUE TO ROCKER ARM FAILURES.
THE OIL COOLER BROKE AND IS LEAKING OIL ALL OVER MY ENGINE, TRANSFER CASE AND EXHAUST. JEEP SAYS IT'S COMMON AND THEY EXPECT ME TO PAY $850 OUT OF MY POCKET FOR A PLASTIC PART THAT WILL FAIL AGAIN. SHAME ON THEM. IT WAS SITTING IN MY GARAGE AND OIL IS EVERYWHERE ON THE GROUND. IT'S TOO DANGEROUS TO DRIVE
DRIVING DOWN THE FREEWAY ALL DASH LIGHTS FLASH ON INCLUDING TRACTION LIGHT AND ABS AND FEELS LIKE MY BRAKES ARE PUMPING EVEN WHEN I DID NOT TOUCH THE BRAKES WITH DINGING SOUND RADIO SHUTS OFF, HORN DOES NOT WORK OR THE BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL TO WORK THE RADIO.

MOPAR OIL COOLER HOUSING, WHICH HOUSES A COOLER AND OIL FILTER, SITS ON THE ENGINE AND HAS CRACKED, CAUSING OIL TO LEAK OUT OF IT.  OIL LEAKS DOWN THE ENGINE AND ONTO THE TRANSMISSION HOUSING.  THIS IS A FIRE HAZARD AND A COMMON ISSUE WITH 2014'S, WHICH CAN BE FOUND VIA A QUICK AND SIMPLE GOOGLE SEARCH.  CAR WAS STATIONARY WHEN I DISCOVERED THE LEAK. CAR DEALERSHIP VERIFIED THE ISSUE AND SUPPLIED ME WITH AN ESTIMATE, STATING THIS IS A WELL KNOWN ISSUE.  ABOUT 3 HOUR REPAIR AND COULD COST 700-1100.

NOTICED WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A TRANSMISSION LEAK. AFTER SOME RESEARCH FOUND THAT IT'S OIL LEAKING FROM THE OIL COOLER ASSEMBLY. VEHICLE WAS DRIVEN APPROXIMATELY 30 MILES ON THE HIGHWAY THEN RETURNED HOME AND NOTICED OIL ON THE GARAGE FLOOR.
ENGINE OIL COOLER HOUSING CRACKING AND LEAKING OIL. I HAVE HAD IT IN TWICE IN 3 MONTHS TO HAVE THE HOUSING REPLACED. I KNOW OF OTHERS WITH THIS YEAR, 2014, JEEP WRANGLER THAT HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. YOU CAN SMELL THE OIL ON THE EXHAUST AND SEE THE OIL DRIPPING UNDER THE VEHICLE. I HAVE THE DEALER REPAIR ORDERS AND PARTS REPLACED AND THEY ARE THE SAME BOTH TIMES. NOW, WORRIED IT WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN EVEN AFTER MY WARRANTY RUNS OUT AND WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS. JEEP SHOULD EXTEND THE WARRANTY AS LONG AS I OWN IT OR PERMANENTLY FIX THE COOLER PROBLEM ON THESE MODELS.
I'VE NOTICED FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS LIKE LEAKAGE ON THE GROUND BUT HAVE YET TO PINPOINT THE EXACT LOCATION. I TOOK IT TO THE JEEP DEALERSHIP AND ASKED IF THEY HAVE HAD ANY ISSUES WITH LEAKS AND DANCED AROUND THE QUESTION AND SAID I WOULD NEED TO LEAVE IT FOR A MECHANIC TO LOOK AT IT, I ASKED IF MY WARRANTY WAS STILL VALID AND THE HAD RAN MY VIN AND SAID IT WAS EXPIRED......WHICH IS PUZZLING CAUSE I HAVE AROUND 30K MILES ON IT. SO I STILL HAVE A MYSTERY LEAK AND READING UP ON DIFFERENT FORUMS SEEMS TO BE ON ONGOING ISSUES WITH COOLING OIL LINES OR OIL FILTER ADAPTER, OIL COOLER.  *TR

AS STATED ON WWW.JEEPPROBLEMS.COM/TSBS/WRANGLER/2014/ A REPORT OF A MALFUNCTION ON THE OIL ENGINE PRESSURE SENSOR CIRCUIT HAS BEEN REPORTED AS MALFUNCTIONING. SEE BELOW.  DATE REPORTED:  JUNE 06, 2014  NHTSA REFERENCE:  #10056046  TSB REFERENCE:  #SB-18-034-14  DESCRIPTION: ON SOME MODEL VEHICLES AND JEEPS, (MY 2013-2014)MALFUNCTION INDICATOR LAMP (MIL) ILLUMINATES AND DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE CODE (DTC) IS SET REGARDING ENGINE OIL PRESSURE SENSOR CIRCUIT.     IN ORDER FOR US TO CORRECT THE ISSUE WE HAVE TO TAKE THE VEHICLE INTO THE JEEP FACILITY PAY $100.00 FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC CHECK TO BE COMPLETED AND AN ADDITIONAL $252.00 FOR THE CIRCUIT TO BE CORRECTED AND REPLACED. THE VEHICLE CURRENTLY HAS 47,000 ON IT AND AFTER WE SPOKE WITH JEEP CORPORATE THEY SPECIFIED THAT THE ONLY WAY THEY WOULD EVEN LOOK INTO IT IS FOR US TO HAS THE SERVICE DONE AND PROVIDE THEM WITH A TICKET NUMBER. THIS IS UNDERSTANDABLE BUT THE LOCAL JEEP COMPANY LOCATED IN JACKSONVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA ONLY HAS A NEXT AVAILABLE APPOINTMENT 5 DAYS FROM NOW ON JANUARY 11, 2016. THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE WITH US DRIVING THE VEHICLE AS THIS VEHICLE IS ALSO THE VEHICLE THAT TRANSPORTS A CHILD WITH A BRAIN INJURY FROM A VEHICLE ACCIDENT. SO FROM OUR UNDERSTANDING WE CAN EITHER DRIVE THE VEHICLE WHICH COULD POSSIBLY LOCK UP BECAUSE THE ENGINE IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH OIL PRESSURE TO IT, OR , WE CAN WAIT 5 DAYS WITH NOT DRIVING OUR VEHICLE AND HAVE THE MALFUNCTION CORRECTED. WE WERE INFORMED THAT THEY WOULD NOT CORRECT THE ISSUE FOR FREE BECAUSE TECHNICALLY IT HAS NOT BEEN PLACED ON A RECALL LIST AS OF YET. THIS IS PUTTING FAMILIES IN DANGER AND UNCALLED FOR. ESPECIALLY WHEN THE MALFUNCTION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE COMPANY ITSELF.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 JEEP WRANGLER. WHILE THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS DEPRESSED, THE ENGINE STALLED WITHOUT WARNING. THE VEHICLE RESTARTED, BUT THE FAILURE RECURRED NUMEROUS TIMES. THE DEALER COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 9,000.
MALFUNCTION INDICATOR LIGHT COMES ON REPEATEDLY.  IMPLAUSIBLE DATA REPORTED FROM A MODULE THAT THE DEALERSHIP CLAIMS IS NOT EVEN IN THE VEHICLE.  OCCASIONALLY THE VEHICLE WILL NOT GO ABOVE ABOUT 1800 RPM AND 15 MILES AN HOUR.  AT OTHER TIMES THE RPMS WILL SURGE UP INTO THE 5000-6000 RANGE AND NOT SHIFT OUT OF 1ST GEAR.  DEALERSHIPS CLAIM THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS BUT THE SHIFTING PROBLEM CONTINUES TO OCCUR AND THE MALFUNCTION INDICATOR LIGHT KEEPS COMING ON.  *TR
OIL LEAK DUE TO CRACKED OIL COOLER HOUSING. RISK OF ENGINE FIRE.  *TR
WENT TO STOP AT LIGHT, HIT THE BRAKE IT WAS HARD AND DID NOT ENGAGE, I STOPPED BECAUSE I HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. BRAKES NEVER ENGAGED, PULLED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE BEFORE EXITING THE VEHICLE TO CHECK ON THE PEOPLE IN THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME AND THE BRAKES SEEMED TO LET OUT AIR AND RELAX. THE BRAKES FELT NORMAL AT THAT POINT. POST ACCIDENT POLICE ESCORTED BE TO DEALERSHIP TO MAKE SURE THAT BRAKES CONTINUED TO WORK. DEALERSHIP CLAIMED NOTHING WRONG, SPOKE TO NEUTRAL MECHANICS AND THEY ALL STATED THAT IT WAS A PROBLEM THAT WOULD OCCUR AGAIN AND THAT THE BRAKES WOULD SEEM FINE IN THE MEANTIME. EXPLAINED THIS TO JEEP AND THEY SAID BRAKES WERE FINE.  *TR
On July 27, 2025 the brake, ABS, and traction control lights lit up on my dash panel. The problem is a C2200 code which means the ABS module has gone bad. There has been a back-order of this part for several years now with no indication of when or if this module will ever be made available again.
Parking, brake, and abs alert lights constantly alert on the dash.  When reaching approximately 50mph the steering wheel and vehicle begin to shake and wobble excessively, and the vehicle moves side to side in the road requiring an almost complete stop to control the vehicle.  The brake pedals go almost to floor of vehicle taking longer to stop and at times require pumping. ABS module code #C2200 per dealer. ABS module unable to be ordered, no ETA. Reports an ongoing issue for about 2 years with Jeep ABS modules.  Vehicle is not safe to drive.
Lack of oil in the heads after sitting for a while results in dry valve train at start up and over time results in premature failure of hydraulic lifters not pumping up and rocker arms and cams being dry until oil reaching these parts.
My horn and all my steering wheel controls just stopped working due to a failure of the clock spring. This should be a recall as it's a safety issue.
What component or system failed or malfunctioned, and is it available for inspection upon request? The component that failed is the oil filter housing/assembly. It was changed out by the Pep Boys I do not have it on hand but upon research it appears that this is a known issue on the 3.6 and the 3.2 Chrysler Pentastar engines. Mopar made this part out of entirely plastic and it is now failing on a ton of vehicles. The replacement parts are all made out of metal/aluminum.  Safety: this not only put myself at a safety risk but also puts other motorists on the road at risk. Not to mention the environmental safety that this can cause.   The plastic part contains the oil filter for the engine. After time it warps and fails causing cracks and seal leaks that allows oil to drain out of the engine, onto the transmission manifold and all over the ground/road. There is no warning for this, one day you will walk out and find your vehicle bleeding all of its oil all over the pavement. This could happen to anyone at any time. I would hate to be on a motorcycle driving behind a Chrysler engine when their engine decides to fall apart and slick up the expressway with motor oil. Jeep/Chrysler knows that this is happening, they know it’s a problem because the replacement part is made of metal instead of plastic, and they refuse to do anything about this even under warranty. This is a part that is NEVER supposed to go bad on any cars, this is NOT a wear and tear part. I would like to see them held accountable for their (lack of) actions.
It went into severe vibration and vibration of steering. It was uncontrollable. It happened in my first highway trip since I purchased the vehicle. The vehicle had to be towed 100 miles. Cost of this was $5697.97. After I paid $30,000+. to Autonation in Spring Texas. Car was released to me with no inspection sticker. Electrical issues were looked at by the dealership and said there is nothing wrong. Can not see at night and turning signals work on and off.  Defective roof seals that are leaking into the seatbelt tensioners. When I pull seatbelts to buckle they are wet. The tensioners are sitting in water when it rains.
2015 Jeep Wrangler 66,000 mi on it rocker arms are rattling need to be replaced it's a problem at all 2015 what I understand
APOLOGIES IF THIS COMPLAINT IS A REPEAT, BUT I KEEP GETTING A SUBMISSION ERROR NOTICE WHENEVER I TRY TO SUBMIT THIS FORM.    THE JEEP 4.0 LITER SIX CYLINDER ENGINE HAS A KNOWN DEFECT WITH RESPECT TO THE ROCKER ARM BEARINGS THAT CAUSES A LOUD TICKING NOISE IN THE ENGINE AND FAILURE OF THE EXHAUST AND INTAKE CAMSHAFTS.  THIS HAPPENED TO OUR 2015 JEEP IN JANUARY 2020 WHEN IT HAD ONLY 31,000 MILES BUT WAS ONE MONTH OUT OF WARRANTY.  CHRYSLER DID FIX IT AT THAT TIME AS A COURTESY SUBJECT TO A $100 FEE, AND A COPY OF THE INVOICE FOR THAT REPAIR IS PROVIDED.  UNFORTUNATELY, A LITTLE OVER ONE YEAR LATER, AND WITH LESS THAN 10,000 MILES HAVING BEEN DRIVEN SINCE THE INITIAL REPAIR, THE SAME PROBLEM HAS REAPPEARED.  THE DEALER IS NOW CLAIMING THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE REMAINING ROCKERS THAT WERE NOT REPLACED, AS IT IS CHRYSLER'S POLICY TO ONLY REPLACE THE ROCKER ARMS AND CAMSHAFTS THAT ARE DAMAGED AT THAT TIME.  THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE DEALER SAYS THAT THEY "SEE THIS ALL THE TIME" AND THAT THEY TRY TO GET ALL THE ROCKER ARMS REPLACED WHEN DOING ANY REPAIRS, BUT CHRYSLER DOES NOT ALLOW THEM TO DO SO.  OF COURSE, CHRYSLER IS NOW REFUSING TO COVER THE REPAIRS, EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIXED THE FIRST TIME.  THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE, AND CHRYSLER SHOULD BE FORCED TO DO A FULL RECALL OF ALL AFFECTED ENGINES AND PAY FOR ALL REQUIRED REPAIRS.  THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM ONLINE, YET CHRYSLER STILL REFUSES TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM.
WHILE DRIVING THE JEEP SHUTS OFF. IT IS HARD TO STEER AND HAPPENS WITHOUT WARNING.  THIS HAS HAPPENED ABOUT 10 TIMES IN THE LAST MONTH. IT DOES NOT THROW A CODE SO THE DEALER CAN NOT FIX IT.
AFTER HITTING A BUMP IN THE ROAD MY JEEP SHOOK VIOLENTLY.  I STOPPED THE JEEP TO SEE IF SOMETHING BROKE. WHEN I STARTED DRIVING AGAIN EVERYTHING WAS FINE. I HAD IT CHECKED OUT AT JEEP BUT NOTHING WAS FOUND.  AFTER MONTHS OF EVERYTHING BEING FINE I NOTICED A SHAKE IN THE STEERING WHEEL. TIRES WERE CHECKED AND FINE. NO ONE COULD EXPLAIN WHY THERE WAS VIBRATION AT SPEEDS AROUND 55 MPH. THIS HAPPENED A FEW TIMES AND THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE. A YEAR LATER I HIT A SMALL BUMP IN A CONSTRUCTION AREA ON THE HIGHWAY, THE SAME VIOLENT SHAKING HAPPENED. I WAS IN A CONSTRUCTION ZONE NEXT TO A DIESEL TRUCK WITH CONCERT BARRIER ON BOTH SIDES.I HAD A HARD TIME KEEPING CONTROL OF MY JEEP. THE DEATH WOBBLE IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM.     IT HAS BEEN SAID THAT JEEP HAS COME UP WITH A BAND-AID FIX. WELL AFTER TAKING MY JEEP TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WITH ONLY 40,000 MILES ON MY JEEP(MY JEEP NOW OUT OF WARRANTY, I HAD AN EXTENDED WARRANTY) AND IT COST ME OVER 3,055.45 FOR THEM TO FIX THE DEATH WOBBLE. I DO HAVE AN INVOICE FOR THE CHARGES IT IS NOT ON ME AT THIS TIME.
OIL FILTER HOUSING HAS CRACKED AND LEAKING OIL. APPEARS TO BE WIDESPREAD PROBLEM.
HOOD VIOLENTLY FLUTTERS AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.   HAD TO PULL OVER.  HAD TO PURCHASE AFTER MARKET STURDY HOOD LATCHES TO REPLACE THE FACTORY ONES.
WAS DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY WHEN THE PASSENGER SIDE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF SMOKE, PULLED OVER AND THERE WAS A SMALL FIRE, MULTIPLE FIRE EXTINGUISHERS FAILED TO PUT OUT THE FIRE AND IT SPREAD ENGULFING THE ENTIRE JEEP AND POP UP CAMPER UNTIL THEY WERE BOTH TOTAL LOSSES
MY 2015 JEEP WRANGLER WITH LESS THAN 36,000 MILES (CURRENT MILEAGE IS 31,000) DEVELOPED A HOLE IN THE UPPER RIGHT (FACING THE VEHICLE) ON THE RADIATOR. ONLY FACTORY AUTHORIZED ANTIFREEZE WAS IN THE  COOLING SYSTEM. IN FACT, THE COOLANT HAD NEVER BEEN TOUCHED SINCE PURCHASING IT NEW APRIL 17TH, 2015. THIS PAST FALL I KNEW I HAD A LEAK AND TOOK IT TO THE DEALER. THEY SAID IT WAS LEAKING OIL AROUND MY OIL FILTER AND ENDED UP CHARGING ME $46.00 FOR AN OIL CHANGE; HOWEVER, THE MECHANIC (PETE) COULD NOT EXPLAIN THE LEAK. I FELT THE FLUID ON MY GARAGE FLOOR WITH MY FINGERS AND HONESTLY THOUGHT IS WAS PART OIL AND ANTIFREEZE. NOW, ON WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 26, 2018 THEY ARE GOING TO REPLACE THE RADIATOR AND THE DEALER'S ESTIMATE WAS APPROXIMATELY $800.00 DOLLARS. IN SHORT, NO RADIATOR SHOULD BLOW A HOLE IN THE SIDEWALL OF THE RADIATOR WITH SO FEW MILES AND TIME.
WHEN DRIVING IN 1ST (MANUAL TRANSMISSION) IT JERKS OUT OF GEAR.  OCCASSIONALY IT WILL DO IT IN 2ND GEAR AS WELL. JEEP TRIED TO FIX THE "RECALL" ON THIS, BUT IN REALITY ITS NOT THE CORRECT "FIX" FOR THE ISSUE.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 JEEP WRANGLER. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 35 MPH OR MORE, THE VEHICLE WOULD SHAKE VIOLENTLY WHEN IT DROVE OVER THE SMALLEST BUMP. THE EXPRESSWAY DODGE CHRYSLER JEEP RAM DEALER IN EVANSVILLE, IN (5531 E INDIANA ST) WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS OPERABLE, BUT THE CONTACT DID NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING. THE VEHICLE WAS CURRENTLY AT THE DEALER AWAITING A DIAGNOSIS. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED. THE VIN WAS UNKNOWN. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 4,000.
VEHICLE ENGINE SHUTS DOWN UNEXPECTEDLY AT HIGHWAY AND LOW SPEEDS. DIFFICULT TO RESTART. DIFFICULT TO PUT IN GEAR. VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION WHEN ENGINE SHUT DOWN.
I WAS ON A ROAD TRIP TRAVELING 70 MPH ON I90 WITH CRUISE CONTROL SET WHEN CRUISE CONTROL DISENGAGED 3 TIMES ON ITS OWN THEN APPROXIMATELY 100 MILES LATER THE POWER OUTLET IN DASH CAUGHT FIRE (BEHIND DASH) AND SPREAD TO THE HEATER/AC CONTROL PANEL.  I ENDED TRAILERING MY JEEP HOME.  IT IS DRIVABLE BUT I TOOK IT TO DEALER TO CHECK IT OUT (THEY CALLED CHRYSLER (THEY'RE SENDING OUT THEIR OWN INVESTIGATORS)).  MY JEEP JUST TURNED A YEAR OLD AND LESS THAN 4000 MILES.
WE BOUGHT OUR JEEP IN JULY 2015. WENT ON VACATION TO OREGON IN AUGUST 2015 AND THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  WE DROVE TO WINCHESTER BAY TO A JEEP DEALER WHERE THEY DIAGNOSED THAT A CYLINDER MISFIRED. BUT THEY SAID TO DRIVE IT BACK TO CALIFORNIA TO THE JEEP DEALER WHERE WE BOUGHT IT.  AFTER THAT WHEN DRIVING THE JEEP THE TRACTION LIGHT COMES ON AND AT THE SAME TIME THE ACCELERATOR STOPS WORKING. THE LIGHT STAYS ON FOR ABOUT 4-6 SECONDS, BUT SO DOES THE ACCELERATOR. THIS WAS HAPPENED 9 DIFFERENT TIMES.  WE HAVE TAKEN THE JEEP INTO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND THEY KEEP THE JEEP FOR A WEEK.  THIS HAPPENED 3 TIMES, SO FOR 3 WEEKS WE DIDN'T HAVE OUR JEEP AND HAD TO RENT A CAR (WHICH JEEP PROVIDED). THEY WERE UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE TRACTION LIGHT GOING ON. AFTER THE THIRD TIME, THE DEALER WOULD NOT LET US BRING IN OUR JEEP TO THEM SO WE HAD TO CALL THE JEEP SOLUTION, WHICH IS A JOKE.  THEY ONLY TRY TO FIND ANOTHER DEALER TO LOOK AT IT.  SO WE TOOK IT TO ANOTHER DEALER AND THEY WERE UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE SAME PROBLEM.  THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHEN THE TRACTION LIGHT COMES ON AND THE ACCELERATOR STOPS WORKING, HOW DANGEROUS IT IS WHEN DRIVING 70 MPH IN TRAFFIC AND THEN THE SPEED GOES DOWN TO 63 IN SECONDS.  I WAS FLIPPED OFF, CUT OFF AND YELLED OUT BY OTHER DRIVES WHO THOUGHT I WAS SLOWING DOWN ON PURPOSE.  I HAVE BEEN RENTING CARS TO DRIVE LONG DISTANCES BECAUSE I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE IT ON THE FREEWAY TOO FAR.  SOME ONE NEEDS TO FIX OUR JEEP AND UNDERSTAND HOW DANGEROUS THIS IS. WE ARE AGAIN TAKING THE JEEP TO ANOTHER DEALER TO LOOK AT IT.  THIS WILL BE THE 5TH TIME IN THE DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE.  BECAUSE THE ENGINE LIGHT IS NOT GOING ON THEY SAID THEY CAN NOT SEE THAT THE TRACTION LIGHT CAME ON.  IS THAT POSSIBLE?  PLEASE HELP!

Side impact and full 6 rollovers, with damage to front. During an accident on 6/13/25. I took pictures if you need them
ABS module inoperative, needs replaced. Brake light,ABS light and downhill assist lights all illuminated as dash warning lights. Jeep has no replacment or repair option available. This is my second report for this problem.
Loss of ABS, Traction Control
The ABS Traction Control Module in this year, and surrounding year, Jeep Wranglers continues to fail. Now Jeep has stated that the part is under engineering review and not available till June timeframe.  Therefore, these vehicles no longer have anti lock brakes or traction control safety features.  This is a widespread issue and should be a recall on these modules.
I have a 2016 Jeep Wrangler that I purchased in 2017. The vehicle does not have over 45,000 miles on it...yet it would not crank.....when it finally cranked, within a few feet it completely shut down....the dealer stated that it was the TIPM. that needs to be replaced.....after reading the complaint comments on several sites...I wanted to know why this part has not been recalled to date.  This repair is very costly to me, and during these hard economic times, this process has been extremely stressful.  The dealer stated that it might take up to 4 weeks to get my jeep back..this is soooo unfair that I would have to incorporate an additional cost that should have been recalled already.....Recall this Jeep wrangler asap please!!!..Thank you, [XXX].

I DID A BIT OF RESEARCH AND IT SEEMS THAT THE MECHANISMS IN THESE DOORS FAIL OFTEN AS OTHERS REPORT THE SAME ISSUE. A 2016 VEHICLE WITH DOORS THAT DO NOT FUNCTION IS , ON MY MIND, A SAFETY ISSUE. CHRYSLER REFUSES TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER OR HELP IN ANYWAY BECAUSE OF THE MILEAGE ON THE VEHICLE. I HOPE NO ONE IS SERIOUSLY INJURED OR DIES BECAUSE THE DOOR WILL NOT OPEN ON ONE OF THESE CARS.

ABS module failed 2 years ago. No traction control, no cruise control, no stability management. This part has been on backorder for 2 years and affects many years. Issue started intermittently about 3 years ago while driving, now the vehicle is extremely unstable in wet conditions. Dealership has diagnosed and said to check back every few months for a solution. Additionally the plastic oil filter housing has been replaced 2 times in 2 years at a cost of $1,200, the second install was covered by parts warranty. Dealers won't install the metal version available on other years that do not have a cracking issue, aftermarket metal versions are available but dealers won't install them.
The contact owns a 2017 Jeep Wrangler. The contact stated while driving at an undisclosed speed, he heard an abnormal ticking sound emanating from the engine compartment, after which the vehicle lost significant motive power. The contact was able to pull to the shoulder of the roadway. After a visual inspection, the contact observed an oil leak underneath the engine compartment. The check engine warning light was illuminated. The vehicle was towed to an independent mechanic, who diagnosed a failure with the piston in cylinder #3. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure but provided no assistance. The failure mileage was 52,000.
2017 Jeep Wrangler,  approx 46k miles, driven gently (only highway and city), well-maintained. Problems with Brake Calipers seizing.  Back Driver calipers/lines/pad/etc replaced.  ABS and brakes jammed last week. Front and Back Passenger calipers, rotors, brake fluid lines and brake pads advised by mechanic. Brakes temping 550 - unreadable (temp gun wouldn't register)  Mechanic recommends unsafe to drive because brakes could seize and cause sudden stop and/or accident  Dealer says too bad, normal wear and tear. This is our family's 10th Jeep, and NOTHING has happened like this before.  Seems like a safety issue perhaps that Jeep should be addressing rather than putting on the consumer (who will no longer purchase Jeeps)
Heater core constantly “clogs” and no longer blows hot air on drivers side of the vehicle. Either through the defroster vents or floor vents, this makes it difficult to defrost the drivers side windshield or side window (can’t see side mirror!).  Jeep wants me to spend &3500 to replace entire system!!!
The car brakes failed Thursday May 5, 2021 while I was in the open road. The car did not have any prior warning sign indicating there was an issue with the brakes until after the fact, which with the help of the emergency brake I was able to park on the side of the road and have a towing company pick it up. My car has been at the dodge, Jeep Wrangler dealership since. I contacted the dealer that sold me the car “EchoPark at Grand Prairie” in Texas, the dealer was aware that the brake pads were well below 50% of useful life when they sold me that car that was ultimately the thing that caused my brakes to fail and they’ve refused to pay for the damages occurred, or compensate me in any sort of way. I believe my life and my friends life(a pregnant woman) who was my passenger was put at risk because the dealership failed to check on an item that needed to be check before the car was sold to me. I’ve keep calling the dealership where the car was purchased and they only paying for the broken Caliper through a extended warranty and refused to pay for the additional damaged Ive incurred due to their negligence.
I had already had to replace 2 rear seat belts in my wrangler over a year ago.  Both seat belts tore completely in half.  The cost for the seat belts alone was 500.  A year later, I had another seat belt rip in half.  One that was already replaced ripped right in half again. I only occasionally have had anyone in the back seat.  Possibly once a week.  Now, I cannot put anyone, especially children in the back seat of my 4 door, so called 5 passenger jeep because it is not safe.  the seat belts fray and rip.
OIL LEAKS FROM THE OIL COOLER HOUSING AT 34000 MILES
ABS AND TRACTION SENSORS COME ON WHEN TURNING LEFT.  ABS SOMETIMES DEPLOYS WHEN THESE LIGHTS ARE ON WHEN BRAKING.  SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING IN A VEHICLE THAT IS 3 YEARS OLD. I AM HEARING THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM IN JEEP WRANGLERS FROM THIS TIME PERIOD.
MY 2017 JEEP WRANGLER NEEDS A NEW CLOCKSPRING. BOTH MY 2008 AND 2012 JEEP WRANGLER HAD RECALLS ON THE CLOCKSPRING. WHY IS THERE NOT A RECALL ON THE 2017?
AFTER BACKING UP MY JEEP AND PLACING IT IN DRIVE I NOTICED MY STABILITY CONTROL LIGHT CAME ON AND MY JEEP STOPS.
THE ENTIRE BODY OF THE JEEP HAS RUST CORROSION INSIDE AND OUT  THE GEARS ALWAYS GRIND ESPECIALLY IN REVERSE   SEATBELTS ARE NOT WORKING IN REAR SEATS  DEALSHIP SAYS THEY CAN'T HELP ME FIX THE ISSUE. THEY DID A LEAK TEST AND FOUND SEVERAL LEAKS THROUGHOUT THE JEEP.   I CURRENTLY HAVE NO CARPET DUE TO THE OFF AND ON LEAK ISSUES. AND THE SMELL IS SO BAD I CAN'T DRIVE THE JEEP.   I HAVE A THREE YEAR OLD GRANDSON AND I'M SCARED TO TAKE A TRIP WITH HIM. I FEEL THIS PARTICULAR JEEP IS UNSAFE IN SEVERAL WAYS.

THERE WAS A RECALL ON OTHER 2017 VEHICLES FOR AN ELECTRICAL SYSTEM:WIRING:FRONT UNDERHOOD WHERE THE POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE MAY BE EQUIPPED WITH A VOLTAGE REGULATOR CHIP IN THE CIRCUIT BOARD THAT MAY FAIL, CAUSING A STALL OR A NO START CONDITION. CAN YOU PLEASE CHECK IF THIS IS SIMILAR BECAUSE WE JUST PICKED UP THE VEHICLE ON 10-05-18 AFTER NOTHING WAS FOUND WRONG AND ONLY A COMPUTER UPDATE WAS DONE. WE HAD THE CAR FOR A DAY AND IT IS ON ITS WAY BACK TO ONTARIO JEEP TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIND OUT WHATS WRONG. PLEASE ADVISE WHAT COULD BE DONE.
JEEP WRANGLER HARD ROCK 2017 ON FIRE 4 DAYS AFTER SERVICE! MY 2 YEARS OLD AND I WERE IN THE CAR. ONCE I PARKED THE CAR IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE, SMOKE CAME FROM THE ENGINE, WE WENT OUT AND JEEP CAUGHT ON FIRE AFTER FEW MINUTES. WE USED 3 BIG FIRE EXTINGUISHERS STILL CAN'T PUT OUT THE FIRE. JEEP BURNT FOR 15 MINS UNTIL FIREMEN PUT THAT OUT. ALL FOAM WENT INTO OUR FISH POND AND KILLED ALL THE FISH! BRAND NEW CAR WE BOUGHT LAST YEAR, UNDER 10,000 MILES, PASSED SERVICE FROM DEALER 4 DAYS BEFORE THE FIRE. NEITHER THE POLICE NOR INSURANCE COMPANY NOR JEEP DEALERSHIP CAN TELL YOU WHY. CAR NEVER WRECKED AND TOTALLY NO SIGNALS POPPED UP BEFORE THE FIRE.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2017 JEEP WRANGLER. WHILE DRIVING VARIOUS SPEEDS, THE VEHICLE INDEPEDENTLY VEERED TO THE LEFT WITHOUT WARNING. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS AND A WHEEL ALIGNMENT WAS PERFORMED BOTH TIMES, BUT THE FAILURE RECURRED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 22.
The engine blew while I was driving on the highway without warning. Several repairs since January and have had the car at just 2 years. Maintenance has been kept. Dealership replaced radiator, head gasket repair, etc. since just February. Car was towed to dealership. 2 holes in engine at the bottom. Dealership claims they don't know why. After researching this particular engine and car, I feel that vehicle has a lot of issues. I don't feel that it is safe. I think a safety recall should be considered.
The contact owns a 2018 Jeep Wrangler. The contact stated while driving at an undisclosed speed, the ABS warning light illuminated. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic where it was diagnosed with a failed clock spring. The contact was informed that the clock spring needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. In addition, the contact stated that several of the steering wheel safety features were inoperable due to the failure. The dealer was made aware of the failure. The contact was informed that a diagnostic test was needed to determine the cause of the failure. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was 35,000.
The brake line and caliper. The safety of myself and my children were at risk. Yes it has been confirmed as a problem from a dealer mechanic. It has not been inspected by police or others listed. There were no warnings or symptoms. It started smoking and the car shook while driving. This has now happened twice.
The instrument cluster panel on my 2018 Jeep Wrangler shut down in December, 2024, with no advance warning. I purchased my Jeep in March, 2019, and per my dealership, it currently has 38,488 miles. I was told that I would have to bring my Jeep and leave it with them so they could order the part and replace the instrument cluster panel. They advised the repair would be completed by 1/3/2025. When I contacted them on 1/3, I was advised that the instrument cluster was on back order and had no additional information as to when it would be received. I have received no further information from the dealership. However, I found that there was a recall by the FCA US LLC on this part which included 2018 Jeep Wranglers. I called the FCA US LLC Customer Center on 1/7/2025 and after being on hold for 90 minutes, I finally was able to speak with “Dave” and explain the issue. Although he advised that my Jeep was not recalled, he created my Case #[XXX], and advised the Specialty Department would call me within 1 business day. As of today, 1/10/2025 I still have not received any such call, nor have I heard anything more from the dealership. How am I supposed to get this fixed when nobody is able to help me?!

While driving at 55 mph the brake light, service abs system, check engine light, service 4wd, service transmission, loss of power steering, and engine cooling fan ran very fast. I was lucky to pull off the road and put the vehicle in Park. The 4 Way flashers would blink erratically. Engine still running wouldn't come out of Park. I turned the vehicle off.l let it set a few minutes. I then restarted the vehicle and it shifted into gear and drove home with the check engine light on. The next day it had no check engine light.
The contact owns a 2018 Jeep Wrangler. The contact stated that immediately after the vehicle was serviced under NHTSA Campaign Number: 23V116000 (Power Train) the "Service Transmission" and "Clutch Overheating" warning lights intermittently illuminated while operating the vehicle. The vehicle was taken back to the dealer who performed additional services on the vehicle, but the failure persisted. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The contact stated that the failure had not occurred prior to the recall repair. The failure mileage was 65,000.
Clutch - The Sansone Dealer located in Avenel, NJ has informed me that they did not have the part at the time and that I would receive a call.  I never got a call so I decided to take the car back to them and now I'm being told they would need to hold onto the car for at least 48-hrs to diagnose the car.  I don't understand why when they should be aware of the recall.
I have had the rear defroster tab re soldered at dealer under warranty. I don't use the rear defroster because it is parked in garage. After a cold spell at the end of January 2024 heading out on road trip I turned on the rear defroster, 5 minutes down the road the rear window exploded sending glass everywhere. When inspecting the broken window I noticed a burn mark on a sticker where the tab is connected to the glass. This could have caused an accident if traveling on the highway. Jeep has been repairing window tabs when they should be replacing the entire window.
The contact owns a 2018 Jeep Wrangler. The contact stated while driving 45 MPH, she became aware that the electric power steering was not functioning properly after the steering wheel locked in position. The contact was able to pull to the shoulder of the roadway to restart the vehicle, and the power steering functionality returned. The contact stated that several unknown warning lights were illuminated. The vehicle was taken to the dealer, who diagnosed a failure with the alternator. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was 55,000. The VIN was not available.
The contact owns a 2018 Jeep Wrangler. The contact received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 23V116000 (Power Train) however, the part to do the recall repair was not yet available. The local dealer was made aware of the issue and confirmed that parts were not yet available. The contact stated that the manufacturer had exceeded a reasonable amount of time for the recall repair. The manufacturer was made aware of the issue. The contact had not experienced a failure. VIN tool confirms parts not available.
The power steering with no warning, just quits, working, get warning signs that the ABS is not working, included with the traction control.
While operating the vehicle, I lost Power Steering, Stability Control, Anti-Lock Brakes and when I was able to stop, the transmission was put into park and I was unable to shift gears.  Dealership informed me that this is a known issue related to the Can Bus Connector located behind the glove compartment, which apparently controls all of the safety systems. There were multiple indicators lit on the dashboard along with a check engine light. Dealership is replacing the connector.
My wife was driving her Jeep to work this morning and a warning message came on the info screen stating the vehicle was shutting down soon and to safely pull over. She only had a two minute warning which was not enough time to pull over to a safe place without risking injury from being hit from another vehicle. The Jeep ended up and powered down within the two minutes of receiving the warning which caused loss of engine power, no power steering and no power brakes. This seems to be a pretty dangerous combination. It literally left her in the roadway. We had the batteries checked and they are ok. The vehicle did start back but the warning light came on again so it is parked until we can get it towed to the dealership. Researching it online it seems to be a common issue with the 2018 JLU. She currently has 117,000 miles on the Jeep.
Service start stop warning light comes on then service traction control then all dash warning lights come on then you lose power steering This all happens in seconds
death wobble at 70MPH Steering dampener had been replaced by Jeep a couple of years ago. Death wobble is back. this must be addressed
I had experienced the "death wobble" when I first bought my 2018 Jeep Wrangler JL in 2018.  A recall repair was done replacing the dampener.  Here we are in 2022 and I am beginning to experience the death wobble again.  The dealership says the dampener is bad and Chrysler will not replace it.  I don't think the "dampener" is the issue.  It will be at my expense to fix.
Going over a bridge at 55mph my vehicle went into a vigorous shaking in the front end making it uncontrollable to steer. I had to decrease speed right away to avoid going into another vehicle or the side of the bridge. Once, on the other side, I pulled over to come to a complete stop and was able to continue to my destination about 1-2 miles away at reduced speed. This is commonly known as “The Death Wobble” at the dealerships and Jeep community. It was taken in that day and returned the next day as they replaced the Steering Damper, which I’ve been told will not fix this problem. We will just have to see what happens next.
The contact owns a 2018 Jeep Wrangler.  The contact stated that while driving the display screen went blank. The contact stated that several unknown warning lights were illuminated. The vehicle lost power steering and was shaking. The vehicle was taken to the local dealer where it was diagnosed that the battery and sensors needed to be replaced. The vehicle was repaired; however, the failure recurred. The vehicle also failed to start. The vehicle was towed back to the local dealer but was not diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and referred the contact to the NHTSA. The failure mileage was approximately 61,000.
In the middle of the intersection, the power steering turned off and the steering wheel locked. I could not move the steering. All dashboard lights came on as well as the emergency brakes. The gear shift also locked and refused to shift into any toner gear. The vehicle was completely disabled and would not restart. This is the 5 time this has happened. I took it to get serviced at my local jeep Chrysler dodge dealership and I am still receiving the same issue.
Recently, my daughter experienced the vehicle shaking after traveling on the beltway at the speed of 65+ MPH.  She informed that she hit a pothole in the road at the high speed and the car began to shake.  The history of this vehicle when I leased it new was the same.  After having leased the vehicle for less than a year, I experienced the same.  At that time there was a recall on the steering stabilizer (believe that was the name).  I took it back to the dealership and it appeared to be resolved.  I had not experienced the problem again until recently.  I just took it to the dealership explaining the problem.  They informed me that the steering damper design was outdated and performed a bleed out.  After driving the vehicle, I experienced the same problem (traveling @ a speed of 65+ and hit an imperfection in the road).  I believe that may daughter or I could lose control of the vehicle if traveling on the beltway and the vehicle shakes uncontrollably; thus, there's a lost of control of the vehicle which will cause a crash.
1. Engine  2. Yes. I was on a major highway when the Jeep wouldn't go above 10 miles per hour and almost causing me to get rear ended. 3. I had it at the dealer at least 4 times, they can't find the problem. They replaced ABS controller, still they can't find the problem. 4. The vehicle was inspected by the dealer, not even sure how it passed state inspection. 5. Every warning light came up on the dashboard. The problem started in November 2021. The last incident happened on the night of 2/19, this time the vehicle would go pass first gear...I was driving 10mph.
I have a experienced steering lockup multiple times. Normally in cold weather conditions. Twice in the driveway. About 5-6 times on the road at 30-40 mph and twice on the interstate
The Uconnect (Infotainment System) screen in our vehicle has suffered from delamination. The delamination between the two parts of the screen has resulted in persistent "ghost touching". This is where the screen acts as if it has been touched even though it has not. This ghost touching is sporadic and volatile and results in a very large distraction for the driver. On more than one instance this distraction has almost led to a collision. At one point the touch screen started to self dial SOS and would not respond to the initial attempts to hang up, causing the driver to be distracted and almost cause a collision.   This is a known problem affecting multiple FCA vehicles where they have chosen to not recall or support the replacement of the faulty part. This issue can endanger the vehicle driver and others on the road way.
The contact owns a 2018 Jeep Wrangler. The contact stated while driving approximately 50 mph, the clutch ceased. The vehicle was towed to the local dealer and was diagnosed that the pressure plate overheated and caused damage to the flywheel. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The contact received notification of NHTSA campaign number: 21V028000 (Power Train) however, the part to do the recall repair was unavailable. The failure mileage was approximately 47,000.

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2018 JEEP WRANGLER. THE CONTACT STATED WHILE DRIVING 25-35 MPH, THE VEHICLE SEIZED AND STOPPED. THERE WERE NO WARNING LIGHTS ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO GULF CHRYSLER DODGE JEEP (3781 S MCKENZIE ST, FOLEY, AL 36535, (251) 943-5075) TO BE DIAGNOSED. THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED THAT THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL HAD LOCKED UP. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS CONTACTED AND INFORMED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 23,000.
FOR SOME REASON WHEN DRIVING OVER 60MPH AND UNDER 40 DEGREES OUTSIDE, THE STEERING WHEEL STICKS OR BECOMES VERY STIFF WHEN ATTEMPTING TO TURNING RIGHT DURING A CURVE IN THE ROAD OR WHEN CHANGING LANES.  THE DANGER IS THAT IT WILL THEN SUDDENLY UN-STICK AND CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO SWERVE TO THE RIGHT.  THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED WAS IN 2018.  THERE WAS A DEALER SOFTWARE PROGRAMING UPDATE THAT WAS PERFORMED HOWEVER EACH WINTER WHEN THE TEMPERATURE DROPS BELOW 40 THE ISSUE STILL OCCURS.
WHILE DRIVING ON HIGHWAY THE STEERING WHEEL BECAME STIFF FOR ABOUT A COUPLE OF SECONDS,WHEN IT GOT BACK TO NORMAL IT CORRECTED INTO INCOMING TRAFFIC, I NEARLY HIT INCOMING TRAFFIC,IT WAS PRETTY SCARY CAUSE THE STEERING WAS VERY HARD AND STIFF , I WAS TRYING TO CORRECT THE VEHICLE CAUSE IT WAS MOVING TOWARDS THE LEFT EVEN THOUGH I WAS TRYING TO CORRECT IT TO THE RIGHT, WHEN IT LOOSENED UP IT JERKED HARD TO THE LEFT TO INCOMING TRAFFIC,THANKFULLY THERE WAS NO INCOMING TRAFFIC AT THE TIME, ALSO I NOTICED THAT WHEN I PUT THE TRANSMISSION IN GEAR THERE'S NO MOVEMENT, IT ACTS LIKE IT'S IN NEUTRAL, I HAVE TO PUT IT BACK IN PARK AND RESHIFT
TRAVELING WEST ON I 40 IN WILMINGTON NC APPROX 70 MPH WHEN VEHICLE BEGAN TO SUDDENLY SHAKE VIOLENTLY FOR NO APPARENT REASON. MY WIFE BECAME SO SCARED AS SHE DROVE, WE HAD TO PULL OVER AND I HAD TO TAKE OVER DRIVING. SHE WILL NOT DRIVE THIS JEEP AGAIN. I'VE NEVER SEEN A VEHICLE SHAKE SO VIOLENTLY AS IF THE ENTIRE FRONT END WAS ABOUT TO FALL OUT FROM UNDER THE CAR ANY SECOND. NOT A SAFETY ISSUE, I THINK IT DEFINITELY IS A SAFETY ISSUE. 3 LANE HIGHWAY, 70 MPH, CARS ON EVERY SIDE OF YOU AND YOU HAVE TO SLAM ON BRAKES, OR THE INSTINCT IS TO SLAM ON BRAKES BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO DIE OR NOT. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS FRONT END ISSUE WITH JEEP WRANGLER.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2018 JEEP WRANGLER. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS AT A STAND STILL, WHEN THE REAR PASSENGER SEAT FAILED TO RELEASE AND THE PLASTIC ADJUSTER DISINTEGRATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE LOCAL DEALER ZAPPONE CHRYSLER JEEP DODGE RAM CLIFTON PARK LOCATED AT 1780 AL-9, CLIFTON PARK, NY 12065, (518) 383-2277, WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED WITH NEEDING THE REAR SEAT RELEASE ASSEMBLY TO BE REPLACED. THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED THAT THE PARTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER HAD NOT BEEN INFORMED OF FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 12,000.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2018 JEEP WRANGLER. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE FRAME WELDS ON THE VEHICLE WAS RUSTED THROUGHOUT THE SUBFRAME OF THE VEHICLE. ADDITIONALLY, SOME WELDS WERE NOT COMPLETED AND NOT CONNECTED TO THE JOINTS. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO JOHNSON DODGE CHRYSLER JEEP RAM DEALER (481 US-46, BUDD LAKE, NJ 07828), AND AN INSPECTED. THE MECHANIC INFORMED THE CONTACT THAT THERE WAS NO ISSUES WITH THE VEHICLE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE WARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 41,000.
VEHICLE IS UNDER RECALL W12/NHTSA 20V-124. FIAT/CHRYSLER (FCA) HAS BEEN STALLING US FOR QUITE A LONG TIME. THE CLUTCH PRESSURE PLATE MAY BECOME OVERHEATED AND FRACTURE THE TRANSMISSION, WHICH CAN RESULT IN PERSONAL INJURY, OR THE CAR GETTING FIRE.THE DEALER SAYS THAT CHRYSLER DOESN'T HAVE THE PART REQUIRED TO FIX THE CAR, AND FCA KEEPS ROUTING ME FROM ONE REPRESENTATIVE TO ANOTHER, BUT THEY WON'T EVEN SAY IF THEY HAVE THE PART. I HAVE BEEN MAKING PAYMENTS DILIGENTLY ON A CAR THAT CANNOT BE DRIVEN, AS THE STATEMENT ON THEIR OWN LETTER INFORMS THAT THE RECALL PERTAINS TO A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. MY CAR HAS BEEN TO THE DEALER AND DEEMED THAT THERE IS A LEAK AND THE CLUTCH HOSE SO I SHOULDN'T DRIVE IT. THE CLUTCH ALREADY FEELS EXTREMELY SOFT AND I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE IT. FCA DOES IS NOT OFFERING ANY HOPES OF FIXING NOR IS PROVIDING ANY INFORMATION REGARDING A TIMELINE.  *TR
LOOSE STEERING AND WANDERS
THERE HAVE BEEN THREE SEPARATE EVENTS THAT OCCURED RELATED TO THE FRONT STEERING SHAKING ON THE VEHICLE. TWO OCCURRED BEFORE I HAD THE RECALL DONE CALLED 02V41182 STEERING DAMPER. DRIVING ~60 MPH, ~30 DEGREES F, AND AFTER HITTING A BUMP. I THEN TOOK IT IN FOR SERVICE FOR THE WORK COVERED UNDER THE STEERING DAMPENER TO BE FIXED. APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES AFTER LEAVING THE DEALER, I WAS DRIVING AND THE ISSUE OCCURRED AGAIN FOR THE THIRD TIME. I AM SCARED FOR THE SAFETY OF MY LIFE AND INTEGRITY OF THE STEERING SYSTEM AS ALL THREE EVENTS OCCURRED ON THE THE HIGHWAY.
VEHICLE WANDERS AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND IS VERY HARD TO KEEP IN LANE CONSTANTLY MAKING SMALL ADJUSTMENTS TO KEEP IT BETWEEN WHITE LINES.ANY WIND MAGNIFIES THE PROBLEM. DEALER INSTALLED NEW STEERING STABILIZER AND FLASHED POWER STEERING CPU.HELPED A LITTLE FOR A WHILE.HAVE READ BLOGS AND CHECKED ALIGNMENT CHAMBER AIR PRESSURE ETC.NOTING SEEMS TO HELP. SEEMS TO ME THE POWER STEERING IS WAY TO SENSITIVE WHEN DRIVING STRAIGHT .MY WIFE WON'T DRIVE IT AND WHEN I DRIVE I HAVE TO FOCUS WITHOUT DISTRACTIONS TO KEEP IT ON THE ROAD. VERY DANGEROUS TO BE ON THE ROAD .WOULD LIKE A CASE NUMBER  TO SEE IF I CAN THE THE PROBLEM RESOLVED
I HAVE A 2018 JEEP WRANGLER JLU SAHARA WITH 4,186 MILES ON IT. I AM EXPERIENCING VERY LOOSE STEERING ON MY VEHICLE. THE STEERING WHEEL HAS A DEAD SPOT OF ABOUT 2 INCHES IN EITHER DIRECTION FROM CENTER.THIS BECOMES INCREASINGLY NOTICEABLE AS SPEED INCREASES AND ONCE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS IS EXTREMELY UNSTABLE. AS TO GET THE VEHICLE TO RESPOND / MAKE EVEN MINOR STEERING ADJUSTMENT AS YOU DRIVE, TAKES A SUBSTANTIAL MOVEMENT OF THE STEERING WHEEL. THIS LEADS TO THE VEHICLE SWERVING ALL OVER THE ROAD AND IS IS REALLY HARD TO CONTROL. IT IS TRULY NOT SAFE, ESPECIALLY HIGHER SPEEDS. AFTER I PURCHASES THE VEHICLE AND EXPERIENCED MY ISSUE, I HAVE COME TO LEARN THAT IS IT A VERY WELL KNOWN WIDE SPREAD PROBLEM THAT IS GOING UNADDRESSED BY FCA (FIAT CHRYSLER AUTOMOBILES) AND IS BEING EVEN MORE IGNORED BY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENTS OF MOST OF THEIR DEALERSHIPS (VERY FRUSTRATING TO BE TOLD THERE IS NO ISSUES WHEN EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THERE IS). THIS TOPIC IS ALL OVER INTERNET FORUMS, ON LINE ARTICLE AND ON LINE VIDEOS OUTLINING THE SAME EXPERIENCE AND OUTRAGED BECAUSE NO ONE IS ACKNOWLEDGING THIS DANGEROUS ISSUE.
I HAVE HAD THE STEERING DAMPENER REPLACED 3 TIMES, AND THE FIX HAS NOT CORRECTED THE SHIMMY IN THE STEERING ON THE HIGHWAY. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS WHEN IT HAPPENS, AS I HAVE TO SLOW DOWN COMPLETELY ON THE INTERSTATE.
BOUGHT THE VEHICLE MAY 2018.  AFTER DRIVING FOR A WEEK BROUGHT BACK TO DEALER IN REGARDS TO LOOSE STEERING AND A DEAD SPOT THAT I COULD MOVE THE WHEEL 3 INCHES BEFORE THE TIRES WOULD MOVE.   DEALER SAID IT WAS A JEEP THING.   THIS IS MY 4TH JEEP WRANGLER AND NONE OF MY PREVIOUS MODELS HAD THE ISSUE.  THEY SAID IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE THAT WAY.   AFTER ANOTHER MONTH I BROUGHT IT BACK COMPLAINING OF THE SAME PROBLEM AND THAT I SAW FORUMS THAT STATED OTHERS WERE HAVING ISSUES.  ONCE AGAIN, TOLD IT IS THE WAY THAT JEEPS HANDLE.  I TOOK THE JEEP TO A 4 WHEEL DRIVE PLACE FOR AN ALIGNMENT.  AFTER ALIGNMENT THE VEHICLE HAD THE SAME ISSUE.    I HAVE SINCE PUT ON LEVELING KIT AND 35 INCH TIRES.  WHEN I BROUGHT IT BACK TO JEEP BECAUSE I HEARD OF A SOFTWARE PATCH AND NEW STEERING BOX THAT WAS SUPPOSE TO FIX STEERING.  DEALER SAID THAT BECAUSE I PUT ON 35 INCH TIRES THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.  I NOW HAVE 27K MISERABLE AND DANGEROUS MILES ON THE VEHICLE.    I SEE THAT JEEP JL AS ALMOST 1K OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE STEERING.  IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE WHEN YOU CANT KEEP IN YOUR LANE!
JUST GOT ONTO HIGHWAY, GOING ABOUT 72 MPH, HIT A SMALL BUMP AND CAR STARTED VIOLENTLY SHAKING (FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO AS DEATH WOBBLE). ONCE I PULLED OVER AND STOPPED THE WOBBLE WENT AWAY. THIS HAPPENED THE DAY AFTER I BROUGHT MY VEHICLE IN FOR A RECALL TO REPLACE THE STEERING COLUMN DAMPER WHICH SUPPOSEDLY CAUSED THIS PROBLEM TO BEGIN WITH. NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM UNTIL I BROUGHT IT IN FOR THE RECALL. BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALERSHIP TWO DAYS LATER AND THEY TOLD ME NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH IT BUT IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN TO BRING IT BACK IN. THEY TOLD ME MY WHEELS WERE SLIGHTLY OUT OF ALIGNMENT WHICH MAY HAVE CAUSED IT BUT THERE IS NO WAY; THE VEHICLE WAS SHAKING VIOLENTLY BACK AND FORTH, IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH A SLIGHTLY OFF ALIGNMENT.
WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE GOES ALL OVER THE PLACES AND ITS HARD TO DRIVE IN  ONE LANE. THE STEERING IS VERY LOSE TO DRIVE THEN OTHER JEEPS. ITS UNSAFE. I HAVE BEEN CONTACTING JEEP SO MANY TIMES BUT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIX IT OR DID THE RECENT RECALL.
VIOLENT SHAKING OF THE FRONT END AFTER HITTING A BUMP AT APPROXIMATELY 65-75 MPH. SHAKING WILL ONLY STOP AFTER COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP. ONLY 4000 MILES ON THIS VEHICLE.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2018 JEEP WRANGLER. WHILE DRIVING 70 MPH OVER A BUMP IN THE ROAD, THE VEHICLE WOBBLED UNCONTROLLABLY. THE DRIVER HAD TO REDUCE THE SPEED TO 50 MPH TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT TAKEN TO THE DEALER FOR DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 35,408.
VEHICLE HAS PLAY IN THE STEERING AT ALL SPEEDS.
MY BRAND NEW, 2018 JEEP HAS 768 MILES ON IT AND THE STEERING IS LOOSE TO SAY THE LEAST.  IF THE FRONT TRACK BAR BRACKET (SOLID FRONT AXLE IN LINE WITH THE BODY OF THE VEHICLE) STILL HAS WELDS THAT ARE OFF SEAM, CAN CAUSE THE BRACKET TO DETACH FROM THE FRAME AND CAN CAUSE  LOOSE, VAGUE STEERING TO A COMPLETE SYSTEM FAILURE.     RECALL STATEMENT:   "THE SEPARATION OF THE FRONT TRACK BAR BRACKET FROM THE FRAME MAY CAUSE A REDUCTION IN THE STEERING RESPONSE, WHICH CAN CAUSE A VEHICLE CRASH WITHOUT PRIOR WARNING,"    THIS IS MY THIRD JEEP AND 2ND JEEP WRANGLER. THE DEALERSHIP STATES THEY REPAIRED THE RECALL, 2 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE PURCHASE DATE,  BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE THEY DID.  IF THE DEALERSHIP CLAIMED THE REPAIR TO JEEP I AM SURE THEY POCKETED THE MONEY.  THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY RISK AS THE STEERING IS RECALLED AS A SAFETY RECALL - THE DEALERSHIP SHOULD BE LIABLE AND JEEP NEEDS TO INSPECT THAT THE RECALLS AT THE VERY LEAST ONE AND THOSE THAT CLAIM TO DO THE REPAIRS AND DO NOT - SHOULD HAVE THEIR ABILITY TO OFFER JEEP PRODUCTS REVOKED.
OCCASIONALLY WHEN I TURN, THE CAR WILL SWERVE. THERE WAS A STEERING RECALL IN JUNE. WHEN I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP, THEY DISAGREED MY ISSUE. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN THE CAR.
THE VEHICLE IS DIFFICULT TO STEER, ESPECIALLY AT SPEEDS 45 MILES PER HOUR AND UP. THE VEHICLE HAS PLAY IN THE STEERING WHEEL AND TENDS TO WANDER ON THE ROAD AND IS VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL WHEN DRIVING ON A STRAIGHTAWAY. PROBLEM IS WORSE AT FREEWAY SPEEDS.  IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS. FCA HAS BEEN NO HELP.
MY CAR HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING THE 'DEATH WOBBLE' AS SOME DEALERSHIPS HAVE TOLD ME THAT. THE STEERING GETS A MIND OF ITS OWN AND ITS SUPER HARD TO CONTROL SOMETIMES. I PURCHASED A BRAND NEW CAR AND IT FEELS LIKE IM DRIVING A LEMON. ALMOST EVERY OTHER DAY SINCE I PURCHASED IT (ONE MONTH AGO) SEEMS LIKE IVE ALMOST GOTTEN INTO AN ACCIDENT.
HAVE HAD MY JEEP SERVICED TWICE FOR IT WANDERING ALL OVER THE ROAD FOR LITTLE TO ZERO IMPROVEMENT. I RECENTLY TOOK A 6.5 HOUR HIGHWAY TRIP AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC ALL OVER THE ROAD VERY UNSAFE AND THERE WAS LITTLE WIND AND DRY ROADS SO WEATHER WAS NOT THE CAUSE. CAN NOT STAY STRAIGHT CONSTANTLY MAKING ADJUSTMENTS WHEN YOU SHOULD BE GOING STRAIGHT. IT IS ALL THE TIME IN TOWN AND HIGHWAY BUT HIGHWAY DRIVING IS AMPLIFIED THE EFFECTS. I FEEL IT IS UNSAFE AND WE HAD IT PARKED FOR ABOUT 40 DAYS NOT USING IT BECAUSE MY FIANCE AND I FEEL IT'S U SAFE. AFTER THE MOST RECENT SERVICE STILL ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE IN FACT THE HIGHWAY DRIVING IS MUCH WORSE.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2018 JEEP WRANGLER. UPON RESEARCHING THE NHTSA.GOV WEBSITE, THE CONTACT NOTICED NHTSA ACTION NUMBER: DP18004. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE FRAME WELD HAD POROSITY SPOTS AND DISCOLORATION AND WAS EXPERIENCING THE SAME FAILURES LISTED IN THE ACTION NUMBER. THE CONTACT CALLED PREMIER CHRYSLER DODGE JEEP RAM OF BUENA PARK (LOCATED AT 7301 ARTESIA BLVD, BUENA PARK, CA 90621) AND NOTIFIED THEM OF THE FAILURE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 20,000.
VEHICLE WON'T START. ISSUE STARTED ON 5/6/2019 WHEN I GET TO MY WORK PARK THE CAR AND AT THE TIME TO GO HOME CAR DIDN'T START. VEHICLE WAS COMPLETELY STOPPED WITH TRANSMISSION IN P, DOORS CLOSED, PUSHED THE BRAKE PEDAL AND THE START BUTTON AND NOT START. ALL DASHBOARD LIGHTS ARE ON I'M ABLE TO TURN THE LIGHTS ON, FOG LIGHTS AND STEREO. I HAVE REPLACED THE BATTERY OF THE KEY TO ELIMINATE THAT VARIABLE IT DIDN'T WORK. TRIED TO START IT WITH THE NOSE OF THE KEY AT THE START BUTTON, NOT WORK. I LEFT THE VEHICLE AND DRIVE AWAY FROM IT LIKE 1-MILE DISTANCE CAME BACK AND THE VEHICLE STARTED. THIS ISSUE KEEPS HAPPENING EVERY SINGLE DAY, IN THE MORNING, AFTER WORK, ANY TIME. AND TODAY 5/9/19 THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT TURNED ON. VEHICLE WON'T START RANDOMLY. NEED A SOLUTION ASAP.
VEHICLE SHAKES UNCONTROLLABLY WHEN HITTING A BUMP AT SPEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY 50MPH OR HIGHER. IT FEELS AS IF YOU'VE POPPED A TIRE. SHAKING WILL NOT STOP UNTIL YOU SLOW DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY. THIS ISSUE IS OFTEN CALLED THE 'DEATH WOBBLE.' NO MODIFICATIONS TO THE VEHICLE, LESS THAN 7 MONTHS OLD AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST INCIDENT. CONSISTENTLY HAPPENS AT LEAST ONCE EVERY OTHER WEEK.
TRYING TO AVOID A LARGE DIRT CLUMP LEFT IN THE ROAD BY THE ROAD MAINTENENCE CREW I SWERVED TO THE LEFT AT 35 MILES AN HOUR AND THE ESM/ESC LIGHT CAME ON AND THE JEEP TOOK OVER THE CAR I COULD NOT APPLY THE BRAKES OR CONTROL THE STEERING THE SPEED DID NOT DEMINISH AND THE VEHICLE CROSSED AN INTERSECTION ROLLING UP AN EMBANKMENT SO THAT THE FRONT OF THE JEEP WENT IN THE AIR AND CAME DOWN HARD CAUSING THE FRAME TO BREAK AND THE FRONT AXLE TO BEND. IF I COULD HAVE AT LEAST BEEN ABLE TO CONTROL THE STEERING I COULD HAVE TURNED IN THE DIRECTION I HAD INTENDED TO GO THIS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. JEEP IS NOW TRYING TO FIX THE CONTROL SYSTEM AFTER THE DAMAGE WAS REPAIRED. THE LIGHT REMAINED ON EVEN AFTER THE JEEP STOPPED. I SEE OTHERS HAVE HAD TROUBLE WITH THIS SYSTEM. I HAD A 2012 RUBICON THAT HAD TROUBLE WITH THIS SYSTEM AND TOOK IT TO THE DEALER NUMEROUS TIMES AND THEY COULD NOT FIND THE PROBLEM SO I TRADED OFF FOR ANOTHER VEHICLE. THIS ALSO CAUSE ME A BROKEN BACK. THE SEAT BELT WAS DEPLOYED AND THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.I WAS ON A COUNTY ROAD AND WAS GOING TO TURN LEFT ONTO ANOTHER COUNTY ROAD BUT COULD NOT TURN THE WHEEL.THESE ROADS ARE DIRT AND WERE JUST GRADED LEAVING LOOSE DIRT AND ICE WHICH WERE NOT THERE WHEN I HAD TRAVELED THIS ROAD ABOUT 2 HOURS EARLIER. I WAS IN TWO WHEEL DRIVE AND HAVE FOUNT BLOGS WHERE OTHERS HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM AND THAT YOU SHOULD TURN THE SYSTEM OFF ON DIRT ROADS.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2018 JEEP WRANGLER. WHILE DRIVING HIGH SPEEDS, THE VEHICLE VIOLENTLY VIBRATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO PREFERRED CHRYSLER DODGE JEEP RAM OF MUSKEGON (3146 HENRY ST, MUSKEGON, MI 49441, (877) 565-0628), BUT THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE AND INFORMED THE CONTACT THAT THE DAMPER NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 57,000.
THERE IS A LOT OF PLAY IN THE STEERING AT NORMAL SPEEDS.  ALSO WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD MINOR BUMPS MAKE THE CAR JART IN EITHER DIRECTION AND WHEN LARGER BUMPS ARE HIT THE VEHICLES STEERING WHEEL SHAKES VIOLENTLY BACK AND FOURTH UNTIL I SLOW DOWN. MY WIFE STATED THAT SHE LOOKED IN HER REARVIEW MIRROR AS I WAS FOLLOWING HE AND SHE SAID IT LOOKED LIKE THE WHEELS WERE WOBBLING . THE CAR IS CURRENTLY IN THE SHOP WAITING TO BE REPAIRED.  THEY SAID THE STEERING DAMPNER NEEDED REPLACE, BUT FROM WHAT I READ THAT WILL JUST MASK THE PROBLEM FOR NOW
STEERING WHEEL HAS EXCESS PLAY, WANDERS AROUND THE HIGHWAY WENT AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, ESPECIALLY IN TURNS.
GOING APPROXIMATELY 70 MPH ON THE FREEWAY MY JEEP VERY SUDDENLY BEGAN TO SHAKE/VIBRATE VERY VIOLENTLY. EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN CONTROL. FELT LIKE THE CAR WAS GOING TO COME APART/TIRES WERE GOING TO FALL OFF. AFTER SLOWING DOWN TO MAYBE 30 MPH THE SHAKING RESOLVED. JEEP HAS APPROXIMATELY 5800 MILES ON IT.
POWER STEERING STOPPED WORKING WHEN DRIVING ON HIGHWAY.  ONLY CAN STEERING 10 DEGREES EITHER RIGHT OR LEFT. THANK GOD, I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER.  I RESTARTED AND STEERING CANE BACK.
WHEN DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS MY STEERING HAS LOCKED UP OR BECOME DIFFICULT TO TURN.  IT BECOMES VERY STIFF AND VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL.  THE LAST TIME IT LOCKED UP IT "BROKE LOOSE" WHILE TRYING TO FORCE IT TO MAINTAIN THE LANE AND I ALMOST OVER CORRECTED INTO THE TURN AT 60MPH.
JEEP WAS RECALLED IN OCTOBER OVER A TRACK BAR WELD ISSUE WHERE SOME VEHICLES WE IMPROPERLY WELDED. MINE HAD TO GO TO THE DEALER 3X AS THE DEALER WAS UNSURE WHAT TO DO. WAS TOLD IT WAS FINE. JUST RECEIVED ANOTHER RECALL THAT THE RECALL MAY NOT HAVE BEEN DONE PROPERLY AND WILL NEED TO BE REINSPECTED. I HAVE 0 FAITH IN THE SAFETY OF THIS JEEP.
VIOLENT STEERING WOBBLE OCCURS AFTER TRAVELING OVER UNEVEN ROAD SURFACES AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, MAKING THE VEHICLE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL.  VEHICLE IS A STOCK JL WRANGLER UNLIMITED SAHARA WITH LESS THAN 10,000 MILES.    THE CONDITION HAS OCCURRED SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS NEW, AND A SIMPLE BUMP, BRIDGE JOINT OR POT HOLE CAN SET THE VEHICLE INTO A DEATH WOBBLE AT SPEEDS ABOVE 60 MPH.
WHEN CAR IS DRIVEN ON HIGHWAY 60 M/H AND ABOVE, WHEN YOU HIT A POT HOLE OR MANHOLE, EXPERIENCE VIOLENT STEERING WHEEL/FRONT END VIBRATION 'DEAT WOBBLE'. IT'S STARTED WITH ONLE 5000 MILES ON A CAR.
BACKUP CAMERA GUIDELINES HAVE DISAPPEARED AND THE SCREEN GOES BLACK AT TIMES
STEERING AND CONTROL DRASTICALLY IMPAIRED WHEN HITTING A BUMP OVER 50 MPH. CAR AND STEERING WHEEL VIOLENTLY SHAKE AND CAUSES ME TO LOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. CAR IS STOCK WITH 0 MODIFICATIONS AND LESS THAT 700 MILES ON IT. WHOEVER SAYS THIS IS NOT A SAFETY CONCERN IS WRONG. I NEARLY CRASHED ON THE HIGHWAY GOING 55 MPH. FAMILY WILL NOT DRIVE WITH ME IN THE CAR ANYMORE DUE TO ISSUE. THIS IS A BRAND NEW CAR. HOW CAN THIS BE JUSTIFIED?
HIT A BUMP ON THE INTERSTATE CAUSING THE STEERING AND VEHICLE TO SHAKE UNCONTROLLABLY.  THIS ONLY STOPPED WHEN SLOWING DOWN TO APPROX 45 MPH.  THIS STARTED AT APPROX 60-65 MPH.
CLICKING NOISE FROM FRONT DRIVERS SIDE WHEN TURNING AT LOW SPEEDS. BALL JOINT RETAINER BOLTS OUT OF TORQUE SPEC FROM FACTORY.
THERE IS A DEAD SPOT IN THE STEERING AT CENTER . WHEN I'M DRIVING I HAVE TO CONSTANTLY CORRECT THE STEERING TO MAKE IT GO STRAIGHT . THE PROBLEM GETS WORSE AT HIGHER SPEEDS . THE VEHICLE WONDERS AND I'M SURE IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A DRUNK DRIVER BEHIND THE WHEEL . I CAN MOVE THE STEERING WHEEL 15 DEGREES  BACK AND FORTH IN EITHER DIRECTION WHILE DRIVING AND NOT GET A RESPONSE FROM THE STEERING . THAT'S THE DEAD SPOT .  THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO KEEP THE VEHICLE IN A LANE .
DRIVING ON HIGHWAY AT APPROXIMATELY 70-75 MPH AND THE FRONT END STARTED TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY.  STEERING WHEEL AND FRONT END WERE VISIBLY SHAKING.  HAD TO PULL TO SIDE OF ROAD.  TOOK TO DEALERSHIP THE NEXT DAY IN WHICH THEY STATED IT WAS THE "DEATH WOBBLE".  PARTS NOT AVAILABLE TO FIX FOR 5-6 MORE MONTHS (APRIL - MAY 2019).  COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE CONSIDERING IT'S BRAND NEW, I COMMUTE 5 DAYS A WEEK (120 HIGHWAY MILES A DAY) AND ALSO TRANSPORT TWO SMALL CHILDREN TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY.  I ALSO SUFFER FROM PANIC ATTACKS, IN WHICH THIS INCIDENT BROUGHT ON A FULL BLOWN ATTACK.  I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT MY SAFETY IN THIS VEHICLE.
AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS OVER 55MPH, UPON HITTING A SLIGHT BUMP OR IMPERFECTION IN THE ROAD THE STEERING WOBBLES VIOLENTLY. THIS IS ONLY CORRECTED BY SLOWING DOWN. THIS CAN BE A PROBLEM ON A INTERSTATE HIGHWAY.
THE STEERING SEEMS TO CATCH IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS WHEN DRIVING AND SLIGHTING TURNING TO THE RIGHT, IT GETS VERY STIFF AS IF THE POWER STEERING HAS GONE OUT, THEN RELEASES  IT HAPPENS EVERY MORNING WHEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE..
WHEN TRAVELING ON THE HIGHWAY OVER 70MPH I HIT A SMALL BUMP AND MY STEERING WHEEL BEGAN TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY AND UNCONTROLLABLY. IT FORCED ME TO SLOW DOWN UNTIL THE SHAKING STOPPED.
WHILE IN MOTION ON THE HIGHWAY, A VIOLENT SHAKING OCCURS ON THE STOCK JEEP WRANGLER UNLIMITED ALL NEW JL 2018 WITH MINIMAL TRANSITION FROM PAVEMENT TO A DIFFERENT PAVEMENT OR BRIDGE TRANSITION.  VIOLENT SHAKING IN THE STEERING WHEEL AND WHEELS LASTS FOR 15-20 SECONDS WHILE TRAVELING THE DISTANCE OF A FOOTBALL FIELD OR MORE.  VERY HARD TO KEEP CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE AND NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL CATASTROPHIC ACCIDENT.  SAME ISSUE AS PRIOR JK MODEL COMPLAINTS OF THE 'DEATH WOBBLE'.  THIS HAS OCCURRED 3 TIMES WITH UNDER 5,000 MILES ON THIS BRAND NEW VEHICLE.  NO MODIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN DONE TO THE JEEP.  TIE ROD IN FRONT CONNECTED TO THE RIGHT PASSENGER SIDE WHEEL HAS A SLIGHT BACK AND FORTH MOVEMENT WHEN MOVED BY HAND WHILE WHEELS ARE ALIGNED STRAIGHT FORWARD IN THE PARKED POSITION.  OTHER SIDE DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME GIVE WHEN I TRIED TO SEE IF IT WOULD MOVE.  ANOTHER PERSON ON THE JEEP WRANGLER FORUM ONLINE IS EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM AT ABOUT THE SAME MILEAGE ON THE JL.
AT ABOUT 2400 MILES MY UNLIMITED SAHARA HAS BEGUN DOING THE JEEP DEATH WOBBLE WHEN SPEEDS ARE OVER 50 MPH AND A SMALL BUMP IS HIT   I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALERSHIP TWICE AND THEY TOLD ME IT IS SAFE TO DRIVE AND THEY REPLACED THE STEERING DAMPER.   THE PROBLEM IS STILL HAPPENING AND THERE IS SO MUCH PLAY IN THE STEERING WHEEL THAT I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING MY BRAND NEW JEEP ... IT IS ALL OVER THE ROAD AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS REQUIRES CONSTANT CORRECTION IN STEERING   WHEN A SMALL BUMP IS HIT ON SIDE ROADS AT LOW SPEEDS CAR FEELS LIKE IT IS GOING TO FALL APART   I HAVE OWNED WRANGLERS IN THE PAST AND HAVE NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN AND NEVER FELT UNSAFE *DT *JB
THE STEERING HAS A DEAD SPOT IN THE CENTER WHICH CAUSES WANDERING IN THE LANE AND OVER CORRECTION AT 40 MPH AND UP TO HIGHWAY SPEEDS. THIS CAUSES UNSAFE LANE KEEPING ON COUNTRY ROADS AS WELL AS HIGHWAY AND INTERSTATE TRAVEL. BOTH MY WIFE AND I HAVE NEARLY SIDE SWIPED VEHICLES AND CLOSE CALLS IN ONCOMING TRAFFIC. THE DEALER IN MY LOCATION SAYS IT'S NORMAL BEHAVIOR BUT THE ABILITY TO STAY IN MY LANE IS NOT SAFE IN ANY WAY.
AS DRIVING MY NEW JEEP I NOTICE I WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THE HANDLING .STEERING THE JEEP, TO MUCH PLAY ON STEERING, KIND OF A BIG TURN OFF COMING OFF.SPECIALLY ON THE MAINE HIGHWAYS WITH EXTRA PEOPLE IN THE CAR
POOR FRAME WELDS AT CRITICAL POINTS. I HAVE WELDS THAT YOU CAN STICK YOUR FINGER NAILS BEHIND. HAVE POOR WELD AT TRACK BAR AND SHOCK MOUNTS. SLAG AND POOR PENETRATION. HAVE SPOTS WHERE BURN THROUGH OCCURS AND RUSTS. VEHICLE CLICKS AND POPS DURING TURNS. STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY IS COMPROMISED..
MOST RECENT INCIDENT:  SUNDAY NEAR FRANKFURT AIRPORT THE  ERROR CODE READ " SERVICE SHIFTER" AND THE ORANGE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON WHILE DRIVING.  I DROVE INTO THE CAR PARK THEN TRIED TO SHIFT FROM DRIVE TO PARK AND THE JEEP LOCKED IN NEUTRAL. THE JEEP LOCKED UP AS IF IT WAS IN PARK SO WE COULD NOT PUSH OR PULL THE VEHICLE. I ALSO COULD NOT TURN THE VEHICLE OFF COMPLETELY.  THE INTERIOR LIGHTS WERE ON AND I COULD NOT TURN THEM OFF VIA THE IGNITION. THIS IS WHY THE BATTERY WAS DRAINED.  THE CAR SAT SINCE SUNDAY ON UNTIL IT WAS TOWED AND YOUR STAFF WAS ABLE TO LOOK AT IT.  PICTURES WILL FOLLOW IN THE NEXT EMAIL.  PLEASE PULL ENTIRE DIAGNOSTIC HISTORY IF POSSIBLE.    FIRST INCIDENT:  VEHICLE DID THE SAME THING ON VOGELWEH AIR FORCE BASE.  IT WAS TOWED TO MUM MATTUSCH.  WHEN THEY LOOKED AT IT THE DIAGNOSIS WAS LOW BATTERY.  IT WAS EXPLAINED THE DRAW ON THE BATTERY BY THE VEHICLE BUT SHOWED NO ISSUE AS THE VEHICLE WAS DRAINED AND UPON CHARGING THE BATTERY THAT MUST REBOOT THE ERROR CODE.
WHILE THIS VEHICLE WAS PARKED IN A PARKING LOT, AND OFF  IT EXPLODED INTO FLAMES.  .. *BF    CONSUMER STATED CAR WAS PARKED AROUND 9PM AND NOTICED THE FIRE AROUND 3:00AM, SO ABOUT 6 HOURS. POLICE AND FIRE CREW CONCLUDED THAT THE FIRE STARTED FROM FAULTY WIRING. UPDATED 10/30/18*JB *DT*JB
NEW 2018 JEEP WRANGLER SAHARA JL EXPERIENCING INSTABILITY WITH THE STEERING. AT SPEEDS ABOVE 40MPH THE VEHICLES STEERING REQUIRES CONSTANT COMPENSATION TO KEEP IT TRACKING STRAIGHT. IT IS VERY CONCERNING ON NARROWERE, OLDER HIGHWAYS WHERE A SMALL ADJUSTMENTS MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE. THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS REGARDING THIS VEHICLES' STEERING AND IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE MANUFACTURER. THE JEEP IS GOING TO THE DEALERSHIP THIS WEEK AND MY EXPECTATIONS THAT THE ISSUE WILL BE ADDRESSED IS VERY LOW.
STEERING VERY LOOSE AND WANDERS ALL OVER THE ROAD.  YOU NEED TO CONSTANTLY MAKE CORRECTIONS WHILE STEERING.  SEEMS LIKE THE JEEP WANTS TO WANDER AND IS VERY HARD TO CONTROL.  IVE ONLY HAD THE JEEP FOR A WEEK.
VEHICLE STALLED IN HIGHWAY, STOP AND GO TRAFFIC FOR NO REASON AND WAS EXTREMELY HARD TO RESTART.  A FEW DAYS LATER, THE RADIO AND BACKUP CAMERA WENT OUT AND CAME BACK AN HOUR OR SO LATER.  THE RADIO, WHICH CONTROLS ALL ELECTRONICS AND BACKUP CAMERA, WENT OUT AGAIN. DEALER REPLACED SOME SORT OF INTERFACE FOR THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM (RADIO) ON 07/30/18.  THEN VEHICLE STALLED AGAIN IN HIGHWAY, STOP AND GO TRAFFIC ON 08/03/2018 AND WAS DIFFICULT TO RESTART.  THEN, ON 08/09/2018, A BATTERY CHARGE WARNING CAME ON AND THEY REPLACED THE ALTERNATOR.  WHAT IS EVEN MORE TROUBLING, IS THESE VERY PROBLEMS ARE ALL OVER THE INTERNET.  ALL WORK HAS BEEN COVERED UNDER WARRANTEE BUT I HAVE WASTED THE BETTER PART OF TWO FULL DAYS DRIVING TO/FROM THE DEALER OR WAITING IN THE WAITING ROOM.  I HAVE FILED A COMPLAINT WITH FCA (JEEP).  IT APPEARS AS THOUGH THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM JEEP ENGINEERS HAVE DESIGNED FOR THESE WRANGLER RUBICON JLS  IS FLAWED TO SAY THE LEAST.
THE CAR DOESN'T TRACK STRAIGHT WITHOUT CONTINUAL ADJUSTMENTS WITH THE STEERING WHEEL. IT WILL DRIFT A LITTLE RIGHT, THEN I NUDGE THE STEERING WHEEL TO THE LEFT AND IT WILL DRIFT LEFT AND HAVE TO CORRECT TO THE RIGHT AGAIN.
I NOTICE WHEN DRIVING ON 2 LANE HIGHWAYS AND MEETING BIGGER VEHICLES THE HOOD COMES UP AND IT APPEARS AS IF THE RUBBER LATCHES ARE GOING TO SNAP.  IT WILL ABSOLUTELY STARTLE YOU AND I COULD SEE IT CAUSING AN ACCIDENT.  THERE IS NO WAY A HOOD SHOULD LIFT UP AS MUCH AS IT DOES.  THIS OCCURS AT ANY SPEED OVER 50MPH WHEN MEETING OTHER VEHICLES AND IS WORSE THE BIGGER THE OTHER VEHICLE IS.
THE JEEP WANDERS AND DRIFTS AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS...STEERING IS BAD!!!   I GET THE WANDERING AND THE DEAD SPOT AND FLOATING FEEL WHEN ON LONG STRAIGHT AWAYS DOING 50+ MPH. IT'S A CAUSE AND EFFECT BECAUSE OF THE UNRESPONSIVENESS OF THE STEERING, SO YOU OVERCORRECT CAUSING YOU TO GO SIDE TO SIDE IN THE LANE. THUS MAKING IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP IT GOING STRAIGHT AND REQUIRING YOU TO DRIVE WITH TWO HANDS ON THE WHEEL. MY TIRES WERE AT 44 PSI. AIRED THEM DOWN TO 38 PSI. DID NOT HELP BECAUSE THE STEERING AT HIGHER SPEEDS IS JUST SLOPPY AND UNRESPONSIVE WITH A GOOD 1 INCH PLUS OF PLAY IN THE WHEEL. I ALSO TRIED THE ROUGH COUNTRY STEERING STABILIZER. IT DID NOTHING TO HELP THE WANDERING. IT WAS ACTUALLY WORSE THEN STOCK. IN FACT I GOT A LOT MORE BOUNCE ON THE TIRES WHEN I HIT A BUMP OR HOLE IN THE ROAD, SO I PUT THE STOCK STEERING STABILIZER BACK ON. IT SEEMS THAT IT TAKES THE COMPUTER A FEW SECONDS TOO LONG TO RECEIVE THE INPUT FROM THE STEERING WHEEL. I'M NO ENGINEER OR MECHANIC AND I'M NOT TOO SMART (LOL) BUT I CAN TELL YOU THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE SOFTWARE AND STEERING BOX (GEAR). LIKE I SAID, I HAVE HAD NUMEROUS JEEPS AND TRUCKS AND I HAVE BEEN A POLICE OFFICER FOR OVER 20 YEARS, SO HAVE A TON OF DRIVING EXPERIENCE AND I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY VEHICLE WITH THIS STEERING ISSUE. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE ESPECIALLY AT HIGHER SPEEDS ON MAJOR HIGHWAYS, WHERE YOU FEEL IT AND DEAL WITH IT MOST. JEEP AND FCA NEED TO GET THERE [XXX] IN GEAR AND FIX THIS ISSUE ASAP BEFORE THERE IS A FATALITY.  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).
MY NEW JEEP WRANGLER HAS AN EXCESSIVE ABOUT OF 'PLAY' IN THE STEERING.  I'M CONSTANTLY TRYING TO CORRECT IT JUST TO KEEP IT GOING THE DIRECTION INTENDED.  IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DRIVE ANY DISTANCE.  I'M WORN OUT WHEN I ARRIVE AT MY DESTINATION DUE TO STEERING ISSUE.  I'M ALSO AFRAID THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE.  PLEASE HELP!
WINDSHIELD WIPERS AND HEADLIGHTS STUCK ON DESPITE CONTROLS SET TO OFF POSITION. NO TURN SIGNALS OR HIGH BEAMS EITHER. HAD TO PULL THE WINDSHIELD WIPER FUSE TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE VEHICLE HOME. TRIED TO DISCONNECT THE BATTERY AND STEP ON THE BRAKE, THEN LEAVE IT DISCONNECTED FOR 20 MINUTES, BUT THIS DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE. VEHICLE IS NEW, ONLY A COUPLE OF WEEKS OF OWNERSHIP. COMPLETELY STOCK, NO MODIFICATIONS. *TT  *TR
The contact owns a 2019 Jeep Wrangler. The contact stated while driving 20 MPH, the vehicle stalled. The contact stated that the vehicle was restarted. The contact continued to drive, but the power steering became inoperable. The contact stated that the vehicle became extremely hot, and the cells popped and damaged the battery. The contact stated that the check engine, power steering, and battery warning lights were illuminated. The vehicle was towed to the residence. The contact called the local dealer, but the vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was contacted, but no additional assistance was provided. The failure mileage was approximately 49,700.
Lost communication on ABS, traction control , 4wd service, vehicle put itself in auto park, steering wheel locked up and wasn't able to turn the steering wheel, dashboard lights flickering, try turning on vehicle but wasn't responding until a 3 minutes later , check engine light is still on but doesn't have any store messages on dashboard, I have a video of it.
ABS module went out in July of 2024, after being replaced in February 2024. Jeep does not have any of the parts available, the same part was recalled for the Grand Cherokee and Ram 1500. My jeep has been unable to drive since the part malfunctioned.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a bulletin about coolant leaks in Jeep Wranglers with 2.0L engines:  Bulletin: 07-001-20 REV. A, dated April 9, 2020  Vehicles affected: Jeep Wranglers built before November 30, 2019 with a 2.0L I4 DOHC DI Turbo Engine or 2.0L I4 DOHC DI Turbo Etorque Engine  Issue: The coolant inlet tube fasteners may become loose, causing a coolant leak  Solution: Remove the coolant inlet tube fasteners, clean the threads, add Thread Loc, and reinstall  Tightening torque: Tighten to 11N∙m (8ft. lbs.)  A coolant leak can cause the engine to overheat and potentially lead to engine failure.   Engine fan was not shutting off after leaving a covered parking garage and an engine alert appeared and displayed that the engine was overheating. Had my jeep towed home. We were able to see that the main coolant reservoir was empty and that there was dry coolant all around the engine. Our jeep has not been fixed and is not drivable. Need guidance as there isn’t a recall on this but a known issue, and you have a bulletin out about it.
While driving at interstate speed and passing over an irregular surface the jeep started to shimmy and I later found out it was called "Death Wobble". The jeep started to wonder across the lanes of the highway and I had to slow to 45 mph to stop the shimmy and get control of the vehicle, I assume the the problem is in the steering or the front suspension. After talking to a mechanic I found out that a recall has already been performed to replace the steering vibration damper. The mechanic could not find any loose or damaged front end parts upon inspection. Since the initial incident the shimmy has happened multiple times at slower and slower speeds. There was no prior warning by the jeep instrument panel.
While accelerating, vehicle refused to shift into second gear and losing power while  attempting to accelerate onto the interstate. With the pedal all the way down, the vehicle was going 5mph.   No warning lights, sounds or messages were provided.  This could have been fatal as it occurred at a merge point on a 70mph interstate.  Upon dealership review, the high pressure fuel pump has malfunctioned requiring replacement under 50,000 miles.
My 2019 jeep wrangler steering wheel starts to vibrate then shake and then the car shakes while I am driving on the highway. It happened 4 times in the last week. One time last week , 2 times last night and once tonight while driving on the highway.
2019 wrangler jl sport 2 door manual. 68,000miles. started with flashing abs light 2months ago with then start stop not working given i replaced the aux battery 3 months before this happened delearship said both batteries needed replaced so i did that. moving forward 2 weeks agos i got all these codes ,picture attached ,ran the scanner because i got my dash lit up with every warning you can possibly imagine. every time it happened ( more then 5times , less  then 10)it wouldnt let me turn it over to off but wound turn over to acc. while making a weird noise(video attached) .finally it will turn over to off..one day on the turnpike the jeep did this but this time i lost my power steering. the dealership has had it now for over a week. the pulled over 60codes for communication. they clear the codes and have driven it over 100miles not being able to replicate the-same problem i had and no codes are popping up. they still have the jeep.
I am reporting the Jeep "death wobble". I have made an appointment to have the dealer look at the issue but experienced the death wobble on the interstate two different times traveling at 72 and 73 MPH. After going over a relatively small bump at 73 MPH going east on I-94 at right around mile marker 260 in Wisconsin, my Jeep shook uncontrollably until I reduced speed to under 40 MPH. Again, on my way home on I-94, my daughter hit a bump right around mile marker 246 heading west. The Jeep violently shook and she had to pull over and come to a stop. While we did not get into an accident, the need for rapid deceleration on the interstate absolutely could cause an accident. I am so disappointed in Jeep!
Vehicle's front end violently shakes harmonically side to side when driving over 50 mph upon hitting uneven surfaces on highway and interested. When this occurs, the driver loses the ability to safely steer and must brake which is also unsafe to do on the highway or interstate. The harmonic vibration resonates until the speed is reduced to approximately 35 mph.
Death wobble same as my 2008 wrangler that I traded in for a newer model and same problem! Someone will die, it's terrible!!! It happened 3 times in 1 day. I can't take it on the expressway at all.
steering locked while driving at 50 mph. Had to switch car off in middle of street and restart to get functioning steering restored. Five minutes later it locked steering wheel again and could not shift lanes. Luckily accident was avoided however I can't imagine what would have happened if this was on the highway. Parked car and towed to Jeep dealership for service. My wife and family were terrified of this incident as it was life threatening situation. Dealer informed me that they have never had this happen before and they are troubleshooting as we speak. Service engine light went on (yellow) and "service shifter" code showed up on screen. This all was sudden and there was no warning before driving vehicle.
The 48v battery doesn't charge properly, stop/start doesn't function as intended. When the car broke down the high voltage cable that connects the MGU and the 48v battery required repair.
The entire clutch system failed and the vehicle passenger compartment filled with smoke. It was difficult to breath and burned my eyes I had to pull over immediately.  I had the the vehicle towed to the dealer, upon arrival the dealer indicated that there was a safety recall that was limited to “computer components” and involved a software fix. They then proceed to tell me that the the entire clutch system had failed and they could not tell if it was my driving or the recall parts that had impacted.  They then proceed to hand me a $2,000+ repair bill, this is a top of the line vehicle less than three 4 years old with no more than 43k miles.  I reached out to Jeep/Mopar/FCA/Stallantis whatever they are going by today, and was referred back to the dealer without any resolution.
The Uconnect Radio keeps freezing and restarting all the time. This is troublesome when you cannot use your backup camera or your navigation system. It is a distraction to the driver. You cannot turn down the volume, change the temperature or anything else during this freeze and rebooting.
WHEN GOING OVER 40MPH THE TRUCK SHAKES UNCONTROLLABLY, WITH ONLY LITTLE BUMPS IN THE ROAD.  THIS IS CAUSING ISSUES FOR ME AND IT'S VERY UNSAFE. MAKES ME NOT WANT TO EVEN DRIVE.  THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION WHEN IT HAPPENS. FEELS LIKE THE WHEEL IS GOING TO COME OFF. SCARED.
WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AT APPROXIMATELY 70 MPH, THE JEEP BEGAN TO SHAKE (WABBLE) VIOLENTLY. THE STEERING COLUMN BECAME HARD TO CONTROL DUE TO THE SHAKING OF THE JEEP. SLOWING DOWN DID NOT SEEM TO HELP SO I PULLED OFF THE FREEWAY AND CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP. THIS ALLEVIATED THE ISSUE TEMPORARILY. HOWEVER, THE SHAKING/WABBLE OCCURRED 6 MORE TIMES DURING MY 200-MILE TRIP. I TOOK MY JEEP INTO THE DEALER TO GET FIXED AND WAITED 3 WEEKS FOR THE PART TO COME IN. DURING THIS TIME, THE WABBLE HAPPENED TWICE AT FREEWAY SPEEDS (65 MPH+). BOTH TIMES, I HAD TO PULL OFF THE FREEWAY AND COME TO A COMPLETE STOP TO REMEDY THE ISSUE. MY SERVICING DEALER REPLACED THE STEERING DAMPENER AS THEY SAID THAT WAS THE ISSUE. UNFORTUNATELY, AT FREEWAY SPEED, I ENCOUNTERED THE SHAKING/WABBLE AGAIN. SPEEDS OF 50 MPH OR LESS DO NOT SEEM TO TRIGGER THE SHAKING, BUT IT OCCURS INTERMITTENTLY AT SPEEDS OVER 50 MPH. AS LONG AS I AM IN THE SLOW LANE WITH ROOM TO EXIT THE ROAD, IT IS SAFE TO DRIVE. HOWEVER, IT IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE IF THERE IS NO WAY TO EXIT THE ROADWAY WHEN IT OCCURS AS THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE SHAKING IS TO COME TO A COMPLETE STOP.
WHILE DRIVING THE MIDDLE LANE ON THE HIGHWAY DOING 70 MPH I DROVE OVER AN OVERPASS WITH A SLIGHT DEPRESSION AND MY STEERING WHEEL STARTED TO VIOLENTLY SHAKE SO MUCH SO THAT I HAD DIFFICULTY MOVING TO THE RIGHT LANE AND THEN ONTO THE EMERGENCY SHOULDER, THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. THE DEALER REPLACED THE STEERING DAMPENER THE SECOND TIME TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM.  THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED, THE FIRST TIME WAS ABOUT 14 MONTHS EARLIER WHEN THE DEALER REPLACED THE STEERING DAMPENER FOR THE FIRST TIME. TO DATE I AM ON MY THIRD STEERING DAMPENER IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS DESIGN DISASTER THAT IS AN EXTREME HAZARD TO ALL THE SAFE DRIVERS ON OUR HIGHWAYS INCLUDING ME.  THANK YOU.
THIS JEEP HAS BEEN TO THE DEALER 4  TIMES PREVIOUSLY FOR A SIMILAR ISSUE.  THIS INCIDENT, WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AT APPROXIMATELY 45 MPH ALL THE INSTRUMENTS STARTED GOING CRAZY (PREVIOUSLY HAPPENED MANY TIMES).  SHORTLY THEREAFTER THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKED UP.  THE POWER STEERING WAS STILL WORKING, BUT THE WHEEL WOULD ONLY TURN AROUND 1 INCH IN EITHER DIRECTION.  BRAKING WAS NORMAL.  MANEUVERED THE JEEP OFF THE ROAD AND HAD TOWED TO RON CARTER CHRYSLER JEEP DODGE DEALERSHIP IN LEAGUE CITY, TX.  THE DEALERSHIP HAS HAD THIS VEHICLE 4 TIMES IN THE PAST FOR THIS ISSUE.  IN THE PAST THE STEERING HAS NOT BEEN AFFECTED, BUT THE VEHICLE WON'T START OR THE PARKING BRAKE WILL BE SET AND YOU CAN'T MOVE OR OTHER WEIRD DIFFERENT STUFF HAPPENS.  THE STEERING ISSUE IN THIS PAST INCIDENT IS SERIOUS.  WHEN THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER INQUIRED WHAT HAPPENED HE TOLD ME HE HAS TOWED PROBABLY 20 OTHER NEWER JEEP WRANGLERS WITH SIMILAR ISSUES.  THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME LAST TIME WE BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN AND IT WAS STILL ACTING UP THAT THERE WERE 15 FAULTS STORED.  THE ISSUE USUALLY CLEARS ITSELF UP BY THE TIME WE GET IT TO THE DEALER.  THE DEALER CLAIMS THEY HAVE TALKED WITH CHRYSLER AND CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHATS WRONG AND HAVE JUST BEEN THROWING DARTS REPLACING VARIOUS THINGS.  IF THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER IS RIGHT ON HOW MANY VEHICLES HES TOWED WITH THIS PROBLEM THERE IS A SERIOUS ELECTRICAL / COMPUTER ISSUE GOING ON WITH THESE VEHICLES THAT IS GOING TO CAUSE ACCIDENTS.
MY WRANGLER HAS A PULL TO THE RIGHT SINCE THE DAY I BOUGHT IT BRAND NEW IN OCTOBER 2019.  IT HAS LESS THAN 6000 MILES ON IT AND IS UNMODIFIED.  I'VE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER 5 TIMES FOR THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE.  THEY'VE REPLACE THE FRONT AXEL AND DONE ALIGNMENTS.  IT STILL PULLS SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT.  THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID IT'S "A CHARACTERISTIC" OF THE JL WRANGLERS (2018 AND UP),  TO PULL TO THE RIGHT.  HE CLAIMS THAT THEY ALL PULL TO RIGHT AND IT'S NORMAL FOR THE WRANGLER NOT TO GO IN A STRAIGHT LINE. I WAS TOLD THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO BE DONE AND THAT I JUST HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT THE CAR WILL NOT GO IN A STRAIGHT LINE.  *TR
WHILE DRIVING 70 ON INTERSTATE 95 THE VEHICLE STARTED TO SHAKE IMMENSELY. HAD TO IMMEDIATELY BRING THE VEHICLE TO A SPEED OF 35 TO STOP. THIS ALMOST CAUSED AN ACCIDENT WITH THE VEHICLE BEHIND AS THEY HAD TO BRAKE AND VEER INTO ANOTHER LANE TO AVOID IT. I AM IN PALM BEACH FL AND WILL BE BRINGING TO DEALER RIGHT AWAY. THE VEHICLE IS A 2019 WITH 13K MILES WHICH I JUST PURCHASED LAST WEEK.
WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEED 50MPH ON RTE 290 AT COLLEGE SQUARE CORNER  VEHICLE FELT LIKE WHEELS WERE GOING TO FALL OFF LOT OF SHAKING AND ALMOST LOST CONTROL VERY DANGEROUS SLOWED DOWN TO 30MPH AND VIBRATIONS SUBSIDED  THIS HAS HAPPEND ONCE BEFORE ON SAME DAY  JEEP WRANGLER HAS 500 MILES ON IT DEALER "PUTNAM JEEP" HAS BEEN CALLED AND WILL BE BRINGING JEEP INTO SHOP ASAP
WHEN DRIVING ABOVE 25 MILES PER HOUR THERE IS SHIMMYING, WOBBLING, LOOSE PLAY, IN THE STEERING WHEEL AND HARD TO KEEP ON THE ROAD. IT IS IN MOTION AND ON THE ROAD. HIGHWAY MORE THAN CITY STREETS.
AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS 55-70 IT IS VERY HARD TO KEEP THE JEEP IN IT'S LANE. WHEN A SEMI PASSES IT IS DANGEROUS AND MY WIFE NOW WON'T DRIVE THE JEEP.
STEERING IS EXTREMELY LOOSE CAUSING EXCESSIVE STEERING CORRECTIONS AND LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN SAFETY.  RECALL FOR STEERING DAMPER WAS PERFORMED BUT THERE WAS NO IMPROVEMENT IN THE LOOSE STEERING
I HAVE ISSUES WITH THE FRONT END WHEN DRIVING AT NORMAL HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND HIT A BUMP IN THE ROAD.  THE FRONT END STARTS VIOLENTLY SHAKING FROM SIDE TO SIDE.  I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS 2 TIMES THIS WEEK AND BOTH TIMES ALMOST GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE IT THROUGH ME ACROSS THE HIGHWAY.  THIS IS A 2019 WITH LESS THAN 8,000 MILES ON IT.  I ALSO HAVE MADE NO MODIFICATIONS TO IT- STANDARD FACTORY STOCK MODEL.    I CAME HOME AND GOOGLED WHAT HAPPENED AND AM NOW LEARNING THIS IS THE JEEP DEATH WOBBLE.  WHY IN THE WORLD IS THIS VEHICLE ALLOWED TO BE DRIVEN WITH SUCH A KNOWN ISSUE?!
VEHICLE'S STEERING IS TOO LOOSE, VEHICLE WANDERS AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND NEEDS CONSTANT CORRECTION TO KEEP THE VEHICLE IN THE LANE AND STRAIGHT. OVERALL, I FEEL THE VEHICLE IS NOT 100% SAFE TO BE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY.
STEERING HAS ABOUT A 2 INCH DEAD SPOT IN THE MIDDLE WHERE WHEN YOU TURN THE WHEEL AND THE STEERING DOES NOT RESPOND. IT ALSO HAS A "WANDERING" OVER THE ROAD THAT GETS AMPLIFIED WITH THE DEAD SPOT. YOU WIND UP CONSTANTLY DOING SMALL STEERING CORRECTIONS TO COMPENSATE AND IT GETS TIRING TO DO SO. FEEL LIKE YOU ARE WANDERING IN YOUR LANE EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE ON A STRAIGHT ROAD. BEEN TO THE DEALERSHIP 3 TIMES FOR THIS AND STILL NO FIX. THEY'VE REPLACED THE STEERING GEAR BOX AND THE DAMPER (PER FCA RECALL). THE FIRST 2 TRIPS TO THE DEALER YIELDED THEM BASICALLY BLOWING ME OFF ANS STATED IT DRIVES AS DESIGNED. THAT'S NOT CORRECT, IT DOES NOT DRIVE CORRECTLY.
I PICKED UP MY NEW JEEP AT THE DEALER AND WENT NOT EVEN A COUPLE BLOCKS AWAY AND NOTICED THE STEERING WAS REALLY SLOPPY. THE DEALER CALLED TO GET MY EMAIL AND I TOLD THEM ABOUT IT. THEY SAID BRING IT BACK, WHICH I DID TODAY( THE NEXT MORNING.)  TOO MUCH PLAY, CONSTANT CORRECTIONS, DRIFTED. I JUST DROPPED IT OFF AND THEY SAID IT HAD A STEERING DAMPER RECALL ON THE VEHICLE. THIS IS MY 3RD JEEP WRANGLER(1999 AND 2004) WERE MY OTHER ONES AND THEY WERE FINE. JEEP NEEDS TO ADDRESS THIS ASAP. IT IS NOT SAFE AND I AM NOT VERY HOPEFUL THIS RECALL WILL FIX IT.
THIS VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED NEW FROM A DEALER 5 HOURS FROM MY HOME .THE DRIVE HOME INCLUDED SOME 2 LANE HIGHWAYS BUT MOSTLY INTERSTATE. CONTROLLING THE JEEP AND KEEPING IT ON THE ROAD HOME WAS AN EXHAUSTING AND CONCENTRATED EFFORT.  THE STEERING WAS EVERYWHERE AND I'M SURE I LOOKED LIKE A DRUNK DRIVER TO MOST PEOPLE.  TODAY I HAVE DRIVEN THE JEEP TO MY LOCAL DEALER ONLY TO BE TOLD BY THE FEMALE SERVICE WRITER THAT THE JEEP WILL LEARN MY DRIVING AFTER ABOUT 1000 MILES .SHE STATED SHE KNOWS THIS BECAUSE SHE HAS THIS SAME STYLE JEEP. THERE IS NO WAY THIS IS NORMAL STEERING  .
LOOSE STEERING, LOTS OF PLAY, WANDERING ALL OVER THE ROAD.  TOOK THE JEEP BACK ONE WEEK AFTER I BOUGHT HER, DEALER LOOKED AT HER, ACKNOWLEDGED IT WAS DANGEROUS AND FORCED ME INTO A LOANER BECAUSE OF THE DANGER AND WOULDN'T LET ME TAKE TEH JEEP HOME.  EVENTUALLY CHANGED THE POWER STEERING BOX. I PICKED IT UP AND IT STILL HAD EXCESSIVE PLAY IN THE STEERING WHEEL AND WAS WANDERING ALL OVER THE ROAD AND NEEDED CONSTANT CORRECTION.  CALLED DEALER THEY CLAIMED IT WAS DRIVEN BY THE SHOP FOREMAN AND WAS NOW AS INTENDED.     WHEN STATIONARY YOU CAN SEE THE EXCESSIVE PLAY IN THE STEERING WHEEL.  WHEN IN MOTION, ESPECIALLY ON HIGHWAYS THE EXCESSIVE PLAY BECOMES SERIOUSLY DANGEROUS WHEN THE VEHICLE WANDERS BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MAKE SHARP ADJUSTMENTS FAST WITH A NON RESPONSIVE STEERING WHEEL.
MY BRAND NEW 2019 2-DR. JEEP WRANGLER JL HAS A SERIOUS STEERING PROBLEM.  AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, ESPECIALLY ABOVE 50MPH, THE STEERING WHEEL NEEDS CONSTANT SMALL ADJUSTMENTS TO KEEP THE VEHICLE IN ITS LANE.  BOTH I AND MY WIFE FIND IT DIFFICULT TO KEEP THE VEHICLE ON TRACK IN NORMAL HIGHWAY DRIVING CONDITIONS.  WE FEEL THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN.  THE SLIGHTEST DISTRACTION OF THE DRIVER'S ATTENTION FROM THE CONSTANT NEED FOR SMALL STEERING CORRECTIONS COULD AND WILL EVENTUALLY RESULT IN THE VEHICLE WANDERING OUT OF ITS LANE INTO AN ADJACENT LANE, CAUSING A HIGH-SPEED ACCIDENT.  UNFORTUNATELY, A CURSORY INVESTIGATION OF SUCH AN ACCIDENT WOULD PROBABLY AND UNJUSTIFIABLY RESULT IN A FINDING OF DRIVER INATTENTIVENESS, COMPLETELY OVERLOOKING THE UNDERLYING MECHANICAL CAUSE.   OUR DEALERSHIP SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE STATES THAT HE IS UNAWARE OF THIS PROBLEM WITH THESE VEHICLES, EVEN THOUGH THE INTERNET IS FLOODED WITH COMPLAINTS AND ANECDOTAL ACCOUNTS OF THIS PROBLEM WITH THE 2018 AND 2019 WRANGLER JL'S.  THE MANUFACTURER, FIAT CHRYSLER, HAS YET TO PROVIDE DEFINITIVE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OR REMEDY FOR THIS PROBLEM.  GIVEN THE SERIOUSNESS OF A STEERING MALFUNCTION IN THE 2018 AND 2019 WRANGLER JL VEHICLES, AND THE PROBABILITY OF ITS CAUSING OR HAVING CAUSED SERIOUS ACCIDENTS, WE SINCERELY HOPE THE NHTSA WILL ENGAGE FIAT CHRYSLER TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME.  *TR
#1, STEERING CONTROL IS TERRIBLE WITH THIS JEEP. HAVE TO CORRECT THE STEERING CONTINUOUSLY JUST TO KEEP IT IN THE PROPER LANE. OTHER NEW JEEP OWNERS THAT I HAVE LISTENED TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM TO THEIR DEALERSHIPS. THEY GET THE SAME ANSWERS AS I HAVE RECEIVER FROM THE SERVICE MANAGERS "IT'S A JEEP THING AND YOU JUST HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT". THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND THE COMPANY NEEDS TO CORRECT IT BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED.    #2. DRIVETRAIN. I HAVE OWNED OTHER JEEPS IN MY TIME BUT NEVER ONE WITH A TRANSFER CASE AS STILL TO SHIFT AS THIS ONE. AND ONCE AGAIN I AM NOT THE ONLY JEEP DRIVER COMPLAINING ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS TO SHIFT FROM HI TOLO FOUR WHEEL DRIVE AND IMPOSSIBLE TO GET INTO LOW LOW. I AM NOT EXACTLY WEAK AND I HAVE TO PULL ON THE LEVER TO GET IT INTO LOW WITH ALL MY MIGHT. MY DEALERSHIP TELLS ME IT WILL LOOSEN UP THE MORE YOU USE IT. MY WIFE DRIVES THIS VEHICLE AND SHE FINDS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT INTO LOW RANGE NO MATTER HOW HARD SHE TRIES. I BOUGHT THIS NEW VEHICLE TO BE ABLE TO USE IT NOW NOT SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE.
UNKNOWN  The display panel on the instrument cluster has went out. There was an open recall for newer models (2022-2024), but my vehicle's year (2020) was not included. After going through multiple forums, and speaking with many dealerships, this has been an on-going issue with multiple Jeep owners.
Had to take my 2020 wrangler in to have accessory battery replaced as it had drained my newly purchased battery and my car wouldn’t start. Repair shop replaced both batteries and about a week later the check engine light came on for about 2 minutes then went off so I chalked it up to the battery replacement. It didn’t come back on again until about 3 weeks later when I started feeling a slip when going in to second gear. When I got home after having that issue I noticed a small collection of what looked to me like transmission fluid  on my garage floor so I had the car towed to the repair shop again. They informed me that engine oil was mixing with coolant due to a bad oil cooler. Between that diagnosis and my car completely breaking down and cracking my engine block the car was driven a total of 14 miles at the most. There was never any other signs prior to me taking it to the shop that the oil cooler had gone bad and even when they replaced the batteries no codes came up for the bad oil cooler and nobody noticed anything while working in the area. . Since then I have learned that this has been an ongoing issue with the wrangler since at least 2012 models and there has been several class action suits that were settled out of court I’m assuming so they don’t have to spend the money recalling and repairing every affected vehicle and finding a fix for future models. Meanwhile I have only had my car for 2 years as of last week and now am being charged $15000 $8000 of which I have to pay up front to even find out how long the parts needed will be on back order. Could be a week could be a year. Not to mention that I have no car to drive and a car payment to make while I wait.  This needs to be fixed as these cars are overheating out of nowhere and shutting down when it does. It’s a safety issue as well as a consumer issue.
The contact owns a 2020 Jeep Wrangler. The contact stated that when the vehicle was started, the A/C system failed to function as intended. No warning lights were illuminated. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic where it was diagnosed and determined that the instrument cluster had failed. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The contact related the failure to NHTSA Campaign Number: 24V652000 (ELECTRICAL SYSTEM); however, the VIN was not included. The failure mileage was approximately 29,000.
The contact owns a 2020 Jeep Wrangler. The contact stated while driving at approximately 65-70 MPH, the vehicle experienced the death wobble. There were no warning lights illuminated. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic who determined that the failure was related to the track bar. The vehicle was repaired, but the failure recurred. The contact stated that the death wobble failure was intermittent but had progressed over time. The local dealer was not contacted. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was not contacted. The failure mileage was approximately 37,000.
The contact owns a 2020 Jeep Wrangler. The contact stated that while attempting to start her vehicle, the instrument panel was dark. The vehicle was taken to a dealer where it was diagnosed and determined that the instrument panel needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and informed the contact to have the dealer apply for a goodwill assistance application which the dealer requested; however, the manufacturer denied the request. The contact related the failure to NHTSA Campaign Number: 24V652000 (ELECTRICAL SYSTEM). The failure mileage was 84,000.
My vehicle had been experiencing loud acceleration as well as difficulty while driving. Upon taking the vehicle to the dealership where purchased they informed me the rear differential on the vehicle was starting to fail. They informed me they had ordered the part from Mopar with no recollection of when it would be in other than it stating it was on backorder. We have tried getting in touch with Mopar over expediting the piece to be told they also have no idea when it will be in, but they are working on it. The vehicle has been messed up for over a month and is worsening. I am having greater difficulty driving it and at points it begins to bounce while moving. It is getting to the point I am now starting to worry for my own as well as others safety because I am unsure when it will fully stop working.
I am the origional owner of this vehicle.  The vehicle has approximately 67,000 miles on it.  I own a Mopar premier extended warranty covering the vehicle for 7 years, or 100,000 miles, whatever comes first.    My complaint, which I believe creates a severe safety hazard on a public roadway, is the inner front fender wheel lines have failed on three different occasions requiring replacement.  When the liners fail, it leaves exposed the 4  individual brake lines from the master cylinder.  Road debris, when the inner fender wheel well is missing, can easily strick the brake lines by road debris thrown from the front tire while driving leading to brake failure and loss of control which can result in injury up to and including death to the driver, occupants, or others.  I have contacted corporate Jeep on two different occasions to ask for repairs, and they refused to correct the issue.  Their position is the vehicle is beyond the 3 year, 36,000 mile initial warranty, and my extended warrenty will not cover the repair as this wheel well liner is considerd a "trim piece".  I am looking to NHTSA for assistance as this failure is something that should be mandated for a safety recall, and the dealer has told me the design of the liner on the JL series is prone  to failure.  I have owned 4 other Jeep Rubicon's over the past 10-15 years, and this has not been an issue on my other vehicles prior to the redesign of current Jeep Wrangler JL series.  I have filed a complaint with Jeep, and they refuse to escallate my issue.  The dealer says they cannot address the issue without corporate approval, and Jeep does not have a work flow to escallate the issue internally.  I have photos which will clearly show the exposed 4 brake lines at the upper edge of the frame rail.  I attempted to upload 8 photos of approximately 80-90 KB each.  Your web portal would not accept any photos.  Help me submit photos for review.
At or about 68mph always while on interstate highways if I drive over certain bumps in the road my vehicle gets a dangerous shaking of the steering wheel that is very violent shaking.  This shaking does not stop until I bring my vehicle to a complete stop.
The contact owns a 2020 Jeep Wrangler. The contact stated while driving 60 MPH, the vehicle started shuddering violently, the wheels were wobbling, and the steering wheel was vibrating significantly, causing the contact to lose control of the vehicle. The contact was able to regain control of the steering wheel and pull to the side of the roadway. The contact stated that she continued driving, and the vehicle operated as intended. The contact stated that the failure reoccurred 24 hours later. The vehicle was taken to the dealer, where it was diagnosed that the steering damper needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure, and a case was opened. The contact was awaiting a call back from the manufacturer. The failure mileage was 49,300.
The contact's partner owns a 2020 Jeep Wrangler. The contact received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 22V767000 (Fuel System, Gasoline, Engine) however, the part to do the recall repair was not yet available. The local dealer was contacted. The contact stated that the manufacturer had exceeded a reasonable amount of time for the recall repair. The manufacturer was made aware of the issue. The contact had not experienced a failure. VIN tool confirms parts not available.
The Jeep has had a deadly death wobble. it has been awful to drive Jeep has parts on back order for 6 months. it continues to throw me off the road or into oncoming traffic.
Sun visor broke at the point where it attaches to the roof pillar causing the visor to fall in front of my face and block my vision while driving at highway speed.
Shifter cables on my 2020 Jeep Wrangler have fallen off FIVE times leaving me unable to shift the car or drive it and it is necessary to pull over or coast over to the side of the road wherever I may be. The inability to shift is accompanied by a terrible burning smell. The dealership has attempted to repair it by putting the cables back on and by replacing the cables with new cables to no avail, the problem continues to occur. My safety and the safety of others is put at risk because the car is not able to function properly and maintain speed. Without warning this can occur and cause an accident on the road or highway. I have filed a Lemon Law complaint with the Jeep manufacturer. The problem has occurred FIVE times 3/29/22, 9/20/22, 10/14/22, 10/17/22, 11/22/22. All five times were without warning.
Engine surges forward when coming to a stop (brakes applied) or when at a complete stop and the engine is in drive.this happened in Aug 2020 with 5000 miles on Odometer, and again in June 2022 with 26000 miles.
Windshield cracked in cold with defroster on from top of windshield down between steering wheel and rear view mirror. Upon research this is a common problem in the cold and could cause visibility issues in cold weather states.
While driving at around 30mph on a winding hill the steering locked forcing a crash into a guard rail.
THE WINDSHIELD DEFROSTER DOESN'T REACH THE OUTER PORTIONS OF THE WINDSHIELD WHICH RESULTS IN DANGEROUS DRIVING CONDITIONS IN COLD WEATHER.  I HAVE TO TURN THE HEAT ALL THE WAY ON HIGH AND THE FAN ALL THE WAY UP TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS HURTING MY EYES AND IT STILL DOESN'T PREVENT ICE ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES.  I HAVE TO LEAN TO THE RIGHT TO SEE THROUGH MY WINDSHIELD.  THIS HAPPENS WHILE SITTING STILL, DRIVING, ETC.   IT HAPPENS ANYTIME THE WEATHER IS BELOW FREEZING AND THERE ARE WET CONDITIONS
WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION THERE IS A NOTICEABLE AMOUNT OF PLAY IN THE STEERING. SO MUCH AS AN INCH OR MORE TO EITHER SIDE OF 12 O'CLOCK. IT IS NERVE WRACKING WHEN DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. THE STEERING WHEEL KEEPS SEE-SAWING BACK AND FORTH. I'VE HAD IT TO THE DEALER WHERE PURCHASED THREE TIMES FOR THIS PROBLEM. THERE IS A SERVICE BULLETIN OUT REGARDING THE STEERING GEAR BOX. THE DEALER INSTALLED THE PARTS THAT NEEDED REPLACING. THIS DID NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM. THEY STATE THAT THIS IS NORMAL FOR THE JEEP WRANGLER. BELIEVING THAT IT IS NOT NORMAL I TOOK IT TO ANOTHER DEALER. I RECEIVED THE SAME RESPONSE, IT CANNOT BE ADJUSTED OR CORRECTED IN ANY WAY. AGAIN THEY STATED THAT THIS IS NORMAL FOR THE   WRANGLER. I HAVE REPAIR INVOICES, BUT DO NOT KNOW HOW TO UPLOAD THEM. FROM INQUIRING ON THE INTERNET ABOUT THE PROBLEM I SEE THAT THERE QUITE A FEW BLOGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN IN REGARDING THE SAME PROBLEM.
VEHICLE IS CONSTANTLY VEERING LEFT AND RIGHT RESULTING IN CONSTANT STEERING CORRECTION. FVC HAS ACKNOWLEDGE WITH A BULLETIN AND FIX BUT NO RECALL SO DEALER WON'T FIX IT.
WHEN DRIVING OVER 50 MPH A LOT OF PLAY IN STEERING WE ARE CONSTANTLY HAVING TO STEER LEFT TO RIGHT TO KEEP VEHICLE ON THE ROAD IT'S NEW 2020 SAHARA WITH 300 MILES ON IT AND IT WONDERS ALL OVER THE ROAD
WITH LESS THAN 400 MILES ON THE VEHICLE, A TAPPING SOUND COULD BE HEARD FROM THE ENGINE BAY. WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT INTO THE DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE ENGINE. THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN STATED THERE WAS A CAMSHAFT ISSUE FOR A TAPPET THAT HAD FAILED AND WAS DELIVERED FROM THE FACTORY WITH THE DEFECT. THIS HAS RESULTED IN A REPLACEMENT OF THE ROCKERS, TAPPETS, AND INTAKE AND EXHAUST CAMSHAFTS.
MY JEEP PULLS ALL OVER THE ROAD, WOBBLING WHEEL.  *TR
THE STEERING HAS TO MUCH PLAY AND THE JEEP WANDERS
MY 2020 JEEP WRANGLER RUBICON UNLIMITED EXHIBITS THE LOOSE STEERING ISSUE AFFECTING THE 2018/19 AND 2020 JL MODELS. WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE AT ALL POSTED SPEEDS IT REQUIRES CONSTANT LEFT AND RIGHT STEERING WHEEL CORRECTIONS OR INPUT TO KEEP THE VEHICLE FROM WANDERING OUT OF THE LANE. FCA AND THEIR DEALERS HAVE STATED THAT AS OF NOV 18, 2019 THERE IS NO FIX AND THAT THEIR ENGINEERS ARE AWARE OF THE SITUATION. THIS LOOSE STEERING CAN ALSO BE SEEN IN THE PARKED STATIONARY POSITION BY SIMPLY TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL BETWEEN THE 11 O'CLOCK AND 1 O'CLOCK POSITIONS AND NOT SEEING THE FRONT WHEELS REACT OR MOVE AT ALL. I HAVE ONLY 455 TOTAL MILES ON THIS JEEP AND PER MY DEALERS INSTRUCTIONS I HAVE PARKED THE JEEP AS IT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE. FCA/JEEP WILL DO NOTHING AND ALSO DECLINED TO BUYBACK THE VEHICLE SO WE HAVE RETAINED LEGAL COUNSEL.
While driving on a couple occasions the traction control light kicked in and wouldn’t allow me to turn I had to come to almost a complete stop, I thought it had gone away and a few days later I had a death wobble that occurred on a very busy hwy and had to pull into the middle lane to prevent an accident. I could not let go completely of the wheel but I also couldn’t really control the vehicle I had to stop it. I was not turning when this one happened I was going straight I had already turned and drove straight for a few minutes before it happened. I was able to drive a quarter of a mile to the auto repair shop where it is sitting. He told me himself it is very dangerous to drive it when that occurs.
Coolant leaking, engine overheating, dealer says not covered issue despite it being a known issue (see customer satisfaction notification zd8 coolant leak. But dealership is going to charge me over five hundred dollars to replace a gasket and use some lock tight on my vehicle. I understand there isnt a RECALL on my vin in particular but I also can read and the narrative in the above mentioned notification matches my vehicle. 2021 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited 2.0 turbo engine. So why am I paying out of pocket for a "known" issue?
Transmission refuses to shift. Or will loose power and Have to pull off or just stop on the highway to shut vehicle off and restart to fix the problem. I was on i85 and had to pull off twice and the shoulder is a dangerous area to be on that highway. Also torque converter ticks and I’ve noticed a lot of the 2.0 4 cylinders having the same issues.
The following is copy of an email sent to JEEP CEO in November and then again in January. I have not received a response. I have also sent an email to the dealer. I ask NHTSA to look into  Dear Mr. [XXX] :   I would like your assistance in a major issue I am having with my 2021 Jeep Wrangler Sport.  I have contacted the dealer (Airpark Jeep- [XXX] ) and your corporate customer service department with both saying they are unable to help me.   As I am sure you know, social media has a lot of information on what is referred to as the Jeep Death Wobble- A problem with the stabilizer bar. My jeep has this issue and it hits mostly at highway speeds causing the entire jeep to shake violently until the jeep settles down.  This is now happening too many times and there is nothing the driver can do, but hold tight on the wheel and hope the shaking doesn't cause an accident.   I can not believe this was not addressed via a safety recall! This problem has the potential in my opinion to lead to serious injury or death of passengers in the jeep and others nearby!   I will be turning the jeep in at the end of February and I assume the dealer will have to fix the problem (I am told it takes a couple hours to replace the stabilizer bar), before the vehicle is sold as a used jeep.   To allow this condition to exist is inexcusable by both Jeep HQ and the local Jeep dealer.  Because this has been a known issue and Jeep and your dealers have done nothing to resolve this problem, I will not simply go away.  I and other jeep owners are owed something more than "We can't help".   I have owned two CJ-7s, one Grand Cherokee, and now my Wrangler Sport.  As part of a Sheriff's Search and Rescue Team, I am required to have a solid 4-wheel drive vehicle.  Based on this experience and a few other issues that were not resolved, I will now consider purchasing the Ford Bronco instead.   I would like the courtesy of a response please.   Thank you, [XXX]    [XXX] Deputy Director FBI NEIA INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)

I purchased my Jeep March 14th 2024  I purchased my Jeep as a buy back that had already been fixed. I purchased an additional 6000 warranty to be double protected. I received a letter from FCA on 10.18.2024 stating  the 95B recall letting me know my vehicle can catch on fire at anytime. They also have no fix for this issue. I want them to buy back my jeep due to this extremely dangerous recall and they refuse. I cannot begin to explain how unsafe I feel on a daily basis. This has given me extreme anxiety that I now have to take daily medication for. I think it’s criminal that they will not buy back my jeep! There has to be a class action lawsuit if not I’ll hire my own attorney. This is beyond criminal.
I have experience multiple episodes of the "death wobble"that previous 2021 Jeep Wrangler have reported over the past year. The steering wheel starts to wobble at times going over 60mph or hitting a bump. It appears that that the auto maker does not have an answer given the reports I have reviewed by NHTSA.

My jeep wrangler entire dashboard turned red flashing , lighting up that the coolant was way too high. This has happened twice and both times when contacting Jeep corporate it was the waterpump that went bad and now has been replaced twice. Jeep corporate thinks that it is fine to replace a water pump twice in less than a year and a half .  Now I have the death wobble where on the interstate at speeds over 60 miles an hour my steering wheel shakes like crazy making it hard to operate my 2021 wrangler unless I get under 60 miles per hour which is a risk for everyone on the road. When telling corporate about these issues. They have full documentation and they say well it’s covered under warranty.  Well warranty doesn’t last forever and I am scared for my safety and others.  Look at the reviews on Jeep corporate- none are good and talk continuously on water pump issues and death wobble problems . Please help me
NHTSA Recall 22V-767. This recall was issued in October 2022, and the manufacturer has failed to complete the recall on our vehicle. I have called and asked to have this recall completed and have told that there are no parts available, however, numerous online reports from owner groups across the country have said that the parts that ARE available are being used to fix vehicles on the lots that are in stop-sale first, instead of fixing customer's Jeeps. The recall is old and the problem is serious; it can cause a lot of damage when that part fails, and could result in an accident. My wife drives this Jeep daily, and I fear for her safety. FCA doesn't appear to be taking any of it seriously. What is NHTSA doing about this? There are a lot of us with the affected vehicles that are in this position.
Death wobble on my 2021 jeep wrangler after getting over a certain speed and hitting a bump it shakes violently
While driving on the Interstate at 70 mph I experienced a severe side-to-side shaking of the steering wheel.  This included the entire front-end of the vehicle shimmying and visibly vibrating.  If I didn't have a good grip on the steering wheel at the time, we would likely have crashed.  This appears to be the "death wobble" described in numerous online forums and subject of a previous recall on 2018 and 2019 Jeep Wrangler models.  Obviously, this problem still exists on 2021 models.  The event seems to be precipitated by any small bump or change in pavement such as passing over a bridge on the Interstate.  There was no prior warning of this event.  Total vehicle mileage is 8,700 miles and temperature was 39 degrees.  There are no modifications to the vehicle and it remains completely stock.  The wobble occurred repeatedly until I could get off the Interstate.
I was casually driving home from work in a 35 MPH zone on a standard road. When my 2021 jeep wranglers 4xe (30,000 miles exactly) ABS, and electronic brake stabilizer warning lights came on. I touched the brake and they were non-responsive. I then continued to press the brakes all the way to the floor multiple times and there was no response. I was able to pull the emergency brake to bring the vehicle to an immediate halt in the middle of the road and have a tow truck come ASAP. Service the next day said all the warning lights are gone and that they do not see any history of the errors. This issue posed extreme risk for myself and my pregnant wife. The car is still at the service specialist as i requested additional diagnosis be performed.
The Engine light came on 3 weeks ago and I took it to the auto shop to find out what is wrong. P1547 is the code that the auto mechanic told me was coming up on the scan. He said it could be the gas cap so I had that replaced, but the light came back on in 2 days.  He said that this is the 2nd Jeep Wrangler he has seen with the same engine light and code and believes it has something to do with the fuel system.  My Jeep is less than 3 years old and only has 22,556 miles on it. I have only driven it around town and on the highways. Have taken very good care of the vehicle and have replaced the oil as directed.  This has to be a manufacturers error and something that is quite concerning if it has to do with the fuel system.  Please advise on how to proceed.  I will be reaching out to Jeep corporate office as well to let them know about this issue and to see which service center they would like me to take the vehicle to.

The contact owns a 2021 Jeep Wrangler. The contact stated while reversing approximately 5 MPH down the driveway, the contact slowed and stopped to place the vehicle into drive and the vehicle stalled. The contact stated that the drive (D) light was flashing. The contact stated that she placed the vehicle in park (P), and several attempts were needed to restart the vehicle. The contact stated that the failure was intermittent but had occurred several times. On one occasion, the vehicle stalled while making a turn at an intersection. The contact stated that when the vehicle stalled, the vehicle was in “Electric Mode”. The contact had not taken the vehicle to a local dealer. The vehicle had not been diagnosed nor repaired. The contact stated that NHTSA Campaign Number: 22V865000 (Engine) repair was performed in 2022 and related the failure to the recall. The manufacturer had not been informed of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 18,000.
When driving over 50mph or above at highway speeds. When vehicle hits uneven or rough roadway. Violent shaking happens immediately Jeep websites call it the Death Wobble where, everything shakes really bad and is very stressful and scary.  When the vehicle slows down to under 30mph the violent shaking stops. We brought the vehicle to the Cocoa Fl, Boniface Hiers Chrysler and Jeep dealership to have repaired.  They made some adjustments the problem stopped for about 8 months. It has started doing the Death Wobble again. Have to take the vehicle back in to the dealership again.
The contact owns a 2021 Jeep Wrangler. The contact stated that while pulling into the parking space, the vehicle suddenly lunged forward crashing into the rear of a parked vehicle which then crashed into the rear of a second parked vehicle. The contact indicated that the vehicle lunged forward while the accelerator pedal was released in order to press the brake pedal. During the incident, no injuries were reported.  A police report was taken at the scene. The cause of the failure was not determined. The local dealer and manufacturer was notified of the failure. The failure mileage was 9,000.
The contact owns a 2021 Jeep Wrangler. The contact stated while driving 55 MPH over a bump in the roadway, the vehicle began to shake abnormally. The contact stated no warning light was illuminated. The contact stated he decelerated to 20 MPH and the vehicle stopped shaking. The contact experience the failure a total of 6 times. The contact called the local dealer and made them aware of the failure. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The contact took the vehicle to another local dealer; CR Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram of Adrian (1211 US-223, Adrian, MI 49221, 517-266-5900) where it was diagnosed with needing the stabilizer steering damper to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired due to the parts not being available. The manufacturer had been informed of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 20,000.
My 2021 Jeep Wrangler 4xe died while driving down the road. Luckily I was able to coast to the side and cycle the engine off/on in order to regain power. This was the exact same issue that is described in NHTSA Campaign Number: 22V865000, however, this time (2/3/23) was after the ZB7 recall was completed. Even after the recall work was completed and Jeep told me the vehicle was safe to drive, it still failed in the exact same manner. The recall procedure did not work and this vehicle is not safe to drive.   Additionally, during the period after the recall was completed and before it died again while driving, the battery range has decreased dramatically (less than 50% of what it was prior to the recall work).
When driving a faster speeds if I hit a bump  my car starts shaking rapidly feeling like my tires are gonna fall off and doesn’t stop until I pull over, took it to the dealer while under warranty and they told me there was nothing they could do about it or find the issue
On the interstate, my Jeep developed the "death wobble" causing us to have to greatly decrease speed among other drivers.  This issue continued after each small bump in the road that we hit at interstate speeds, causing the vehicle to shake violently and requiring me to decrease speed repeatedly among other fast-moving traffic.  It eventually required me to have to move over to the slow lane for easy road departure if needed.  After an attempted repair with a steering damper at the dealer, the issue returned 1.5 weeks later, and after 2 weeks, my vehicle remains at the dealer while they try to figure out how to correct this dangerous issue.
This Jeep is unsafe.    The jeep has a problem when you are driving 70 miles per hour on the highway.   If you go over a bridge with road bumps or hit a pothole, the Jeep goes into an uncontrollable wobble.    I have to slow down to about 40 miles per hour to get the Jeep to stabilize.    Suddenly needing to slow down because the jeep feels like it will shake itself apart is incredibly dangerous.    We tried to have it fixed at a dealer in Vermont and they said it was fixed but it isn't.   I took it to the dealer in Albany NY today where we bought the Jeep and it happened again on the way.    They tell me that it might take up to 2 months to get a part - a steering dampener - to fix the problem.     This car is unsafe.   How can there not be a recall on this issue?
I was driving home from a trip to the store. I stopped at a red light and all of the sudden I got a message that traction control failed, service charging system, and power train failure occurred. I had no power to move the car and the brakes barely worked. It told me to put it in park and restart the Jeep. I was able to roll downhill to the median out of traffic and put it in park and restart it. It seemed to work normally until I went another mile or so and it happened again. This time I was in motion and had a very difficult time stopping in the middle of traffic to put the Jeep in park and restart. This is a VERY serious problem and I’m very lucky it didn’t happen on the interstate. I am a member of two Jeep 4xe groups on Facebook and this is a reoccurring issue that is extremely dangerous.
While driving my vehicle and going about 30-40mph, the dashboard began flashing and telling me there was a charging system failure. At that point I could no longer accelerate and the "D" light on the gear shift was blinking. After putting the car in park, it would not allow me to change the shift gear to a different position. The Jeep app on my phone alerted me that my vehicle could not charge which was strange because I was driving and not charging at all. I had to pull over in the middle of a very busy intersection and turn off my car and turn it back on just to get it going again. When I turned it on, everything was back to normal and I was able to drive. This is very dangerous and luckily I was not on the highway and going 60mph when this happened or it could have been catastrophic.
3/7 7:50 AM Jeep driving in electric mode and slowly pulling up to a stop light.  Jeep started beeping and threw an error about shutting down and immediately stopped on its own in traffic.  Turned Jeep off and on to continue driving.  3/5 approx 10:00 AM.  Jeep idling in parking lot for approximately 20 minutes in e-save battery charge mode.  Jeep turned off with a charge fault error.
Steering wanders. Vehicle will wobble at high speeds. Vehicle pulls to the right when you release the wheel. Vehicle requires constant steering input, these inputs are unpredictable. Dealership refuses to work on the vehicle “that’s just how these handle”. This issue has existed from the date of pick up, and been to the dealership twice.
I was driving normally along a busy road at 40mph. Suddenly, the car stalled and I could not accelerate. I coasted until it completely stopped in the middle of a busy road. I was unable to move the car, and instead had to put the car in park and turn off the engine. The "D" light on the gear shifter was blinking, and then the battery on the car went from 55% charge down to 47% charge. A red lightning bolt emergency sign came on but then went off immediately after. With the car off in the middle of the road, I restarted it hoping for the best. Luckily, it did restart fine and I could continue driving. However, I have heard on Jeep 4xe forums that this is an issue with many other owners, some even happening on the interstates. I am now too afraid to drive this car with my child or for long distances, because this issue was completely spontaneous and unpredictable. I took it to the dealer to be serviced, but they are unsure what is going on. And as a side note, this is a brand new car (2021 year) with 105 miles. I only had it for FIVE days before this happened. Prior to this incident I also noticed that the charge would not hold very long at all - for example, driving it today 3.4 miles from one point to the dealer, the charge went from 47% to 17% - this should not be normal. Overall this issue is unacceptable and this needs to be addressed immediately before people die. Thanks for your consideration.
On 9/16/21, my vehicle dangerously lost power, following a very loud sound and a violent shudder. Power for braking and steering was lost. The vehicle had no response to the accelerator pedal. I attempted to coast to the shoulder of the road, when the vehicle slammed into park on its own while still traveling at roughly 15mph. The wheels locked and the vehicle came to a violent stop by itself, likely not activating the brake lights. The cooling fans came on at full speed, climate control cancelled itself, and the vehicle locked in park. While using the built in emergency button, the vehicle telematics shut down and dropped the dispatcher. I completed the emergency service call using my phone. The vehicle was towed to the dealer, initial reports are that it is not drivable, the main hybrid battery pack fuses are blown. The prior night, the vehicle failed to charge using the Jeep EVSE cable.
Pulled out of parking lot and into street.  Several different warnings came on and the vehicle stopped on its on and became totally unresponsive in the middle of the street.  Warnings included E-drive charging fault, check engine, shift error, among many others.  Car push button would not allow the car to turn off.
The backup camera does not work at different times. Local dealership said it was a common issue and should resolve itself in an hour.
ONLY 500 MILES ON VEHICLE, WENT OFF-ROADING FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WITHIN A SHORT TIME AFTER CLIMBING A STEEP HILL, SMOKE CAME FROM UNDER VEHICLE AND CLUTCH WENT TO FLOOR AND STAYED. TURNED JEEP OFF, PUMPED CLUTCH WHICH SEEMED FINE BUT SMOKE CONTINUED FOR A MINUTE. WENT UNDER VEHICLE AFTER SMOKE STOPPED AND SAW BURNT FIBERS COMING OUT FROM TRANSMISSION CASE. RESTARTED VEHICLE AND NO MOVEMENT. TOWED JEEP OUT TO HOME. JEEP ROADSIDE TOOK IT TO DEALERSHIP. APPARENTLY THE CLUTCH SWITCH PLATE OVERHEATED, FLASHED, AND COMPLETELY BURNED AWAY! THERE'S A RECALL I WAS UNAWARE OF BUT NOW 500 MILES ON BRAND NEW JEEP AND CLUTCH PLATE, PRESSURE PLATE, ETC MUST BE REPLACED.    JEEP IS AT TATE BRANCH JEEP IN CARLSBAD NM WHERE THEY CAN GIVE DETAILS ON DAMAGE.

I have a 2022 Wrangler 4xe.  This weekend I rear ended a car in stop and go traffic.  When I used the brake it actually felt like the car jumped forward a bit. I had to stomp on the brake pedal again as if my first attempt had no grab.  More details...I was in hybrid mode with <1% battery status and max regen was on.  I was going less than 10 miles an hour.  Jeep has a max regeneration function that uses the engine to generate an EV battery recharge.  I understand that the max regen sort of turns off when you are rolling at really low speeds, but it seems the transition to/from this is rough on the transmission or something. This only happens at low speeds (in parking lots, etc)  This behavior happens intermittently but, this is the first time I was not able to stop completely before an impact occured.

I was slowly pulling into a parking spot and slowly removed my foot from the break with the jeep catapulted forward nearly hitting the car parked alongside.  Had to hit the brakes so hard, tires screeched.  It happened again several more times while slowing down or stopped at intersections.  Have had to hit the brakes with both feet almost standing on brake.  No warning or notifications.  It feels almost as if accelerator has more power than brake.
Jeep TSB S2008000158  This service bulletin is exactly that happened to my jeep but because it is a 2022 jeep that will not honor the service bulletin. This has happened to me twice, once in my garage and another time driving and the jeep just stopped in the middle of the street. Both times have been taken into the Jeep dealership.
The contact owns a 2022 Jeep Wrangler. The contact stated while driving at an undisclosed speed, the vehicle shook excessively. The failure was described as the death wobble. The vehicle was taken to the dealer however, the failure could not be duplicated. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired by an independent mechanic or dealer. The contact stated that an appointment was scheduled for a diagnostic test. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure and several cases were filed. The failure mileage was approximately 6,000.
On the evening of August 19 I was returning to Katy Texas from a trip to Austin Texas.  About half way home the Axle Locker Fault indicator light came on along with a blinking rear axle fault indicator.   Just east of Sealy Texas on 1-10 I heard a clunk and saw smoke pour out from underneath the back of the jeep.  I also lost forward momentum and had to make my way over from the far left lane 3 lanes to the emergency lane without power.   I was fortunate to be near an exit and was able to roll off onto the feeder and into grassy area off the road.  With a loss of power in heavy traffic this could have caused a fatal accident.  The jeep, which is slightly over a year old was towed by AAA to my house.  On Monday Jeep was called who towed it to autonation at 21777 katy freeway.  They analyzed the problem and it was a broken pinion gear in the differential.  The rear differential had been replaced by the dealer in March due to the same warning lights from the axel position sensor.  As of the submittal of this report, the jeep is at the dealer waiting for an axle replacement.
The contact owns a 2022 Jeep Wrangler. The contact stated while driving approximately 60 MPH, the vehicle experienced the death wobble while driving over bumps on the highway. No warning lights were illuminated. The contact made a local dealer aware of the failure when the vehicle was previously taken in for recall repairs; however, the failure could not be duplicated. The vehicle was not repaired. The contact stated that the failure was recurring when driving over bumps at highway speeds. The vehicle was then taken back to the dealer, where it was diagnosed that the steering damper needed to be replaced. The vehicle was repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 8,000.
The steering becomes lose when hitting small bumps at highway speeds.  Vehicle must be slowed below speed limit in order to regain control.
Rear window glass exploded out of no where
The Wrangler accelerated while doing regenerative braking or while my foot was on the brake. This caused it to hit a building. It is available for inspection. My safety and my child's safety was put at risk when contact was made with a building. Those inside the building were also at risk. The  problem has not been reproduced yet as the incident just happened. The vehicle was towed to a dealer. Insurance will be inspecting. Police were called to scene of accident. I will file a claim with Jeep as well. I was running it in full electric mode and I don't remember any issues. The vehicle was just re wired as well.
ABS Module short circuit,  I am aware of the current recall in effect for 2011 Hyundai Elantra's but it should be noted that my vehicle also has the same issue, short circuit causing the ABS motor to run constantly. Issue was discovered by mechanic, I opted to disconnect the ABS module, as replacement is unaffordable.  Is there any plan to expand the recall to include my vehicle?
My Daughter was driving the car and thought it felt "wobbly", she arrived at my home and  parked on the driveway.  When she went to move her car, the steering wheel no longer worked.  The steering wheel just spins in circles around and around without any resistance.  The front wheels do not move when the wheel is being turned.  I have a video but it is too large to submit
I pulled up to my house, turned the ignition off, and the airbag deployed in my face.
The contact owns a 2010 Hyundai Elantra. The contact stated that the battery became inoperable overnight. There were five unknown instrument cluster warning indicator lights illuminated. The contact called the local dealer, but the vehicle was not diagnosed nor repaired. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was 65,000.
THIS CAR HAS A DEFECT IN STEERING COLUMN THAT IS WELL KNOWN TO HYUNDAI,THE DEFECT IS CAUSED BY A SUBSTANDARD RUBBER BUSHING  THAT HAS DETERIORATED AND FALLEN OUT OF A UNIVERSAL JOINT IN STEERING MECHANISM,EACH TIME THE STEERING IS TURNED EITHER WAY THERE IS PLAY AND A CLUNKING NOISE,I DON'T KNOW IF IT HAS CAUSED ANY ACCIDENTS OR NOT BUT ANY DEFECT IN STEERING IS SOMETHING ALL DRIVERS SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT,AS FOR MYSELF I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED WHEN DRIVING KNOWING THAT SOMETHING IS MISSING FROM STEERING MECHANISM
WE RECEIVED A LETTER IN REGARDS TO A SAFETY RECALL ON THE 2010 ELANTRA. WE OWN TWO OF THIS VEHICLE. I CONTACTED HUNTINGTON HYUNDAI, IN HUNTINGTON, N.Y. TO SCHEDULE THE REPAIR.  AS PER JOE SANTIAGO WHO ANSWERED, THEY ARE NOT TAKING APPOINTMENTS FOR THIS REPAIR, AND WILL ONLY BE ACCEPTING VEHICLES ON A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS MONDAY - FRIDAY 9 AM - 5 PM.  IT WAS EXPLAINED THAT WE MAY HAVE TO COME BACK MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE THE VEHICLE IS ACCEPTED FOR REPAIR.  AS A FIRST RES PONDER I AM STILL WORKING DURING THE OUTBREAK AND WILL BE UNABLE TO TAKE MULTIPLE DAYS OFF FROM WORK TO "TRY" TO GET THE CAR IN.   THEY WERE VERY UNHELPFUL AND UNNECESSARILY RUDE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CONVERSATION.
MY 2010 HYUNDAI ELANTRA'S STEERING WHEEL STARTED CLICKING. SHORTLY THEREAFTER THE EPS LIGHT TURNS ON. I WAS WORKING AND COULD NOT TAKE IT IN. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT A FEW DAYS LATER AND ON MY WAY MY CAR STARTED LOCKING WHILE STEERING ALMOST CAUSING ME TO HIT A PARKED CAR. MY DEALERSHIP TOLD ME NOTHING IS COVERED. I HAVE READ NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE.
THIS LIGHT CAME OF SHORTLY AFTER PURCHASING THE CAR AND AFTER 15 MINS OF DRIVING IT EVERYTIME SEEMS TO CONE UP IVE TRIED PRESSING THE OFF BUTTON FOR IT BUT THAT DOESNT WORK THE CAR SEEMS TO STEER ITSELF AT TIMES ALONG WITH OCCASIONAL BREAK PROBLEMS... I TRIED TO ANSWER YES TO IT HAD BEEN IN A WRECK BUT DIDNT KNOW ANY OF THE REQUIRED INFORMATION FOLLOWING THAT BECAUSE I DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE WRECK SINCE IT HAPPENED DURING THE POSSESION OF ITS PREVIOUS OWNER ALL I WAS TOLD IS THAT IT HAD BEEN IN A WRECK DURING PURCHASE
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 HYUNDAI ELANTRA. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 40 MPH, THE POWER STEERING ASSIST SUDDENLY MALFUNCTIONED AND THE DRIVER WAS UNABLE TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL. AS A RESULT, THE CONTACT'S VEHICLE REAR ENDED A SECOND VEHICLE BEFORE CRASHING INTO A UTILITY POLE. THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. THE DRIVER SUSTAINED CHEST AND NECK INJURIES AND THE FRONT PASSENGER SUSTAINED INJURIES TO THE RIGHT HAND AND HEAD. MEDICAL ATTENTION WAS RECEIVED. A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE CONTACT'S HOME. THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS NOT DETERMINED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE LOCAL DEALER WAS NOT NOTIFIED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 180,000.
2010 ELANTRA HAS 37,000 MILES. I'VE HAD THREE EPISODES (ONE WITH MY 16 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER DRIVING) WHERE THE POWER STEERING GOES OUT WHILE DRIVING AT SLOW SPEED ON CITY STREET. NO PRIOR INCIDENT KNOWN TO CREATE THE CONDITION. THUS FAR, ONLY WAY TO FIX PROBLEM IS TO TURN CAR OFF AND RESTART. NOT VERY SAFE. LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED I HAD STRUGGLE TO DRIVE THE CAR INTO A NEARBY PARKING LOT TO SAFELY TURN IT OFF AND RESTART.
WHILE IN HEAVY, SLOW MOVING TRAFFIC, A CAR STOPPED ABRUPTLY IN FRONT OF ME. I SLAMMED ON MY BRAKES BUT MY CAR SEEMED TO ACCELERATE. I HAD LEFT SPACE BETWEEN OUR VEHICLES BUT THE CAR KEPT MOVING FORWARD AND I HIT THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME CAUSING SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS OF DAMAGE.  THIS IS THE SECOND OCCURRENCE.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 HYUNDAI ELANTRA. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 35 MPH, THE STEERING WHEEL INADVERTENTLY SHOOK VIOLENTLY AND BECAME DIFFICULT TO MANEUVER. THE FAILURE RECURRED A FEW TIMES. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 127,000.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 HYUNDAI ELANTRA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE ALARM RANDOMLY ACTIVATED WITHOUT WARNING. AT TIMES, THE TRANSMITTER/FOB FAILED TO FUNCTION PROPERLY. IN ADDITION, THE FUNCTION BUTTON WAS USED TO OPEN THE TRUNK OF THE VEHICLE AND IT DRAINED THE BATTERY TO THE POINT THAT THE VEHICLE WAS UNABLE TO BE DRIVEN. THE CONTACT HAD TO HAVE THE BATTERY RECHARGED. THE DEALER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. UPON TAKING THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER MORE THAN ONCE, THEY WERE UNABLE TO REPLICATE AND DIAGNOSE THE VEHICLE. THE FAILURE CONTINUED TO THE POINT THAT THE VEHICLE ALSO RANDOMLY FAILED TO START AND THE CONTACT HAD TO MAKE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS NOT AVAILABLE.
AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY IN A HEAD-ON COLLISION.  ANOTHER DRIVER WAS TRAVELLING TOO FAST ON SNOW AND SLID INTO MY LANE WHILE I WAS TRAVELING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.  HIS AIRBAG DEPLOYED, MINE DID NOT.  THIS WAS A 6 AIRBAG SYSTEM, WITH NO PASSENGERS IN CAR.  I NEED ASSISTANCE PULLING OUT THE EVENT DATA RECORDER AND CRASH DATA BEFORE THIS CAR IS SALVAGED SO WE CAN GET HYUNDAI TO RECALL THIS SYSTEM.
MY WIFE OWNS A 2010 HYUNDAI ELANTRA AND THE COMPLAINT I'VE GOT IS ABOUT THE LUG NUTS. I HAD TO REPLACE THE REAR BRAKE PADS, BRAKE SHOES AND ROTORS. THE FIRST PROBLEM I RAN INTO ON THIS PROJECT WAS THAT THE LUG NUTS WERE SO RUSTED THAT THE LUG WRENCH SUPPLIED WITH THE CAR WOULDN'T FIT OVER THEM - THE CHROME PLATING ON THE NUTS HAD DETERIORATED ALLOWING RUST TO BUILT UP UNDERNEATH THE PLATING SO THAT THE WRENCH WOULDN'T FIT. (I THOUGHT OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD TO CHANGE FLAT TIRES ON THE ROAD AND WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET THE FLAT TIRES OFF.) I CALLED THE DEALER TO SEE IF NEW LUG NUTS WERE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY BUT THEY SAID NO, THAT THEY'D GIVE ME A 'DEAL' OF $10/NUT - AROUND $200 TO REPLACE ALL THEM ON THE CAR! I STILL HAVE THE RUSTED LUG NUTS ON THE CAR BUT CARRY AN ADDITIONAL WRENCH THAT WILL FIT OVER THEM. I DID MANAGE TO REPLACE ALL THE PARTS, INCLUDING RUSTED AND WARPED ROTORS MENTIONED IN SOME OF THE OTHER COMPLAINTS I'VE SEEN BUT CAUTION ANYONE WHO PLANS TO TACKLE THIS JOB TO BE PREPARED FOR A GRUELING JOB.
MY DAUGHTER WAS RETURNING HOME FROM WORK.  THE EPS (ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING) LIGHT AND THE ESC LIGHT CAME ON.  INDICATING THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE STEERING.  SHE PULLED THE CAR OFF THE ROAD IN A PANIC AND CALLED ME.  I TOLD HER TO GET THE CAR TO AN AUTO ZONE OR ADVANCED AUTO AND HAVE THEM CHECK THE FLUID AND THAT IN THE INTERIM THE STEERING MAY GET VERY HARD AND TO BE CAREFUL.  SHE GOT IT TO ADVANCE AUTO AND WAS INFORMED THERE IS NO FLUID BECAUSE IT IS ELECTRONIC AND SHE NEEDED TO GET IT TO THE DEALER.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER (GETTEL HYUNDAI IN SARASOTA) AND WAS TOLD THE COUPLER WAS OUT BUT THAT THE CAR WAS STILL SAFE TO DRIVE AND THE LIGHTS WOULD JUST STAY ON OR I COULD PAY $1500 TO HAVE A NEW STEERING COLUMN INSTALLED.  THE STEERING WHEEL WAS MAKING A CLUNKING NOISE AS I WAS DRIVING IT THERE AND I WAS HOLD THE STEERING WHEEL SO TIGHT MY FOREARMS WERE SORE BY THE TIME I GOT IT THERE.  I AM STILL UNDER THE 5 YEAR WARRANTY (BUT NOT THE MILEAGE).  I IMMEDIATELY CHECK FOR RECALLS ON NHTSA AND DISCOVER THERE IS A RECALL FOR THIS VERY THING.  BY THIS TIME THE DEALER WAS CLOSED.  CONTACTED THEM FIRST THING IN THE MORNING (TODAY) AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO RECALL AND THAT THE CAR WAS SAFE TO DRIVE WITH THE DEFECTIVE STEERING!  THIS IS NOT SOME SORT OF COSMETIC PROBLEM!!  HOW CAN A CAR BE SAFE TO DRIVE WITH DEFECTIVE STEERING?  WHY ARE THEY NOT HONORING THE RECALL?  WE LIVE IN THE COUNTRY AND WE TRAVERSE WINDY ROADS...IF THE STEERING DOES ACTUALLY GO OUT IT COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT AND POSSIBLY A FATALITY!  IN THE MEAN TIME MY CAR SITS AT THE DEALERSHIP AND WE HAVE NO TRANSPORTATION TO GET BACK AND FORTH TO WORK OR FOR ANY EMERGENCY THAT SHOULD OCCUR!!!  *TR
TL*  THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 HYUNDAI ELANTRA TOURING.  WHILE DRIVING 25 MPH, THE ESC AND EPS INDICATORS ILLUMINATED ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL.  THE DEALER STATED THAT THE STOP LAMP SWITCH NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED, BUT THE FAILURE RECURRED.  THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED.  THE VIN WAS UNAVAILABLE.  THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 44,000.
DRIVING ELANTRA TOURING 2010 ( WITH LESS THAN 28500 MILES) IN A LOCAL STREET, AND ALL OF SUDDEN THE VEHICLE STOPPED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE TURN SIGNAL AND UNABLE TO OPERATE THE STEERING. THERE WERE SEVERAL LIGHTS, INCLUDING THE "ESC" WAS ON.     IT IS REALLY SCARY  WHEN VEHICLE STOPPED RESPONDING WHILE  DRIVING ON THE STREET. I AM NOT SURE ANY RECALL AVAILABLE TO REMEDIATE THIS DANGEROUS PROBLEM.  *TR
TRAVELING IN A 40 MPH ZONE APPROACHING A RED LIGHT.  BEGAN DECELERATING AND APPLYING BRAKE.  EPS (ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING) LIGHT AND ESC LIGHTS ACTIVATED ON DASHBOARD; COMPLETE LOSS OF POWER STEERING OCCURRED.  SHUT  OFF VEHICLE & CHECKED ALL FUSES - ALL APPEARED NORMAL; NO  POWER STEERING OR ESC FUNCTIONING.    VEHICLE SERVICED BY DEALER WHO DIAGNOSED A SHORT IN THE ELECTRICAL HARNESS IN THE STEERING COLUMN.  REPAIR REQUIRED COMPLETE REPLACEMENT OF STEERING COLUMN AND WIRING HARNESS (PARTS COST WAS OVER $1,100.00).      DEALER STATED THIS IS BECOMING A COMMON REPAIR FOR THE ELANTRA LINE OF VEHICLES, BUT THIS WAS THE FIRST THEY SAW IN A TOURING MODEL. DUE TO COMMONALITY OF PARTS IN COMPARISON TO THE PERCENTAGE OF TOURING MODELS PRODUCED IT APPEARS THERE MAY BE A PROBLEM WITH THE DESIGN OF THE STEERING COLUMN AND WIRING HARNESS FOR ALL ELANTRA MODELS.  *TR
TL*  THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 HYUNDAI ELANTRA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE ANTI-THEFT ALARM BEGAN TO SOUND INDEPENDENTLY AND WITHOUT WARRANT. THE CONTACT WAS ABLE TO TURN THE ALARM OFF BY ACTIVATING THE KEYLESS REMOTE SENSOR. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT TAKEN TO THE DEALER FOR INSPECTION OF ANY POSSIBLE FAILURES. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 43,000 AND THE CURRENT MILEAGE 100,000.
I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AND WAS CUT OFF BY ANOTHER CAR.  I WAS TRAVELLING ABOUT 50MPH,  I PROCEEDED TO BRAKE (DID NOT REQUIRE HARD BRAKING, BECAUSE ME SPEED WAS NOT HIGH)  AND STEER TO THE RIGHT TO AVOID HITTING THE RIGHT SIDE  OF THE CAR THAT CUT ME OFF.  MY CAR OVER COMPENSATED AND  PROCEEDED TO SWERVE.  IT TOOK A LOT TO REGAIN CONTROL.  MY INITIAL STEER TO AVOID THE CAR IN FRONT WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO SWERVE OUT OF CONTROL.  I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS WITH OTHER VEHICLES THAT I HAVE DRIVEN AND THIS EXPERIENCE WAS RATHER FRIGHTENING.
WATER LEAKS FROM WINDSHIELD AREA INTO BEHIND DASHBOARD AND ACCUMULATES ON FLOOR MATS(FRONT AREA).     FRONT RIGHT WHEEL SCRAPING NOISE. ALREADY REPLACED TIRE, PREMATURE TIRE FAILURE.     HEATER CONTROL LIGHTS TURNS OFF.  *TR
UnKnown. When financing the vehicle through Adonis Auto Group I was unaware of the unrepaired safety  recall. Also I am under the impression nothing was done to the car before purchasing it, I have had to make repairs to the car only after 10,000 - 15,000 miles of driving. For example replacing the control arm, axle, brake hardware. My point is they are selling cars without repairing them and not advising the customer upon purchase. I also asked for the repair paperwork for what has been done to the car before purchase and never received it.
We received notice from Hyundai in mid-November about the anti-lock brake system modules problem (could leak brake fluid internally and cause an electrical short over time. This increases the risk of an engine compartment fire while parked or driving) There is still no date for fixing this problem. We now need to park this car outside our garage, which increases the risk of the car being stolen.

AWOKE TO GARAGE FIRE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 04/27/2020. HYUNDAI ON MY LIFT FOR REPAIRS .  UPON CLEARING THE DEBRIS, THERE WAS A HOLE/HOT SPOT  IN THE CONCRETE WHERE THE CAR WAS FOUND.  TOTAL LOSS OF 2011 HYUNDAI,OF MY BUILDING & MY SHOP EQUIPMENT.  THE CAUSE OF FIRE WAS UNDETERMINED BY THE MAINE STATE FIRE MARSHALL'S OFFICE.  *TR
WHEN GOING OVER BUMPS IN THE ROAD, ESPECIALLY AT HIGHER SPEEDS, 50-70 MPH, THE CAR FEELS LIKE IT LOSES CONTACT WITH ROAD SURFACE.  MAKING IT FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE LOST CONTROL OF THE CAR.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNED A 2011 HYUNDAI ELANTRA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE CAUGHT FIRE WHILE PARKED IN THE FAMILY GARAGE. THERE WERE NO INJURIES AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PUT OUT FIRE. A FIRE REPORT AND A POLICE REPORT WERE FILED. SMOKE FILLED THE HOME AND THE GARAGE DRYWALL CEILING HAD COLLAPSED AND BLACKENED THE INTERIOR OF THE GARAGE. THERE WAS EXTENSIVE SMOKE DAMAGE TO THE INTERIOR OF THE HOUSE. THE VEHICLE WAS ENGULFED IN FLAMES AND FULL OF WATER. THE FIRE STARTED ON THE DRIVER'S FRONT SIDE OF THE ENGINE. THE EXACT CAUSE HAD NOT BEEN DETERMINED AS OF YET. THE VEHICLE 'S WHOLE FRONT FROM THE ENGINE HAD BEEN BURNED OUT. THE GLASS EXPLODED AND THE VEHICLE WAS RIPPED OPEN USING A JAWS OF LIFE TOOL SO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT COULD PUT OUT THE FIRE FROM THE ENGINE. THE VEHICLE WAS DESTROYED. THE DEALER AND THE MANUFACTURER WERE NOT CONTACTED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE 68,000.
KNOWN HYUNDAI ENGINE PROBLEMS     THE ENGINE HAS A TICKING NOISE THAT I HAVE FOUND TO BE A MANUFACTURED ISSUE IN HYUNDAI ELANTRAS. THE CAMSHAFT BUSHINGS ARE WORN AWAY AND NEEDS A COMPLETELY NEW ENGINE. ALL OF WHICH IS A MANUFACTURING FAULT. THE TICKING IS AUDIBLE WHEN IDLING AND EVEN MORE SO WHEN THE ACCELERATOR IS PUSHED.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HYUNDAI ELANTRA. WHILE DRIVING AT AN UNKNOWN SPEED, THE CONTACT HEARD A RUBBING SOUND COMING FROM THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO HYUNDAI OF VACAVILLE (641 ORANGE DR, VACAVILLE, CA 95687, (866) 994-8186) WHO STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT INCLUDED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 15V629000 (SUSPENSION). THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 88,000.
THE CAR MAKES A REALLY BAD TICKING NOISE IN WHEN I CAME TO AN COMPLETE STOP THE ENGINE STALLED IN IT KINDA JUMPED LIKE IT DIDN'T WANT TO GO I'M SO AFRAID OF THE CAR JUS COMPLETELY NOT WORKING ANYMORE IN I DRIVE EVERYDAY WITH MY KIDS THIS IS REALLY A SAD THING HYUNDAI HAS TO KNOW THESE ENGINES ARE BAD.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HYUNDAI ELANTRA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE AIR BAG WARNING INDICATOR HAD BEEN ILLUMINATED SINCE OCTOBER 2, 2014. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO ACTION HYUNDAI IN MILLVILLE, NEW JERSEY WHERE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE VEHICLE EXCEEDED THE ALLOWABLE MILEAGE TO HAVE THE REPAIRS PERFORMED FOR FREE. THE VEHICLE WAS NEVER REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 108,000.
WHILE I WAS DRIVING, THE CAR STALLED. THE TACH READING DROPED TO ZERO, AND ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON. I TRIED RESTARTING MY CAR. I COULD DRIVE SLOWLY, BUT THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS STILL ON, AND THE TACH READING WAS STILL ZERO.    THIS HAPPENED FOR A FEW TIMES --- WHEN I DROVE ON HIGHWAY, ON A LOCAL STREET, AND WHEN I WAITED FOR A LONG LIGHT. IF STARTING AFTER A LONG ENOUGH REST, THOSE SYMPTOMS MIGHT DISAPPEAR TEMPORARILY.
OIL LEAKED FROM THE CRANKCASE SEAL WHILE DRIVING.  A MECHANIC REPLACED THE SEAL, WHICH FAILED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY.  THERE ARE METAL FRAGMENTS IN THE FRESH OIL.
IN THE LAST YEAR THE MPG HAS DROPPED DRASTICALLY. WHEN PURCHASED IN 2011 (ELANTRA LIMITED), I GOT 35 MPG.  IN THE LAST MONTH, I'M GETTING 16.9-20.9 MPG. MY CAR HAS BEEN IN FOR THE SCHEDULED RECALLS, BUT NOTHING WAS DETECTED. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE NOT NOTIFIED OF ANY SUCH PROBLEM.
THE REV LIGHT COMES ON AND MY CAR LOSES POWER. I HAVE TEKEN IT TWICE TO AN AUTHORIZED HYUNDAI DEALER, AND IT IS STILL NOT FIXED
I SAW A RECALL FOR A CAR I TRADED IN.  WILL THE NEW OWNER RECEIVE A NOTICE?
MY VEHICLE WILL NOT START. IT HAPPENS ON NUMEROUS OCCASSIONS AND I HAVE TO TRY SEVERAL ATTEMPTS BEFORE MY VEHICLE WILL START. I TOOK THE CAR IN TO BE CHECK AND EVERYTHING TESTED FINE. NO LIGHTS ON THE DASHBOARD INDICATED AN ERROR AND NO CODES COULD BE DETECTED. NOT SURE WHAT IS GOING ON BUT I HAVE A INFANT CHILD AND I CANNOT BE SOMEWHERE OR TRYING TO GO SOMEWHERE ESPECIALLY IF THERE IS AN EMERGENCY WITH MY CHILD AND MY VEHICLE REFUSES TO START AND YET ALL THE LIGHTS COME ON HOWEEVER MY ENGINE WOULD NOT START UPON TURNING MY KEY WHILE IN THE IGNITION. PLEASE FIX BECAUSE I SAW ON YOUTUBE AND OTHER FORUMS OF THIS SAME COMPLAINT AND I AM SURE HYUNDAI IS AWARE OF THESE COMPLAINTS BUT ARE FAILING TO DO SOMETHING AND THIS CAN BECOME A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN. PLEASE ADDRESS!!! 2011 HYUNDAI ELANTRA
I WAS INVOLVED IN A CRASH WHERE I  WAS HIT BY ANOTHER VEHICLE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE FRONT FENDER AND THEN WAS SPUN AROUND AND HIT THE BACK OF THE OTHER VEHICLE ON THE REAR PASSENGER QUARTER PANEL, THEN JUMPED THE CURB AND HIT A TREE. NONE OF THE AIR BAGS DEPLOYED. I HIT MY HEAD ON THE WINDOW OR THE CENTER POST, NOT SURE. THE VEHICLE THAT HIT ME WAS TRAVELING AT APPROXIMATELY 30-40 MPH.  *TR
IN LATE NOVEMBER THE TIRE PRESSURE INDICATOR CAME ON. I PUMPED UP THE TIRE. IT CAME BACK ON AGAIN SEVERAL DAYS LATER. THE CAR HAS MICHELIN ALL SEASON RADIALS THAT I HAD INSTALLED IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR. I ASSUMED THAT I HAD PICKED UP A NAIL OR SOMETHING SIMILAR, SO I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO SAM'S CLUB TO HAVE THE TIRE REPAIRED.  I WAS TOLD THEY HAD BAD NEWS AND BAD NEWS. THE WORST WAS THAT THEY COULD NOR REPAIR IT, BECAUSE THE RIM IS CRACKED! THEY SHOWED THE WHEEL TO ME. THE CRACK IS ON THE INSIDE RIM AND THERE IS NO OTHER EVIDENCE OF DAMAGE. I HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH FAILURE ANALYSIS. THIS APPEARS TO BE A STRESS FACTURE, POSSIBLY THE RESULT OF A MATERIALS DEFECT OR A DESIGN FLAW. (THIS IS A EXTREMELY LOW PROFILE 17' WHEEL/TIRE COMBINATION.) OTHER BAD NEWS? NO SPARE.
SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR LATE FEB. 2011 (AFTER THEY RELEASE THE NEW MODELED CARS IN THE LAST DAYS OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR)...I HAVE COMPLAINED AND INQUIRED ABOUT AN OCCURRENCE THAT HAPPENS WITH THE BRAKES ON OCCASION THAT SEEMS TO BE TRIGGERING:  VSM, ESC, TCS, ABS, BRAKE ASSIST AND/OR EBD SAFETY SYSTEMS UNDER NORMAL ROAD, TEMPERATURES, SPEEDS, BRAKE PRESSURE. THERE HAS BEEN AT BRAKE DELAYS, VERY LOUD GRINDING NOISE, AND AT TIMES PROVIDED A VIOLENT PUSH BACK AND PUMPING UNLIKE ANY NORMAL ABS SYSTEM AND THOSE TIMES WERE FEW BUT AGAIN UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS NO SUDDEN BREAKING. THE GRINDING SOUNDS AND FEELS A BIT LIKE A SECOND AFTER YOU APPLY PRESSURE TO THE BRAKE AN ANCHOR DROPS ON THE ROAD AND BOUNCES AND GRINDS AGAINST MENTAL AND THE PAVEMENT. IT FEELS LIKE AN EMPTY BRAKE PAD (BUT IS NOT) AND STOP AS IF ONE ALSO. HOWEVER NOT ALL THE TIME AND WHEN THE BRAKES ARE NORMAL IT FEELS SAFE. HOWEVER, IT HAPPENS EVEN SLOWLY PARKING IN MY FLAT SMOOTH DRIVEWAY SOMETIMES (NO SAND I CHECK EVERYTIME). I HAVE AVOIDED MANY ACCIDENTS JUST BARELY WHEN THIS IS TRIGGERED AND IT MOST OFTEN CAUSING DOUBLE THE STOPPING TIME. I END UP INTO THE INTERSECTING STREETS BEYOND A STOP SIGN OR STOP LIGHT BY ABOUT HALF A CAR LENGTH. IT DOESN'T ALWAYS KICK IN RIGHT AWAY WITH BRAKE PRESSURE BUT TRIPS IT UP A SECOND LATER AND YOU HAVE TO ALMOST TRICK THE BRAKE AND STEERING TO GET CONTROL AND STOP IN TIME.     THERE HAS BEEN TOO MUCH OF A PROCESS IN AN EFFORT TO CORRECT IT, OTHER ISSUES FOUND, AND MULTIPLE ACCIDENT CAUSED FROM IT ONE OF WHICH CAUSE A HOSPITAL VISIT AND AN INJURY LEAVING ME WILL A HEMATOMA AND CROOKED SMILE STILL. I NEED HELP AND MORE SPACE TO EXPLAIN. PLEASE EMAIL ME FOR DETAILS.  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HYUNDAI ELANTRA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE FLAT TIRE REPAIR KIT THAT CONSISTED OF FIX-A-FLAT AND AN AIR COMPRESSOR FAILED TO REMEDY A FLAT TIRE. THE CONTACT BELIEVED THE FLAT TIER REPAIR KIT WAS A HAZARD SINCE THE VEHICLE DID NOT COME EQUIPPED WITH A SPARE TIRE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT TAKEN TO THE DEALER. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE WHO DID NOT OFFER ANY ASSISTANCE. THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED. THE FAILURE AND CURRENT MILEAGE WAS 18,000.
CAR DEALERS ARE ALLOWED TO SELL NEW CARS WITH NO SPARE TIRE OR JACK. I ASSUME THIS IS TO INCREASE  THE POTENTIAL GAS MILEAGE FOR ADVERTISING. THEIR POLICY IS TO ONLY INCLUDE A CAN OF AIR WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT WORK WHEN NEEDED. THEY ARE ALSO NOT KEEPING REPLACEMENT TIRES IN STOCK.  THIS CAN OF AIR IS A HAZARD TO KEEP IN A CAR IN ARIZONA WHEN THE TEMPERATURES  IN THE SUMMER REACH 115 DEGREES. AND WITH  THE DEALERSHIP NOT STOCKING THE TIRES, MY CAR WAS NOT DRIVABLE AND STRANDS THE MOTORIST.  *TR
I was driving my 2012 Hyundai Elantra and it suddenly stopped. I took it to be checked out and it has an excessive oil consumption issue which can cause engine failure or a fire. Hyundai refuses to acknowledge the issue or fix it. After doing some research I see that this is a common problem with this car. I have to check my oil every 1000 miles and many times less than that and refill it. They should be held responsible and fix the issue. There should also have been a recall considering not only how dangerous this is, but also how many people are experiencing this.
The contact’s friend owned a 2012 Hyundai Elantra. The contact’s friend received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 23V651000 (Service Brakes, Hydraulic) however, the part to do the recall repair was not yet available. The contact stated that while the friend was leaving the store and driving out of a parking space, the friend heard a noise coming from the engine and observed black smoke coming from the front of the vehicle. The contact's friend attempted to put the vehicle in park but was unsuccessful.  While driving at 5 MPH, the front of the vehicle struck the curb and stopped. No warning light was illuminated. There were no injuries. The Fire Department and Police Department arrived on the scene. The Fire Department extinguished the fire. The contact stated the Fire Department and Police Department filed incident reports. The vehicle was destroyed. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 120,000.
Recall has been in effect since Sept 22, and still no remedy is available. Their only recommendation is to park away from buildings. Sometimes it is not possible to park away from buildings, and even when it is possible, it's increasingly inconvenient to park outside of my garage due to weather. I feel the risk of fire is low, but if there were one, any damage to my home would likely not be covered under insurance due to the recall notice. The delay in addressing the recall is unacceptably long, and I am filing a complaint in accordance with NHTSA recommendation.
I complied with Hyundai's voluntary recall of my 2012 Elantra, supposedly designed to deter theft with some sort of software update.  Four weeks after this, four teenager rolled up to my house in a stolen Hyundai Sonata. One of them jumped out of the car, smashed my car's back window, and stole my car. This whole process took place in broad daylight, in front of multiple witnesses, over approximately 30 seconds.  I contend that Hyundai's "voluntary recall" was 1) fraudulent, in that it does not do anything to fix the actual problem; 2) dangerous, in that it led owners to believe their car was safe when it fact it was not; and 3) a waste of taxpayers' time, as it caused me to take several hours off of work.  Hyundai should be compelled to 1) ACTUALLY fix these vehicles; 2) compensation any Hyundai owners whose vehicles were stolen. While I have insurance protection on this vehicle, I will almost certainly need to pay more money than that to replace this car with one of comparable utility to me.
My 2012 Hyundai Elantra has been subject to various recalls – such as number 20V393000, "12V outlet may overheat" – but that seems trivial compared to a safety issue I've been experiencing.  There are buttons on the Elantra steering wheel that control radio settings, cruise control, etc.  For the past several years, these buttons have been malfunctioning (having effects as if you had pressed a button other than the one you actually pressed).  This is a safety hazard if  1)  a driver needs to cancel cruise control, and presses the appropriate button, but some other effect happens and cruise control is not cancelled. 2)  a driver does not intend to engage cruise control, and presses a button that normally would not cause that to happen, but due to this malfunction, cruise control is engaged.  ?? know that tapping the brake is an alternative way to cancel cruise control – but in an emergency driving situation, some drivers will not think of that quickly enough, and rely solely on the steering wheel buttons which are subject to frequent malfunctions.  I am requesting a recall to fix this issue.
My motor has a knocking noise, it has not been inspected by anyone, oil has been changed, engine light is on, also my tail lights an brake lights go out an I have changed them 3 different time in the last 2 months, it could cause a accident, I have  called dealership an I have no recalls. But when I look it up I see other people who own same car has the same issues.
My car need fixed
BATTERY DRAINING OVERNIGHT. BRAKE LIGHTS AND INTERIOR LIGHTS GOING OFF AND ON OVERNIGHT. ALL OF THIS GOES OFF WHILE STATIONARY.O
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 HYUNDAI ELANTRA. THE CONTACT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 20V393000 (EQUIPMENT) HOWEVER, THE PART TO DO THE RECALL REPAIR WAS UNAVAILABLE. THE CONTACT CALLED MCDONALD HYUNDAI (6500 S. BROADWAY, LITTLETON, CO 80121; (720) 513-6046) WHERE IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT PARTS WERE NOT YET AVAILABLE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE MANUFACTURER EXCEEDED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THE RECALL REPAIR. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE ISSUE. THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE. PARTS DISTRIBUTION DISCONNECT.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 HYUNDAI ELANTRA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE BRAKE LIGHTS REMAINED ILLUMINATED WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION, WITHOUT THE BRAKE PEDAL BEING DEPRESSED. THE FAILURE PERSISTED FOR APPROXIMATELY TEN DAYS. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT TAKEN TO THE DEALER FOR A DIAGNOSTIC. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 106,000.
AIRBAG LIGHT CAME ON FOR NO REASON AND WON'T SHUT OFF. HAVE NOT BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT, NOT HAVE I HIT ANY POT HOLES. NO EXPLAINATION
WHILE SITTING AT LIGHT THE CAR BEGINS TO JERK LIKE IT WANTS TO CUT OFF.YES THIS HAPPENS AT STOP SIGNS IN THE COUNTRY AND CITY STREETS IN TOWN.
THE DRIVER WINDOW DROPPED TO THE DOOR WHILE I WAS DRIVING.  I WENT TO THE HYUNDAI DEALER WHO CHARGED ME OVER &400 AND STATED THAT THIS ISSUE IS VERY COMMON FOR ELANTRA.  I HAVE ELANTRA TOURING AND MY CAR IS NO QUALIFIED FOR RECALL.
I PURCHASED THE CAR USED, WHEN IT HAD 35,000 MILES ON IT.  AROUND 38,000 MILES, I STARTED TO EXPERIENCE AN ENGINE TICKING NOISE AND VIBRATION BEFORE COMING TO A STOP OR WHEN STARTING UP AFTER A STOP.  IT FEELS LIKE THE CAR WILL STALL, BUT IT NEVER ACTUALLY STALLS.  I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO SEVERAL MECHANICS AND THE HEAD MECHANIC AT A HYUNDAI DEALER.    THE HYUNDAI MECHANIC SAID THE ISSUE IS "COMMON" WITH HYUNDAI ELANTRAS.  HE LISTED OFF VARIOUS FIXES HE HAS TRIED, BUT SAID HE CAN'T FIGURE OUT A COMMON CAUSE.  WHEN I RESEARCHED THE ISSUE ONLINE, IT APPEARS THAT MANY OTHER HYUNDAI ELANTRA OWNERS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM (E.G. CARCOMPLAINTS.COM).  IT SEEMS THAT THERE ARE MANY HYUNDAI ELANTRA OWNERS WAITING ON ENGINE REPLACEMENTS, WITH HYUNDAI OFTEN NOT WANTING TO PAY FOR THE ENGINE.  I WONDER IF A RECALL IS NEEDED.
AIRBAG LIGHT IS ON CONTINUOUSLY BUT IS NOT DUE TO CLOCK SPRING ISSUES AS COVERED UNDER AN EXTENDED WARRANTY. DEALER DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A FAULTY AIRBAG CONTROL MODULE THAT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. THIS VEHICLE HAS NEVER BEEN IN ANY SORT OF ACCIDENT AND AN AIRBAG SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT WORK IS NOT A PART OF NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE THAT IS EXPLICITLY HYUNDAI'S RESPONSIBILITY.
AFTER PULLING INTO MY PARKING SPACE, I WENT TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND IT LUNGED FORWARD SEVERAL FEET ONTO THE PAVEMENT AND UP 2 STEPS IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE...THE VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY, AT THE CURB
MY STEERING IS LOOSE AND THE WHEEL CLUNKS AND RATTLES. SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE THE STEERING WHEEL WILL COME RIGHT OFF.  I CAN HIT THE SLIGHTEST BUMP AND IT WILL RATTLE AND SHAKE LIKE I RAN OVER A HUGE POT HOLE.  ALSO, WHEN I'M DRIVING THE CAR WILL SUDDENLY SLOW DOWN AND WHINE LIKE I HIT THE BRAKES EVEN WHEN I DIDN'T.  I WAS ALMOST REAR-ENDED WHEN I HIT THE GAS BUT THE CAR DECIDED IT WANTED TO SUDDENLY SLOW DOWN A FEW SECONDS LATER.  THERE IS SOMETHING TERRIBLY WRONG HERE.  THE ENGINE IS ALSO MAKING A TICKING/KNOCKING NOISE WHEN WARMING UP.  THIS HAPPENS DAILY.
"TAKATA RECALL" POOR ENGINE PERFORMANCE. ROUGH IDLE AT COLD START. SMELL GAS AS WELL. RANDOMLY BLOWS HUGE AMOUNTS OF SMOKE OUT THE TAIL PIPE WHILE ACCELERATING. "EXAMPLE" MERGING ON INTERSTATE. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE THE VEHICLE REACHED 50,000 MILES. ALL MAINTENANCE WORK HAS BEEN DONE. NOW AT 77,986 RUNS LIKE A GRASS CUTTER. JUST RUNS ROUGH.
THERE IS A LOT OF GIVE AND PLAY IN THE STEERING WHEEL WHEN YOU TURN IT THAT IT DOES NOT ACTUALLY TURN YOUR WHEELS.
2012 HYUNDAI ELANTRA LIMITED. THE AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT APPEARED RANDOMLY AT FIRST THEN REMAINED ON CONSTANTLY. OVER TIME, FUNCTIONALITY OF ALL STEERING WHEEL MOUNTED CONTROLS FOR CRUISE CONTROL, TRIP COMPUTER, BLUETOOTH, AUDIO SYSTEM, AND HORN WERE LOST. I DISASSEMBLED THE STEERING COLUMN TO ACCESS AND REMOVE THE AIR BAG CLOCKSPRING. I TESTED THE CONNECTIONS FOR CONTINUITY WITH A HANDHELD METER AND FOUND NONE ON ANY TERMINAL. THE CLOCK SPRING FAILED.
AIR BAG LIGHT COMING ON IN 2012 HYUNDAI ELANTRA, TOOK TO THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE A DIAGNOSTIC DONE WAS TOLD IT WAS THE CLOCK SPRING (IN THE STEERING COLUMN) WAS NO LONGER FUNCTIONING. WAS TOLD IF INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT THE AIR BAGS WILL NOT DEPLOY. THIS WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY PERIOD.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 HYUNDAI ELANTRA. WHILE DRIVING AT VARIOUS SPEEDS, THE ENGINE LIGHT REMAINED ILLUMINATED. IN ADDITION, WHILE DRIVING 65 MPH, THE VEHICLE SHOOK VIOLENTLY AND MADE A LOUD NOISE EACH TIME IT DROVE OVER A BUMP OR POTHOLE. THE FAILURE RECURRED NUMEROUS TIMES. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO A DEALER AND WAS REPAIRED FROM A PREVIOUS RECALL; HOWEVER, THE FAILURE RECURRED. THE CONTACT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 15V871000 (ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL). THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 61,828.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 HYUNDAI ELANTRA. WHILE DRIVING 50 MPH, THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO DECELERATE AND THE ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL LIGHT ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER WHERE THE FAILURE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 54,500.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 HYUNDAI ELANTRA. WHILE DRIVING OVER A BUMP, TAR, OR ROUGH PAVEMENT, THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE WOULD BECOME UNSTABLE AND SWAY VIOLENTLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER WHERE AN ALIGNMENT WAS PERFORMED, BUT THE FAILURE CONTINUED. DUE TO THE FAULTY SUSPENSION SYSTEM, THE TIRES WOULD BECOME WORN AT AN ACCELERATED RATE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURES. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 750.
WINDSHIELD WASHER STOPPED WORKING. REPORTED TO DEALERSHIP, THEY SAID THEY DON'T HAVE TIME TO FIX IT.
LEFT TAIL/BRAKE LIGHT IS MALFUNCTIONING.  WHEN THE HEADLIGHTS ARE ON, THE TAIL LIGHT IS ON; HOWEVER, THAT SAME LIGHT IS ALSO THE BRAKE LIGHT, AND WHEN THE BRAKE IS APPLIED, THE LIGHT WILL NOT ILLUMINATE.
WE WERE ON VACATION IN THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS. WE HIKED FOR A COUPLE HOURS AND RETURNED TO THE CAR. I TURNED THE IGNITION KEY, NOTHING. TRIED SEVERAL TIMES, NOTHING. LIGHTS CAME ON BRIGHT, POWER WINDOWS WORKED, DASHBOARD LIGHTS BRIGHT. I TRIED TAKING IT IN AND OUT OF PARK, TRIED TURNING THE KEY DIFFERENT SPEEDS, NOTHING. THE ENGINE DID NOT TRY TO TURN OVER, NO CLICKING, JUST SILENCE. WE TRIED TO GET HELP, NO ONE STOPPED. AFTER AN HOUR OR SO, TRIED IT AGAIN, STARTED RIGHT UP. WE DROVE BACK TO OUR CABIN. IT STARTED FINE THE REST OF THE TIME WE WERE THERE. WHEN WE GOT BACK HOME, TOOK IT TO THE HYUNDAI DEALER. EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM. HE SAID IF IT WAS WORKING FINE NOW, NOT MUCH THEY COULD DO. HE ALSO ADVISED ME THAT IF THEY DIAGNOSED IT FOR DAYS, FOUND THE PROBLEM, BUT IT WAS A LOOSE CONNECTION OR SOMETHING THAT DID NOT REQUIRE REPLACING A PART, THE ENTIRE LABOR COST WAS MINE TO PAY. THAT'S WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT THE HYUNDAI 5 YEAR, 60K WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER LABOR AFTER 36K. OUCH! A BUYER BEWARE/READ THE FINE PRINT MOMENT. SO, I LEFT SINCE IT HADN'T HAPPENED IN A COUPLE WEEKS. THIS FIRST INCIDENT WAS IN MID-OCTOBER. THREE WEEKS AGO, AFTER 2 MONTHS, AROUND DEC 20TH, 2014, IT HAPPENED AGAIN. SAME THING. JUST DEAD. BATTERY FINE. EVERYTHING WORKING BUT THE CAR. TRIED A HALF DOZEN TIMES, MOVING THE TRANNY SHIFTER, ETC. WENT IN THE HOUSE, CAME BACK OUT, STARTED LIKE NOTHING WAS WRONG. A WEEK AGO, SAME. THIS MORNING, JAN 8, 2015, AGAIN, SAME THING. I CHECKED THE BATTERY AND CONNECTIONS, BOTH FINE. AFTER 20 MINUTES OR SO, TRIED AGAIN, STARTED. IT IS HAPPENING MORE NOW. I RESEARCHED ON THE INTERNET AND HUNDREDS OF FOLKS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THIS MAKE, MODEL, AND YEAR. THERE ALSO ARE YOU TUBE VIDEOS OF IT. SO, THIS MAKES ME WONDER WHY THERE HASN'T BEEN A RECALL. MY ELANTRA HAS ALMOST 59K ON IT, SO I WILL BE AT THE 60K LIMIT IN A MONTH OR SO. WHAT CAN I DO?

MY 2012 HYUNDAI ELANTRA WILL NOT START.  I TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO GET IT TO START AND IT FINALLY STARTED. ALL INDICATOR LIGHTS WILL TURN ON BUT WHEN I TURNED THE IGNITION ALL THE WAY NOTHING HAPPENS. THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME MULTIPLE TIMES A YEAR. I HAD IT TOWED BEFORE TO THE DEALERSHIP SINCE IT'S STILL UNDER WARRANTY BUT THE DEALER COULDN'T FIND NOTHING WRONG SINCE IT STARTED UP FOR THEM. THE ISSUE HAS ONLY EVER OCCURRED WHEN MY CAR IS PARKED.   *TR
I ATTEMPTED TO START MY CAR LAST NIGHT AND IT DIDN'T START, LIGHTS WERE ON FULL POWER AND EVERYTHING BUT NOT A SOUND FROM THE ENGINE... TRIED MANY MANY TIMES DIDN'T START. THEN RANDOMLY IT STARTED. DROVE HOME PARKED WENT OUT THIS MORNING AND TRIED AGAIN DID NOT START. I HAVE TRIED MANY TIMES THIS MORNING BUT AGAIN IT HAS NOT STARTED.  *TR
VEHICLE WILL NOT START ONCE STOPPED.  AFTER AN HOUR OR SO IT WILL RESTART.  THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR ABOUT A YEAR.  IT HAPPENED AGAIN THIS MORNING (OCT. 16).      THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN CHECKED BY HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP WHERE PURCHASED IN BAYTOWN TEXAS.  ALSO AT NTB STORE IN ATASCOCITA, TX.  AFTER THOROUGHLY CHECKING ALL POSSIBLE CAUSES FOR THIS TYPE PROBLEM, THROUGH VEHICLE DIAGNOSTICS  THEN REPLACING THE BATTERY, NEITHER SERVICE CENTER HAS DETECTED A PROBLEM.  THEY HAVE GIVEN A RESOLUTION OF NO PROBLEM FOUND.    THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR A YEAR NOW.  THE PROBLEM STARTED ABOUT SIX MONTHS AFTER PURCHASING THIS VEHICLE.  *TR
I AM THE OWNER OF A 2012 HYUNDAI ELANTRA.  I BELIEVE THIS CAR HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING SYSTEM!    I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO THE SELLING DEALER AND WAS TOLD IT NEEDED AN ALIGNMENT AT A COST OF $90.00 (NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY).  I HAD THE ALIGNMENT DONE AND IT DID NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM!    I CONTACTED HYUNDAI CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE AND WAS TOLD TO TAKE THE CAR TO ANOTHER DEALER FOR EVALUATION. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSON TOLD ME TO EXPECT TO BE CHARGED FOR REPAIRS NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY!  THE SECOND DEALER ALSO SAID THE CAR NEEDED ALIGNMENT AT A COST OF $100.00!  I DECLINED THIS REPAIR; IT HAD NOT CORRECTED THE PROBLEM THE FIRST TIME!    I CONTACTED HYUNDAI CUSTOMER SERVICE AGAIN AND WAS TOLD THIS IS BEING MOVED UP REGIONAL!  I HAVE NOT HAD ANY CONTACT FROM HYUNDAI REGIONAL AS OF THIS DATE!    I BELIEVE HYUNDAI IS AWARE THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING SYSTEMS ON 2011, 2012 AND 2013 HYUNDAI ELANTRA AND HAS NO PLAN TO ISSUE A RECALL UNTIL SOMEONE DIES!  I BELIEVE HYUNDAI'S PUBLIC POSITION ON THIS MATTER IT TO TELL CUSTOMERS THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THEIR CARS; THEY JUST NEED ALIGNMENT, AT THE CUSTOMERS EXPENSE!  I BELIEVE HYUNDAI HAS ADOPTED THE POSITION THAT IF A CUSTOMER IS CHARGED OFTEN ENOUGH, THEY WILL STOP COMPLAINING, DRIVE THE CAR OR TRADE IT FOR ANOTHER BRAND!    EITHER WAY, HYUNDAI IS OFF THE HOOK!    I DO NOT PLAN TO BE HYUNDAI'S TEST SUBJECT!!!  I WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM UP TO ASKING HYUNDAI TO BUY THE CAR BACK FROM ME!  *TR

My 2013 Hyundai Elantra with the 1.8L Nu engine suffered catastrophic engine failure. A mechanic found metal shavings in the oil and diagnosed a failed connecting rod bearing. The Hyundai dealership quoted $10,000 for a new engine and refused warranty coverage because I am over 120,000 miles, even though this is a well-documented defect.  Hyundai issued TSB 22-EM-007H covering rod bearing wear in this engine, and there have been class actions and warranty extensions for similar failures. This failure creates a safety hazard, as the engine can seize or stall suddenly while driving, increasing risk of an accident.  I request NHTSA investigate this known defect in the 1.8L Nu engine, as it poses a safety risk to myself and others.
The contact owns a  2013 Hyundai Elantra. The contact stated while driving at an undisclosed speed, the vehicle stalled and lost motive power. The contact stated that the vehicle was restarted. The vehicle was driven to an independent mechanic where it was diagnosed with piston failure. The contact was informed that the engine needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was unknown.
There is a on going issue with clock spring failing on 2011-2014 Hyundai models. My model is not covered under their extended warranty cause I have a hatchback version of the Elantra, which uses the same parts. I have already replaced my clock spring at 2019 and again the issue has come in 2024. My air bag light is on, my car horn doesn't work and buttons on the steering wheel. Feel like this is a huge safety issue as I cannot communicate with other drives with my horn and I do not have a safety net of air bags deploying when a accident happens.
Engine has "piston" slap or knocking, a precursor to catastrophic engine seizure, diagnosed at Joe Machen's Hyundai at 132k miles on [XXX]. Engine could seize causing rapid deceleration at any moment, while pulling out into traffic or travelling at high speeds on the highway.  First noticed a clicking or ticking noise the engine made when it was cold around 130k mi, which goes away as engine warms up.  Sound has gotten louder and more persistent and has turned into a knocking.  Dealer told me that the entire engine needs replaced, which is prohibitively expensive.  So I'm driving it now until I can get a new car or engine replacement.  I've submitted a claim to the dealer and Hyundai corporate, but was denied.  I don't believe that Hyundai is taking responsibility for the safe operation and reliability of their cars. I have also not found the dealer to be a support and advocate.  There was a limited class action lawsuit where Hyundai settled for some faulty engines where there were metal burrs leftover in the oil passageways during manufacturing that causes engines to fail even when oil changes were done regularly  [XXX] ).  However, I don't think anything close to the number of engines with actual problems have been addressed.  Mine wasn't in the recall but has the piston slap.  I got regular oil changes with average 4,405 mi interval through today, while 7,500 mi interval is recommended in manual.  I have another friend with a 2017 Elantra that failed at 95k miles, and another with a Kia that failed.  Since Hyundai/Kia are very common cars, and owners often don't have the ability to replace the entire engine, and sometimes get no warning, the engine manufacturing defect needs to be looked into further by the NHTSA and Hyundai/Kia as a grave safety concern. Hyundai/Kia need to act promptly to prevent death and injury to their customers due to catastrophic engine failure.  We don't feel safe.

I heard a noise and felt a pull when turning the steering wheel while the car was stationary or at low speeds.  AAA said there was a recall and Hyundai would repair at no cost.  The dealer stated I had a defective steering flexible coupler.  If I did not replace, it could disintegrate in the steering column.  I was told Hyundai extended the warrantee to 10 years or 100,000 miles.  My 2013 car is 11 years old with 63,000 miles.  The cost of the repair was $657.68.  This is a safety issue with lots of complaints.  This should be a recall.  I want to be reimbursed for this manufacturing defect.
There is a known safety recall regarding brake fluid being leaked internally that has been acknowledged by Hyundai since September 2023. This can cause fires even when the vehicle is parked. NO SOLUTION has been provided except for "park your vehicle outside". This has been a known safety issue for 8 months and NO SOLUTION has been provided to us owners.  Even parking outside is an issue as I live in Memphis, TN the #1 city for auto theft. Auto theft has been rampant also due to Hyundai's unwillingness to install an ignition kill switch at production. Hyundai has been grossly negligent in the production of their vehicles and cutting corners at the consumer's safety expense.  Not having a soltuin

I got a recall letter in the mail and Burns Hyundai does not want to give me a service or loaner vehicle.
The engine shut down while driving, it turns on again if I go neutral and turn it on but very dangerous since it already happens me on the freeway also when you’re on a stop or light with the brakes on the car start to try to move even whit the brakes all the way down, engine make some noise when you start it when is cold.  car has been well maintained
Since I purchased this vehicle in 10-2012 I have had major suspension tracking issues. When driving at normal highway speeds (50-70MPH), the slightest bump in the road makes the rear of the vehicle sway and "dog walk" . This has been an issue within the first few months of ownership, but the dealership found no issues. The situation started shortly after purchase and continues the same as of today (5-5-2023). I have replaced the rear shocks with better than OEM shocks  and continue to have the same situation. If the bump in the road happens to be in a slight curve (such as an expansion joint in bridge) on the Interstate, the vehicle nearly looses complete traction. This happens with new tires and on dry, warm concrete. I have spoken with other owners of similar make and year and all have said they had the same issue, even right after purchase. No warning lights, traction control lights or messages appear on display.. I have had multiple inspection stations and garages check out the suspension and wheel units, but no malfunctions or defects found.
Engine failure diagnosed on 2013 Elantra GT at 47,000 miles. No warning light only a ticking sound and in the original lawsuit however my state does not qualify in Nevada for a replacement.  Thousands have failed per the lawsuit yet Hyundai appears to be denying claims left and right and many other types, years and models were excluded based on where you live.  The lawsuit was a mere band aid with many loopholes that all Hyundai to deny claims and have customers driving in a vehicle that can stall any minute and cause bodily harm or death.  Hyundai is keenly aware and I was told by dealership to have my towed in, but no way they will approve it.  I am out of pocket $10,000 cash for a car that likely ends up being sold for scrap.  Why on earth is your agency allowing this madness to continue?  Every single Hyundai that an engine fails in involved in this lawsuit should be replaced or eligible for a buy back but that is not what is happening.
The brake light switch had to be replaced again. The brakes light was staying on while driving  and barked. The same item was on a recall about 4 to 5 years ago. The part is still failing.
In July 2015 with 25k miles, the interior of the vehicle was leaking water from the sun visor as well as under the glove box. When I made a left turn I could hear water swishing from one side to the other, then saw water coming out from under the glove box area. Water also dripped from the drivers sun visor. I took it to the dealer in Troy MI and they blamed me for having dirty drain holes in the sun roof as well as having a wind deflector on the sun roof which caused dirt to build up and clog the drain holes. The sun roof and wind deflector were factory installed as I bought the vehicle brand new in 2013.  The dealer did not remove the headliner to see if any mold was visible. They used an air compressor to clean out the clogged drain holes and charged me for the service even though the vehicle was still under warranty (dealer said it was not covered under warranty). I am not aware of the issue happening again, or if it did happen it wasn't enough water for me to notice. I however have and do smell mold in my vehicle daily. Today, June 7, 2022, with 116k miles, after leaving my car parked outside overnight with heavy rain I again experienced water build up inside the car. I saw water coming out from under the glove box and heard it swishing around. I called the dealer in Troy MI and was told they cannot service my vehicle, it is a 4 month wait for diagnosis. I called a second dealer in Macomb MI and was told the vehicle could not be looked at until August and all expenses would be my responsibility. The service tech stated the car would need to be torn apart (dash, door, headliner, etc) to find where the water was coming from.  A dealer in Southfield MI would be able to service the vehicle two days from now, I'm suppose to drive two days with water swishing around? What electrical safety issues are at hand here? It seems as though HYUNDAI has a defect in the design or part(s) which is causing this issue. I am also concerned with mold growth from back in 2015.
The airbag light turned on about a month ago, and it stays on for a while then goes off then goes back on and so on. It is very disturbing that this could be a life threatening issue.   My tire pressure sensor light is always on. I check the pressure at least once a week to make sure it’s okay, but the light is always on.
There was a recall on previous Hyundai models for this same issue. The HYUNDAI Genuine OEM Flexible Steering Couple 56315-2K000FFF.  I began to notice a slight sound a year ago, & it got worse. This is a KNOWN issue, yet Hyundai is saying its not a recall. This is an $8.00 part but in a spot that will cost $300+ in labor.  This is a manufacture design flaw that should have never happened. Driving down the road the wheel is not stable.
The contact owns a 2013 Hyundai Elantra. The contact stated while driving 55 mph, the traction control warning light illuminated and the vehicle decelerated. The vehicle was making an abnormal sound. The contact switched to ECON mode and the vehicle operated as designed. The vehicle was not taken to a dealer nor an independent mechanic to be diagnosed or repaired. The local dealer was made aware of the failure and the contact was awaiting a callback from the dealer. The contact researched the failure online and related the failure to NHTSA Campaign Number: 20V061000 (Service Brakes, Hydraulic) however, the Vin was not included in the recall. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 44,000.
WHEN BRAKING THE BRAKE PEDAL  SEEMED "SOFT" AND AFTER ABOUT 40 MILES OF DRIVING IT WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR. I HAD REACHED HOME BY THEN. THERE WERE DROPS OF FLUID ON THE PAVEMENT AFTER I BACKED IN AND PARKED.I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE HYUNDAI DEALER AND INSPECTION REVEALED THAT NOT ONLY BOTH BRAKE LINES HAD RUSTED THROUGH, BUT, THE FUEL LINES HAD ALSO RUSTED THROUGH AND WERE LEAKING.
EVERY TIME  I TURN THE VEHICLE ON MY AIR BAG LIGHT COMES ON.  SOME TIMES STAY ON ALL THE TIME AND SOME TIMES IT GOES OFF AND ON WHILE I'M DRIVING.
AFTER GETTING THE RECALL FOR BRAKES DONE , TWO MONTHS LATER MY STEERING WHEEL STARTED DOING A CLUCK SOUND WHENEVER I TURN MY STEERING WHEEL. IT DOES IT WHEN DRIVING, PARKED , ON THE HIGHWAY, AND THE CITY STREET.
SINCE I OWNING THIS CAR I HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH ALL LIGHTS. BOTH HEADLIGHT LAMPS HAD TO BE REPLACED DUE TO A DEFECT. ALSO I HAD BEEN REPLACING TAIL, BRAKE, AND TURNING SIGNAL LIGHTS AT EVERY OIL CHANGE BECAUSE ONE OR THE OTHER WILL BE OUT. I HAVE NEVER HAD TO REPLACE THIS MANY BULBS ON ANY OTHER CAR I HAVE OWNED.  THIS OIL CHANGE JUNE 27, 2020 I HAD 3 BULBS OUT BREAK, TAIL LIGHT AND PARKING LIGHT ALL OUT AT THE SAME TIME. THIS HAS BEEN AND FEELS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE AN ON GOING PROBLEM NOT TO MENTION THE COST EVERYTIME THEY NEED TO BE REPLACED.  THEM LIGHT ARE NOT CHEAP.  *TR
WHEN TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL EITHER PARKED OR DRIVING IT MAKES A CLICK/THUD SOUND UPON THE STEERING WHEEL GOING BACK TO THE CENTER.
WE WERE DRIVING TO TAKE ONE OF MY KIDS DR APPOINTMENT.  WE STOPPED TO GET DRINKS FOR THE ROAD.  WE TURNED THE CAR OFF CAME BACK TO LEAVE AND IT WOULD NOT START FIX THE PROBLEM THAT IT SAID AND THAT DIDNT FIX IT.  WHEN YOU GO TO START IT IT WANTS TO TURN OVER BUT CANT CATCH EVERYTHING STILL WORKS THE WAY IT SHOULD PISTONS MOVE HAVE POWER TO EVERYTHING,TIMING CHAIN DIDNT JUMP THE SPARK PLUGS STILL ALL GET SPARK.
COUPLING IN THE STEERING WHEEL IS LOSE. SAME THING HAPPENED TO MY 2013 SONATA. DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THIS WAS A SAFETY ISSUE AND THEN CHARGED ME $424 TO REPAIR THE SONATA 2 YEARS AGO. WHEN I TAKE THE ELECTRA IN I'M SURE I WILL BE CHARGED SAME REPAIR COST.   THIS OCCURS WHEN TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL. CAN HEAR AND FEEL THE CLANG AS THE COUPLING RATTLES AROUND.   LOOKED FOR SAFETY RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE FOR 2013 HYUNDAI'S BUT DID NOT FIND ANY RECALLS. SHOULD BE A FREE FIX IF IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE

"TAKATA RECALL"MY STEERING WHEEL COLUMN RATTLES AND SHAKES WHEN I AM DRIVING. IT SOUNDS LIKE THE STEERING WHEEL IS GOING TO FALL OFF. THE STEERING WHEEL FEELS LOOSE. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON TWO YEARS AFTER IT WAS BOUGHT. THE FASTER YOU GO THE WORST IT GETS.  IT HAPPENS IN THE CITY AND HIGHWAY.
AS WITH MANY OTHERS, MY 2013 ELANTRA LIKES TO KICK THE BACK END OUT OVER BUMPS AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. I PASSED AN ACCIDENT LAST WEEKEND ON THE HIGHWAY WHERE A 2013 ELANTRA HAD CRASHED INTO THE CEMENT BARRIER JUST AFTER A BRIDGE ON WET ROADS. MY CAR JUMPED OVER THE SAME BUMP ALTHOUGH I WAS AT A LOWER SPEED BECAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT AND IT WASN'T AS SEVERE AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF I WAS GOING FASTER. IT IS MUCH WORSE AS THE CAR GETS OLDER. IT ALSO HAS OTHER ISSUES THAT OWNERS HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT SUCH AS NOT WANTING TO START (3 TIMES) AND WHITE SMOKE IF YOU ACCELERATE TOO QUICKLY. DEALER HAS BEEN NO HELP.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 HYUNDAI ELANTRA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE STABILITRAK AND TRACTION CONTROL WARNING INDICATORS FLASHED, THE STEERING WHEEL MADE AN ABNORMAL NOISE WHEN TURNED IN EITHER DIRECTION, AND THE VEHICLE ACCELERATED SLOWLY WHEN THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WAS DEPRESSED. RANCHO GRANDE MOTORS (1404 AUTO PARK WAY, SAN LUIS OBISPO, CA 93405, (805) 543-4745) WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURES. THE VEHICLE WAS CURRENTLY AT THE DEALER FOR DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURES. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 39,600.
STARTED HEARING A TICKING NOISE IN THE ENGINE ONCE IT TURNED COLD. WOULD HEAR THE NOISE WHEN I STARTED UP THE CAR FROM A STATIONARY POSITION AND NOISE WOULD ACCELERATE AS I PRESSED ON THE GAS AND DECREASE AS I SLOWED DOWN.  TOOK TO A HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WERE METAL SHAVINGS  PROBABLY FROM THE ROD BEARINGS IN THE ENGINE.  TOLD I WOULD NEED A NEW ENGINE AND PROVIDED A COST OF $8,000.
FREE PLAY IN STEERING WHEEL BETWEEN 11 AND 1. VERY DANGEROUS ON SKINNY FREEWAY LANES...VEHICLE ALMOST DRIFTED INTO BARRIER WALL ON GROOVED PAVEMENT IN CONSTRUCTION ZONE WITHOUT ABILITY TO SAFELY CORRECT AND MAINTAIN LANE. IN RESEARCHING, APPEARS AS RECALL ON OTHER MODELS, BUT NOT ON THIS MODEL. SCHEDULED FOR SERVICE ON 12/17/18 AT DEALERSHIP TO REPLACE THE $2.00 FAULTY PART. NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO THE LABOR BILL TO REPAIR VEHICLE TO SAFELY MANEUVER THE DAILY FREEWAY TRAVELING CONDITION. THIS IS CLEARLY A SAFETY ISSUE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY COST LIVES AND NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED WITH THE MANUFACTURER.
MY STEERING COUPLER HAS DETERIORATED TO THE POINT WHERE IT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE MY VEHICLE.  I HAVE SEEN MANY OTHER REPORTS OF THE SAME PROBLEM ONLINE
"TAKATA RECALL" 2013 ELANTRA WILL DISPERSE A HUGE CLOUD OF SMOKE WHEN ACCELERATING QUICKLY MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR DRIVERS BEHIND ME TO SEE. THIS HAPPENS INTERMITTENTLY BUT MOST OFTEN WHEN PULLING OUT ONTO A BUSY HIGHWAY MAKING IT INCREDIBLY UNSAFE FOR PEOPLE BEHIND ME. THERE IS SO MUCH SMOKE IT TAKES ABOUT 30 SECONDS TO A MINUTE TO FOR ME TO SEE THE CARS BEHIND ME.  THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ON LINE ABOUT THIS AND VIDEOS OF IT HAPPENING. DEALER TOLD ME IT WAS BECAUSE OF AN OVERFLOW OF OIL BECAUSE I WAS GETTING OIL CHANGES OUTSIDE THE DEALER. THE DEAL CHANGED MY OIL IT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN. DIFFERENT DEALERS HAVE DIFFERENT EXCUSES OF WHY THIS IS HAPPENING. IT'S VERY DANGEROUS FOR THE DRIVERS BEHIND THESE VEHICLES AND I AM SURE NOT GOOD FOR THE CAR.
WHILE DRIVING ON THE TURNPIKE AT 75 MPH MY CAR SHUT OFF COMPLETELY.  IT JERKED VIOLENTLY AND THEN POWERED BACK ON.  THIS HAPPENED IN THE DARK AND I DIDN'T HAVE ANY LIGHTS EITHER. THIS HAS HAPPENED A TOTAL OF 4 TIMES WHILE DRIVING AT SPEEDS OF 70 OR MORE. PRIOR TO THIS THE EPS LIGHT CAME ON I TOOK IT IN DEALER AND THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR. I HAVEN'T TAKEN IN TO THE DEALER AS IT WILL NEED TO BE TOWED.  IT IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE.
MY DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING HOME, CITY STREET, APPROXIMATELY 30 MILES PER HOUR, DRY WEATHER, 8 P.M., STILL DAYLIGHT BUT INDIRECT, APPROXIMATELY 70 DEGREES, HEARD A VERY LOUD EXPLOSION AND WAS IMMEDIATELY SHOWERED WITH VERY SHARP SHARDS OF GLASS.HER INFANT DAUGHTER IN THE REAR SEAT WAS NOT INJURED AS HER CAR SEAT COVER PROTECTED HER FROM THE FLYING GLASS.  MY DAUGHTER RECEIVED NUMEROUS SMALL CUTS FROM THE GLASS.  ORIGINAL OWNER OF THE CAR, ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT. SHE QUICKLY CLOSED THE INTERIOR SUNROOF COVER TO PREVENT THE REMAINDER OF THE GLASS FROM RAINING ONTO HERSELF AND THE BABY.  PICTURES WILL BE FORTHCOMING WHEN WE CAN SAFELY OPEN THE INTERIOR COVER- WE TRIED TO DO SO TO GET A PHOTO TO SUBMIT BUT MORE GLASS SHARDS CAME DOWN ON HER, CUTTING HER AGAIN

AIRBAG LIGHT CAME ON AFTER 100,000 MILES.  MY CAR IS OUT OF THE INITIAL WARRANTY.  DEALERSHIP WANTS TO RUN A DIAGNOSTIC FOR 115$, NOT INCLUDING PARTS OR LABOR FOR FINDINGS.  THE LIGHT CAME ON WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS RUNNING AND IN MOTION.  AT FIRST, IT CAME ON AND OF, THEN STAYED ON.
THE AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT CAME ON ON MY DASHBOARD A FEW DAYS AGO AND HAS BEEN ON EVER SINCE. I HAVE READ ON SEVERAL ONLINE FORUMS HOW SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HAVING THE SAME ISSUE AND HOW THIS MEANS THAT THE AIRBAG WILL NOT DEPLOY DURING A COLLISION. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND THE DEALERSHIPS SHOULD BE CHARGING OVER $250 TO CORRECT THIS DEFECT. I HAVE NOT YET BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT, BUT I DON'T WANT TO WAIT UNTIL THEN FOR SOMEONE TO TAKE ACTION. THANK YOU.
I BOUGHT A 2013 HYUNDAI ELANTRA LIMITED NEW. 3 YEARS LATER THE CAR STALLS OUT WHEN STOPPED AND IT DIFFICULT TO START.  HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP SO MANY TIMES (10) WITHIN A 2 MONTH PERIOD, I USE THE LOANER MORE THAN MY OWN CAR.  THE LAST TIME I PICKED IT UP THEY HAD CHANGED OUT THE TIMING COVER WITH OIL PUMP, CAM SHAFT AND TIMING CHAIN.  CALLED ME TO COME PICK MY VEHICLE UP AS IT WAS READY.  WHEN EXITING THE DEALERSHIP, I CAME TO THE STOP LIGHT AND THE CAR STALLED ONCE AGAIN WITH IT BEING DIFFICULT TO START. TURNED AROUND AND THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT DRIVE FASTER THAN 20 MPH. THE SERVICE MANAGER CAME OUT AND ASKED WHAT WAS WRONG.  I ASKED HIM TO GET IN THE VEHICLE THAT THEY HAD JUST FIXED.  HE DROVE IT AND THEY NOW HAVE MY CAR ONCE AGAIN AND I'M DRIVING THE LOANER.  THEY CAN'T SEEM TO FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND SAY THEY KEEP CALLING THE MANUFACTURER FOR INPUT.  APPARENTLY NO ONE KNOWS WHAT IS WRONG AND I WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER HYUNDAI AS IT SEEMS THEY CAN'T REPAIR THEIR VEHICLES WITH THESE SIMILAR PROBLEMS.
AFTER 50K MILES THE CAR STARTED TO IDLE ROUGH. CHANGED SPARK PLUGS, AIR FILTER, ETC. STILL RAN ROUGH. CAR NOW STALLS OUT WHEN STOPPED IN TRAFFIC, AND LATELY WILL NOT ACCELERATE UP TO SPEED FROM A STOPPED POSITION TOO WELL. STARTED TO HEAR A 'CLICKING' NOISE THAT IS SYNCED WHEN I PRESS THE GAS. THE VEHICLE IS NOW STALLING WHEN I PUT IT IN REVERSE AS WELL.
PUSH BUTTON START.  CAR WILL NOT START RIGHT AWAY AFTER DEPRESSING THE START BUTTON.  WHEN START BUTTON IS DEPRESSED, INDICATING LIGHTS ON THE DASH WILL ILLUMINATE, AND APPROXIMATELY 10 SECOND LATER, THE RADIO AND THE AIR CONDITIONING WILL KICK IN.  AT THIS POINT I HAVE APPROXIMATELY 10 SECONDS TO ATTEMPT TO START THE CAR AND 75% OF THE TIME THE CAR WILL START; OTHERWISE, I HAVE TO TURN THE CAR OFF AND ATTEMPT TO RESTART AGAIN.  THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR APPROXIMATELY TWO MONTHS NOW. TOOK IT INTO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY STATED THEY COULD NOT RECREATE THE PROBLEM AS THE CAR STARTED FOR THEM EVERY TIME APPARENTLY AND COULD NOT DO ANYTHING TO SOLVE MY ISSUE, EVEN THOUGH THEY ADMITTEDLY TIGHTENED UP TERMINALS FOR THE BATTERY. THE CAR SEEMED TO START EVERY SINGLE TIME FOR ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THE VISIT, AND NOW IT'S DOING IT AGAIN.  CALLED HYUNDAI AND THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT ISSUE.  I'VE RESORTED TO TAKING VIDEO TO HELP DESCRIBE THE ISSUE TO TECHNICIANS, AND THE LATEST DEALERSHIP BASICALLY TOLD ME THAT THEY STILL WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO USE MY VIDEO BUT WOULD HAVE TO RECREATE THE PROBLEM THEMSELVES.  THIS IS GOING TO BE REALLY BAD IF I'M STUCK IN SOMEWHERE BECAUSE MY CAR WON'T START AND HYUNDAI CLAIMING THEY CANT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
THE GEAR SHIFT IN MY AUTOMATIC DRIVE 2013 HYUNDAI ELANTRA WILL NOT SHIFT BACK INTO PARK OCCASSIONALY. WITH SOME TRYING IT HAS GONE BACK INTO PARK OR USING THE SHIFT LOCK. I ASSUME THAT THIS COULD CAUSE SOME POTENTIAL DANGER HAD I NOT BEEN ON A FLAT SERVICE OR IN AN AREA WHERE I COULD TRY TO GET IT TO GO BACK IN TO PARK.  LUCKILY I WAS STATIONARY ON A LEVEL LOT DURING THE 5 TIMES THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME. THIS HAS OCCURRED MULTIPLE TIMES AND MY CAR HAS APPROXIMATELY 55K MILES.
I HAVE 2013 HYUNDAI ELANTRA EQUIPPED WITH HANKOOK OPTIMO H426 TIRES, SIZE: P205/55R16. I DISCOVERED BUBBLES ON THE SIDEWALLS OF THE DRIVER SIDE TIRE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO A DEALER, BUT WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE.  THE TIRE WAS THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE OF THE VEHICLE AND TIRE WAS 20,000.
TIRES ARE DAMAGE AND MANUFACTURER NOR HYUNDAI WANTS TO REPLACE THEM EVEN THOUGH IS A SAFETY ISSUE
THE DEALERSHIP HAS CONSISTENTLY OVER-TORQUED THE WHEEL LUG NUT/BOLTS AND IT SEEMS THAT THE SITUATION IS GETTING WORSE. THE SPECIFICATION FOR THE LUG NUTS IS UP TP 79 FT-LBS.. THE LAST SERVICE BY THE DEALERSHIP TIGHTEN THEM TO 200-300 FT-LBS, OR MORE.  THE MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP DEFENDED THEIR WORK AND DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT A FT-LB  WAS, NOT ALONE THE ELASTIC LIMIT OF THE BOLTS, NUTS AND ALLOY WHEELS.  THEY SEEM TO THINK THAT THE CAR IS SAVE TO DRIVE, BUT CAN'T SAY WHY THEIR OVER-TORQUING MIGHT EVEN BE CONSIDERED A HAZARD .  I POSE THAT THERE IS AN SYSTEMIC OVER-RELIANCE ON "TORQUE STICKS" ON IMPACT WRENCHES FOR TIGHTENING BOLTS.  THEY DO NOT USE TORQUE WRENCHES. YOU SHOULD WATCH FOR LUG BOLT FAILURES BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SYSTEMATIC ISSUE.    REGARDS,  GEORGE BOSKOSH BSEE. MSMINE
I'M WRITING TO NOTIFY YOU OF MY REOCCURRING ISSUE ON MY 2013 HYUNDAI ELANTRA.  UPON PURCHASING MY VEHICLE ON OR ABOUT 5,000 MILES, MY CAR WOULD HAVE FALSE STARTS.  I BROUGHT THE ISSUE UP DURING ONE OF MY EARLY MAINTENANCE VISITS AT DANBURY HYUNDAI WHICH WAS ON DECEMBER 1, 2012, IN WHICH THEY STATED TO ME THAT THEY WERE MY HEADLIGHTS.   ANY INDIVIDUAL WITH COMMON SENSE KNOWS TRANSMISSION AND STARTER ISSUES HAVE NO CORRELATION TO HEADLIGHTS.  IN ANY EVENT, MY CAR BEGAN NOT IGNITING AT ALL ON OR ABOUT 56,000 MILES (VIDEO FOOTAGE OF THIS WILL BE PROVIDED IF NEEDED).   PRIOR TO THIS, IT WOULD HAVE FALSE STARTS OCCASIONALLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BUT NEVER ON A DAILY BASIS UNTIL RECENTLY.  I'VE HAD MY CAR TOWED TWICE IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST TO DANBURY HYUNDAI AND BOTH OCCASIONS THEY SAID THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO FOR ME.  AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, HAVING LEMON OF A CAR SINCE THE PURCHASE IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING AND I WARN EVERYONE AROUND ME TO NEVER PURCHASE A HYUNDAI UNLESS YOU WANT TO PUMP YOUR GAS AND WAIT AN HOUR FOR YOUR CAR TO START, IF THAT'S THE KIND OF RELIABILITY YOU WANT THEN GO FOR IT.     ON SEPTEMBER 9TH, 2015, MY CAR WAS RETURNED TO ME AND WAS WORKING PROPERLY UNTIL YESTERDAY SEPTEMBER 16TH.  PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT AT 4:08 P.M. LEAVING WORK MY CAR WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE THE GEARS AND WOULD NOT START AND AT 7:19P.M. THE SAME ISSUE OCCURRED.      GOOGLE SEARCH YIELDED OTHERS WITH MY CAR WHO HAVE THE SAME ISSUE! THESE ARE BRAND NEW CARS BEING ISSUED!!

SUN ROOF EXPLODED WHILE DRIVING.
SINCE I BROUGHT THE CAR BRAND NEW IN JUNE OF 2012 I HAVE BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE FRONT TIRE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. I HAVE BROUGHT NEW TIRES AND THE TIRE PRESSURE LIGHT COMES ON ALL THE TIME. POHANKA REPLACE THE VALVE STEM BACK IN AUGUST. NO THEY ARE TELLING ME I HAVE TO REPLACE THE SENSOR 3 AND REGISTER THE TMPS SENSORS FOR $220.00 AND I ALSO HAVE BEEN REPLACING THE HEADLIGHTS AND TAIL LIGHTS MORE THEN I LIKE TOO. VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER. I PREVIOUSLY OWNED AN 2002 HYUNDAI ELANTRA BROUGHT IT BRAND NEW I HAD IT FOR 10 YEARS AND DIDN'T THIS MUST PROBLEM AND HAD 262,000 MILES ON THAT CAR. I LOVE THE NEW MODEL BUT SHOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS MANY PROBLEMS.  *TR
I PURCHASED THIS CAR IN JULY 2014. A.  2013 HYUNDAI ELANTRA AND AFTER 3 WEEKS THE FRONT PASSENGER TIRE WENT OUT AFTER BARELY HITTING CURB AROUND BY SEPTEMBER 2014, THE DRIVERS TIRE WAS DEFLATING REPLACED. ON 2/10/2015 THE TIRE IN REAR WENT OUT WHILE DRIVING ON HIGHWAY, THE DEALERSHIP SAYS IT COULD BECAUSE A NAIL GOT INTO THE TIRE AND CAUSED THE PROBLEM.  IT JUST SEEMS A BIT UNUSUAL FOR 3 TIRES IN LESS THAN A YEAR OF OWNING THIS VEHICLE, WHICH WAS NEW PURCHASED JULY 2014.  2013 HYUNDAI ELANTRA.  *TR
MY HYUNDAI ELANTRA GT CAME WITH HANKOOK OPTIMO H426 215R45 17 TIRES. THESE ORIGINAL TIRES HAD LESS THAN 29,000 MILES ON THEM AT THE TIME THE DEFECT WAS NOTICED. THE FRONT DRIVER SIDE TIRE HAD DEVELOPED A SERIOUS DEFECT/BULGE IN THE SIDEWALL AND HAD TO BE REPLACED IMMEDIATELY AS THE TIRE COULD FAIL AND CAUSE VEHICLE LOSS OF CONTROL AND POTENTIALLY AN ACCIDENT THAT COULD CAUSE INJURY.  *TR
I BOUGHT MY 2013 HYUNDAI ELANTRA GT ON SEPTEMBER 12, 2014, IT HAD 41053 MILES ON IT. AS I LEFT THE DEALERSHIP IT WAS RAINING VERY HARD AND I NOTICED THAT IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP THE CAR IN MY LANE; MY CAR WAS PULLING TO THE RIGHT, NOT ONLY THAT, I HIT A BUMP OR MANHOLE AND THE BAD END OF THE CAR FISHTAILED SO BAD THAT I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO HIT THE CAR THAT WAS IN THE RIGHT LANE. I WAS DRIVING A FEW DAYS LATER, I HIT ANOTHER POTHOLE AND THE CAR DID THAT SAME THING BUT THIS TIME THE ROADS WERE DRY. AT THIS POINT, I REALIZE THAT THE FIRST INCIDENT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ROADS BEING WET, IT WAS THE SUSPENSION ON THE CAR THAT'S CAUSES THE CAR TO PULL TO ONE SIDE AND FOR IT TO FISHTAIL THE WAY IT DOES.  I DID SOME RESEARCH AND I REALIZED THAT HYUNDAI OWNERS HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FOR QUITE SOMETIME BUT THE HYUNDAI CORPORATION FAILS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS AS A PROBLEM; THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM. TO BE HONEST, I'M A LITTLE FRIGHTEN TO DRIVE MY CAR; HYUNDAI CORPORATION NEEDS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A SUSPENSION PROBLEM WITH THE MAKE AND MODEL AND  THEY NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM ASAP BEFORE SOMEONE LOSES THEIR LIFE.    *TR
UNABLE TO MOVE THE CAR OUT OF PARK.  THE ELECTRICAL WORKED (RADIO, WINDOWS).  I INSERT THE KEY AND TURN BUT THE CAR WONT TURN OVER (START).     I HAVE TO USE THE SHIFT LOCK RELEASE TO START THE CAR.  THE PROBLEM OCCURS INTERMITTENTLY AND THERE IS NO PATTERN.
ON MY WAY TO WORK I WAS EXITING THE HIGHWAY AND I HIT A BUMP. I WAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE AS WHAT FELT LIKE THE REAR OF THE CAR BOUNCED UP ABNORMALLY AND LURCH TOWARD THE GUARD RAIL. THE HANDLING ON ROUGH SURFACES IS AWFUL. THIS COULD LEAD TO AN ACCIDENT. I JUST BOUGHT THIS CAR USED AND THE ENGINE IS NOISY WHICH I AM TOLD THIS IS THE TIMING CHAIN. I NEVER HAD A CAR LIKE THIS IN MY LONG LIFE. THE HANDLING REALLY WORRIES ME. SUCKS!  *TR
I WAS DRIVING OUR BRAND NEW CAR AND MY 3 YEAR OLD OPENED THE BACK DOOR, IMAGINE MY SURPRISE AND SHOCK WHEN I GO TO LOCK THE CHILD LOCK AND THERE ISN'T ONE! I'M SO DISAPPOINTED AND UPSET.  *TR
THE CAR CAME WITH CONTINENTAL TIRES AND BOTH THE FRONT TIRES SIDEWALL HAVE BUBBLES.  SEEMS TO BE TIRE DEFECT.  HYUNDAI - BRAD BENSON HYUNDAI - NJ REFUSED TO COVER THE TIRES.  HUYNDAI REFUSED TO REPLACE THE TIRES.  CONTINENTAL TIRES PAID 50 % OF THE COST TO REPLACE BOTH THE FRONT TIRES.  I STILL PAID 160/- FOR 2 FRONT TIRES.    THERE SEEMS TO BE A DEFECT IN THE TIRES OR THE ELANTRA 2013 4 DR LTD DESIGN.    I WOULD LIKE TO BE COMPENSATED.  I AM SCARED TO DRIVE THE CAR NOW.  MAYBE ALL 4 TIRES NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.  *TR
WIPER FLUID PRESSURE AND DIRECTION IS NOT ADEQUATE TO CLEAR WINDSHIELD DURING WINTER DRIVING CONDITIONS.  THE MAJORITY OF THE FLUID NEVER CONTACTS THE WIPERS BEFORE RUNNING OFF TO THE SIDE.     INVER GROVE HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP LOOKED AT THIS PROBLEM ON TWO OCCASIONS.  ON THE FIRST VISIT, THE TECHNICIAN WHO DROVE THE CAR AGREED THERE WAS A PROBLEM.  THEY SHIMMIED THE NOZZLES AND TOLD ME TO BRING IT BACK IF NOT IMPROVED.  I BROUGHT IT BACK AGAIN BECAUSE I SAW NO IMPROVEMENT AND THE PROBLEM WAS GETTING WORSE WITH THE COLD WEATHER.  I TOLD THEM I FELT IT WAS A SAFETY CONCERN.  THE RESPONSE ON THE SECOND VISIT WAS, AFTER FLUSHING THE SYSTEM, THE WIPER FLUID WAS PERFORMING SIMILAR TO OTHER ELANTRAS AND, SINCE THERE ARE NO ADJUSTMENTS TO MAKE, THERE WAS NOTHING FURTHER THEY COULD DO.  THEY WOULD NOT SAY IF THEY AGREED THERE WAS A PROBLEM OR NOT.    THEY REFERRED ME TO CORPORATE HYUNDAI. THEIR REP LOOKED AT THE VIDEO REFERENCED BELOW AND GAVE ME THE SAME RESPONSE AS THE DEALERSHIP.  THE DISMISSED MY CONCERNS AND GAVE ME NO RECOURSE.    HERE IS THE LINK TO THE VIDEO THAT SHOWS THE WIPER FLUID UNDER-SHOOTING THE WIPER BLADES, TAKEN FEB 7 AFTER MY SECOND VISIT TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE DRIVER SIDE IS PARTICULARLY BAD ON THIS OCCASION BUT BOTH ARE EFFECTED AND PERFORMANCE SEEMS TO VARY DEPENDING ON AIR TEMPERATURE AND SPEED:  HTTP://YOUTU.BE/K4_XJ-VYLCC.  *TR
THE WINDSHIELD WASHER DOES NOT WORK IN BELOW 24 DEGREES. I HAVE HAD TO STOP WHILE DRIVING MANY TIMES TO CLEAN WINDSHIELD BY HAND ,PUTTING MY SELF AND OTHER DRIVERS IN GREAT DANGER.  I HAVE USED MULTIPLE BRANDS OFF WASHER FLUIDS INCLUDING DE-ICERS  WITH OUT SUCCESS. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR 40 YEARS AND HAVE HAD MANY VEHICLES AND NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM.            2013 ELANTRA GT (NOT ON DROP DOWN LIST)  *TR
I PURCHASED A NEW 2013 ELANTRA GT IN MAY OF THIS YEAR. A WEEK AFTER TAKING IT HOME THE TIRE PRESSURE LIGHT WENT OFF WHILE DRIVING. WE PULLED OVER & IMMEDIATELY BLUE LINK SENT AN ALERT TELLING ME A MALFUNCTION IN MY TPMS WAS FOUND & TO TAKE THE CAR TO SERVICE ASAP. TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP & WAS TOLD THAT IS WAS A SIMPLE LEARNING FAILURE. RESET CODE & WAS SENT ON MY WAY. THE NEXT WEEK THE CAR DID THE SAME THING WITH THE TPMS. BACK TO THE DEALER IT WENT.  HAD IT SCANNED AGAIN. WAS TOLD NOTHING WAS WRONG & THEY CLEARED THE CODES THRU BLUE LINK. I WAS THEN TOLD TO JUST IGNORE IT & IT SHOULD BE OK. MOSTLY IT IS JUST ELECTRONICALLY INTERFERENCE. I PARKED THE CAR & USED MY HUSBANDS CAR FOR A WHILE.  I START USING MY CAR & GOING DOWN 295 IT HAPPENED AGAIN. PULLED OVER & BLUE LINK SENT THE ALERT AGAIN.  CALLED THE DEALERSHIP & MADE AN APPOINTMENT. I WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAD A CERTIFIED HYUNDAI PROFESSIONAL TECHNICIAN THAT WAS GOING TO LOOK MY CAR OVER.  AFTER 4 HRS OF WAITING I WAS GIVEN A PAPER ASKING ME NOT TO USE ELECTRONICS IN THE CAR AS THIS WAS CAUSING MY TPMS ISSUE. THEY PAPER WAS DATED MARCH 2007. REALLY? AT THAT POINT I WAS FRUSTRATED SO I CALLED HYUNDAI CORP OFFICE. AFTER AN HR CONVERSATION I WAS TOLD TO TAKE IT TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE. SO THAT FRIDAY OFF THE CAR WENT TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP. AT THE DEALERSHIP I WAS TOLD THAT THE CAR NEEDED AN ALIGNMENT BAD & THAT MY TIRES WERE OVER INFLATED BY 8LBS EACH. SO 3 HRS & A LOT OF PATIENCE I WAS TOLD THE CAR WAS ALL SET.  20 MINS AFTER LEAVING THE DEALERSHIP THE TPMS LIGHT GOES OFF AGAIN WITH THE BLUE LINK ALERT TO SERVICE THE CAR ASAP. THE FOLLOWING DAY BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN. THIS TRIP I WAS TOLD I NEEDED A SENSOR CHANGED. 3 HRS LATER I LEAVE & HALF WAY HOME TPMS AGAIN. THAT'S 5 TIMES NO REPAIR. NOW THEY CAN'T PROVIDE ME A LOANER BUT WANT TO KEEP THE CAR OVERNIGHT. CAR HAS BEEN PARKED FOR 2 WEEKS WAITING. *JB
CONSTANTLY ADJUSTING STEERING TO KEEP CAR ON THE ROAD, BELIEF PROBLEM WITH FRONT END,  TOOK CAR BACK TO DEALER ON THE 18TH OF JUNE, THE RESULTS TOLD TO ME BY DEALER WAS THAT ONE TIRE HAD 60PSI IN ONE OF THE TIRE, AIR PRESSURE WAS ADJUSTED IN EACH TIRE, BUT CAR STILL HAS THE PROBLEM.    LOOKING AT THE HISTORY OF HYUNDAI IT SEEMS THAT THEIR SONATAS AND ELANTRAS HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM FOR AT LEAST 2 YEARS, PUTTING THESE DEATH TRAPS ON THE ROAD.  *TR
THE 2013 HYUNDAI ELANTRA WAS PARKED IN A DRIVEWAY AND TURNED OFF, AND AN ELECTRIC FIRE STARTED IN IT.  IT BURNED COMPLETELY UP.  *TR
I PURCHASED A 2013 HYUNDAI ELANTRA ON JUNE 18, 2012 FROM DICK HANNAH VOLKSWAGEN HYUNDAI OF PORTLAND, OREGON.  WITHIN A FEW WEEKS, I BEGAN HEARING A NOISE COMING FROM THE TRUNK AREA.  I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT ON AUGUST 24, 2012.      INITIALLY, I WAS TOLD THAT THEY TRIED TO USE EPOXY TO FIX THE NOISE AND I WOULD HAVE TO WAIT 36 HOURS (OVER THE WEEKEND) TO LET IT DRY.  ON MONDAY, THE SOUND WAS STILL THERE AND THEY RAN FURTHER TESTS.  I WAS THEN INFORMED ON WEDNESDAY THAT THE CAR HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE COLLISION CENTER IN VANCOUVER FOR FURTHER INSPECTION.  ON THURSDAY, I WAS INFORMED THAT THE VEHICLE WOULD NEED TO HAVE A PART RE-WELDED.  I REALLY WAS NOT TOLD EXACTLY WHAT WAS BEING WELDED AT THAT POINT, BUT THAT IT WOULD NOT BE READY UNTIL THE NEXT WEEK (FOLLOWING THE LABOR DAY WEEKEND).  FINALLY, ON TUESDAY I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO THE SERVICE MANAGER, [XXX] AND WAS INFORMED THAT THEY HAD CONTACTED HYUNDAI TO SEE IF OTHERS HAD ENCOUNTERED THE SAME NOISE.  A HYUNDAI ENGINEER HAD TO COME OUT AND HELP DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.  THEY VERIFIED THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM THE RIGHT REAR SHOCK TOWER.  THEY REMOVED THE REINFORCEMENT CAP AND SHOCK TOWER AND FOUND TWO SPOTS MISSED BY FACTORY WELDER, WHICH DID NOT PROPERLY ADHERE THE STRUT TOWER TO THE CAR BODY AND SIGNS OF RUBBING MAKING THE NOISE.      THEY WERE ABLE TO CLEAN UP THE AREA AND RE-WELD THE PIECE TOGETHER.  THEY REINSTALLED THE RIGHT REAR SHOCK TOWER AND REINFORCEMENT CAP TO FACTORY SPECIFICATIONS.  I AM TOLD THAT HYUNDAI NOW HAS A FILE ON MY CAR.  THE CAR WAS RETURNED TO ME ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 2012.  A FULL TWO WEEKS AFTER I BROUGHT IT IN FOR THE NOISE.    THIS IS CLEARLY A HUGE SAFETY DEFECT AND OTHERS SHOULD BE AWARE OF IT.      INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).*TR

Multiple safety recalls issued for many models of hyundai cars. most recent that affects the 2014 hyundai elantra and other models is faulty ABS system which could result in engine compartment fire while parked or driving. There is no available repair for this problem. I received notice in the mail on 01/03/2024. I noticed that the safety recall was issued in September of 2023. How is it acceptable that I was informed of a serious safety issue 4 months after it was found out? As I stated previously, there is not an available repair for this serious safety issue and fire risk. They are not offering free services to determine if this issue is affecting my car. Seriously negligent of Hyundai.
Recall
There is a significant problem with this car where the check engine and dashboard lights flicker on and then the car stalls and loses all power immediately. This has happened multiple times, including on the highway, which was a significant safety hazard.  Upon taking the car to a Hyundai dealer, they indicated problems with the engine that require an engine replacement that would cost on the order of $8,000-9,000. Upon further research, we found two class action settlements related to engine problems for Hyundai vehicles of this type/age, but Hyundai says this vehicle is not covered due to mileage of 101,400.
Good Morning,  This model and year of vehicle has had so many defects. I have paid hundreds of dollars over simple vehicle factors that Hyundai Manufacturers should really assess while pushing them to the market.  This mode has had many brake light defect all consisting of the electrical wiring. I have changed MANY times the Brie lights bulbs only for them to blowout within a week. This is a roadway safety issue. Worse of all the ENGINE Is Faulty and the vehicles for this specific year tend to seize up or blowout due to the vehicle burning oil WAY BEFORE 3000 miles.  I’ve had to change oil now every month because the engine will literally start making a screeching noise under the hood. Only to realize that the car has zero oil yet zero leaks under 1000 miles of driven. The dealership recently changed my oil and filter and after 1,500 miles I realized the engine making this noise for the 3rd time. I have now filed a complaint with their head office, to only have them dismiss me and not care for the safety of others. I am most definitely not the first person that owns this model and has  been phasing with this SAFETY problem. Please help us out and investigate this matter. This is not ethical practice and we should not be worried about our safety on a manufacturing defect.
Motor failed while driving on the highway at cruising speed and car did not lose electrical power. This Elantra has been properly maintenanced as per manufacturer specifications no check engine or other dash lights present prior to the failure.
MY 2014 ELANTRA HAS THE EXACT SAME ROD BEARING PROBLEM NOTED IN THE RECENT HYUNDAI RECALL THAT AFFECTS THE SONATA, SANTE FE AND VOLOSCTER. YET IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED. I HAVE A FRIEND WITH A 2012 ELANTRA THAT WAS ALSO AFFECTED AND SHE SAID HERS IS COVERED.
THE CAR WAS IN MOTION ON A STREET. IT KEPT JUMPING AND WOULD NOT ACCELERATE, THE STEERING WHEEL GOT REALLY HARD TO MOVE. IT MAKES A CLICKING NOISE WHEN I TRY TO TURN IT ON, WHEN I TURN ON THE CAR WHITE SMOKE THAT SMELLS REALLY STRONG STARTS COMING OUT OF THE EXHAUST AND THE CAR WON'T DRIVE, IF I PUT IT ON DRIVE IT JUMPS A LOT AND TURNS OFF BY ITSELF. I HAVE READ AN ARTICLE IN WHICH MANY USERS OF THE HYUNDAI ELANTRA FROM THE YEARS 2011 TO 2015 HAVE THIS SAME MOTOR ISSUES. SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT WITH THE ENGINE. EVEN BEFORE THIS HAPPENED, THE STEERING WHEEL FEELS REALLY ROUGH, ITS NOT SMOOTH ITS NOT EASY TO MOVE THE STEERING WHEEL ESPECIALLY WHEN MAKING A U- TURN OR TURNING ON A STREET, I HAVE TO PULL REALLY HARD TO MAKE TURNS, I DON'T THINK THIS IS SAFE.  *TR
SINCE I BOUGHT MY 2014 HYUNDAI ELANYRA IT HAS HAD A PROBLEM WITH LEAKING WATER TO THE INSIDE OF THE VEHICLE ON THE PASSENGERS SIDE. APPARENTLY IT'S A LEAK FROM THE AC HOSE AND IT'S CLOGGED? NOW MY FLOOR IS WEAK AND IT IS ROTTING OUT DUE TO THE WATER DAMAGE. I'VE HAD IT REPAIRED BUT IT CONTINUES TO LEAK AFTER SEVERAL WEEKS OF BEING FIXED! I'VE HAD ENOUGH!!! THE WATER ONLY FLOWS WHEN ITS MOVING AROUND ANY CORNER... NO ONE CAN SIT IN THE FRONT SEAT BECAUSE THEY GET A SHOWER EVERY FEW SECONDS!!!
ENGINE KNOCKING STARTED AT 60,000 MILES. THE RODS ARE KNOCKING, AND METAL SHAVINGS FOUND IN OIL PAN.
ON DECEMBER 8, 2017 I PURCHASED A 2014 HYUNDAI ELANTRA COUPE. ON AUGUST 3, 2018 WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY THE CAR STARTED MAKING RATTLING NOISES. I PULLED OVER AND THE CAR SHUT DOWN. I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED. I CONTACTED THE HYUNDAI CORPORATION. I WAS INSTRUCTED TO TAKE THE CAR TO MY LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP. THE HYUNDAI CONTACT STATED THAT IT WAS NOT NORMAL THAT A THREE YEAR OLD HYUNDAI AUTOMOBILE ENGINE SHOULD DIE. THE HYUNDAI CONTACT STATED THAT MY LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP SHOULD PERFORM A PA. PA IS A PRIOR APPROVAL. THE PA WAS PERFORMED AND ALONG WITH THE HYUNDAI DEALERSHIPS DIRECTOR OF SERVICE KEVIN ANDERSON SUPPORT, AND AGREEMENT OF ABNORMALITY, THE PA WAS SUBMITTED. THE PA CAME BACK AS DENIED STATING 'EXCESSIVE MILEAGE'.  THE DIRECTOR OF SERVICE DISAGREED AND RESUBMITTED THE PA. THE CASE WAS ELEVATED TO A HYUNDAI CORPORATE CASE MANAGER BY THE NAME CAMERON. CAMERON REJECTED THE PA AS WELL BUT CHANGED THE REASONING TO 'MILEAGE OVER WARRANTY'. THE WHOLE REASON FOR THE PA IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS BECAUSE THE CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY. I AT THIS POINT ON AUGUST 31, 2018 OVERNIGHTED A LETTER TO THE CEO OF HYUNDAI MR. KYUNG SOO LEE. TO DATE I HAVE RECEIVED NO RESPONSE FROM THE HYUNDAI CORPORATION. IN SPEAKING WITH THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DIRECTOR I WAS INFORMED THAT AT HIS DEALERSHIP ALONE THERE ARE 5/6 HYUNDAI ELANTRAS THAT HAVE LOST THEIR ENGINES. HE ALSO INFORMED ME THAT THE HYUNDAI SONATA HAS AN OPEN RECALL ON THE ENGINE. HE STATED THAT THE ENGINES FOR BOTH THE SONATA AND ELANTRA VEHICLES ARE CURRENTLY BACK ORDERED FOR A TERM OF AT LEAST 1 TO 2 YEARS. IN MY PERSONAL ONLINE RESEARCH I HAVE FOUND COMPLAINTS OF THE EXACT CIRCUMSTANCES HAPPENING TO THE ELANTRA ENGINES: HIGHWAY DRIVING, NO WARNING INDICATORS, RATTLING NOISES, VEHICLE STOPPING, AND ENGINE DEAD.   I AM ENCLOSING THE CEO LETTER ALONG WITH THE PA DOCUMENTATION.

SUDDEN ENGINE FAILURE DUE TO EXCESSIVE METAL. CAR WAS OPERATING NORMALLY ON HIGHWAY WHEN SUDDENLY OIL PRESSURE LIGHT BEGAN FLASHING ON AND OFF. THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY KNOCKING WHICH GOT PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER OVER SHORT PERIOD. ROLLED INTO SERVICE STATION TO FIND ENGINE BLOWN. SERVICE STATION SUGGESTED TOWING TO HYUNDAI FOR EVALUATION. HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP TORE DOWN ENGINE TO FIND "SIGNIFICANT" METAL AND BLOWN CYLINDER. HYUNDAI REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IS A DEFECT.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 HYUNDAI ELANTRA. WHILE DRIVING 35 MPH, THE DRIVER'S SIDE SUN VISOR RELEASED IN A DOWNWARD POSITION INDEPENDENTLY AND DISTORTED THE CONTACT'S VISIBILITY. THE CONTACT PLACED THE SUN VISOR IN THE CORRECT UPWARD POSITION, BUT IT WOULD NOT REMAIN SECURED. IN ADDITION, THE FAILURE OCCURRED WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS NOT IN OPERATION. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE.  THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 40,000.
NOTICED A ODD NOISE COMING FROM MY LEFT DRIVERS SIDE TIRE WHEN MAKING A RIGHT TURN. TOOK IT TOO A MECHANIC. LEFT FRONT WHEEL BEARING WAS SEVERELY DAMAGED. HAD TO REPLACE LEFT FRONT WHEEL BEARING AT 41,000 MILES. THIS CAR HAS NOT DRIVEN ON BUMPY ROADS OR ANY ACCIDENTS.
ON THE ELANTRA GT, THERE IS NOTABLE PROBLEM WITH THE REAR SUSPENSION SYSTEM.  WHEN HOLDING THE VEHICLE IN A TURN TO GO AROUND A CURVE, SUCH AS A HIGHWAY RAMP, THE VEHICLE'S REAR END WILL HOP IF IT HITS A BUMP IN THE ROAD.  I IMAGINE THIS HAPPENS WHEN GOING STRAIGHT AS WELL, BUT IS NOT AS NOTICEABLE.  WHEN GOING AROUND A CURVE, THE BACK AND WILL FISHTAIL SLIGHTLY CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO BECOME UNSTABLE IN ITS PATH.  ON DRY ROAD, THIS DOESN'T USUALLY PRESENT A PROBLEM AS TRACTION IS RESTORED QUICKLY.  HOWEVER, ON A WET OR SLICK ROAD THE SITUATION COULD PROVE TO BE MORE DANGEROUS.  LUCKILY, THAT SCENARIO HAS NOT HAPPENED TO ME.  YET.  THERE ARE VARIOUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE ACROSS THE INTERNET FOR ALL MODELS OF THE CURRENT GENERATION ELANTRA (COUPE, SEDAN AND HATCHBACK).  SOME PEOPLE REPORT THAT CHANGING THE REAR SHOCKS WITH BETTER AFTERMARKET ONES SEEMS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY HYUNDAI.  *TR
I WAS DRIVING MY 2014 HYUNDAI ELANTRA (THAT I HAD ONLY HAD FOR 3 MONTHS, HAD 1,500 MILES ON THE CAR) HOME FROM THE AIRPORT, HAD MY CRUISE CONTROL SET ON 55 FOR THE PREVIOUS 30 MINUTES, AND I NOTICED THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME WAS BRAKING. NATURALLY, I PRESSED THE BRAKE AS WELL TO SLOW DOWN, BUT THE BRAKES DID NOT WORK. THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS HARD AS ROCK AND WOULD NOT PRESS IN AT ALL AND THEREFORE I COULD NOT SLOW DOWN AND CRUISE CONTROL DID NOT DISENGAGE. I KEPT TRYING TO PRESS THE BRAKE AS HARD AS I COULD, BUT THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS HARD AND WOULD NOT WORK AND CRUISE CONTROL KEPT ACCELERATING. I PRESSED THE CANCEL CRUISE CONTROL BUTTON ON MY STEERING WHEEL, BUT THAT DID NOT DISENGAGE EITHER. JUST HAS I WAS SHIFTING MY CAR TO NEUTRAL, MY CAR REAR-ENDED THE LEXUS IN FRONT OF ME. AFTER MY CAR STRUCK THE LEXUS (MY FOOT STILL ON THE BRAKE PEDAL), I FELT THE BRAKE FINALLY PRESS IN AND I WAS ABLE TO SLOW DOWN AND PULL OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. THE BRAKE MALFUNCTION IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION, BUT UPON MY OWN INVESTIGATION, I FOUND A RECALL OF HYUNDAI ELANTRA YEAR MODELS 2007-2011 FOR THIS VERY ISSUE THAT CAUSED MY CAR ACCIDENT.  *TR
The contact owns a 2015 Hyundai Elantra. The contact stated while driving at an undisclosed speed, the vehicle made an abnormal sound. The contact stated that the sound was like an airplane propeller spinning. The contact stated that the following day, while driving out of the driveway, the brake pedal was depressed; however, the vehicle failed to stop as intended. The contact used the parking brake to stop the vehicle. The vehicle was towed to an independent mechanic where it was diagnosed with a failed ABS module. The contact was informed that the ABS module needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The contact was advised to take the vehicle to the dealer for assistance. The vehicle was towed to the dealer; however, the vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The contact stated that the vehicle was repaired under NHTSA Campaign Number: 23V651000 (Service Brakes, Hydraulic) prior to the failure. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure but provided no assistance. The failure mileage was approximately 174,000.

Please note that this is not reporting incidents, accidents, collisions or injuries.  This is reporting actions taken regarding, (previously referenced here), the Important Safety Recall Number 251.   Although this problem was recorded in September of 2023 (please refer to [XXX] ), I only recently received this Safety Recall notice in the mail on Monday, November 27, 2023.   The notice states: "due to fire risk, you are strongly advised to park your vehicle outside and away from structures until the recall remedy is completed."  It also states the car is not safe to drive.  I do not have another place to park my car.  I contacted my local Hyundai dealer several times, urging them to please hold my car until Hyundai fixes the ABS fuse problem.  I was told by the Hyundai dealership that they will not hold my car, while we wait for them to fix the ABS fuse problem. I am asking for your help in having Hyundai hold the car temporarily, as It is imperative to do so for safety reasons. Thank you.

The contact owns a 2015 Hyundai Elantra. The contact stated that while driving at various speeds and making right or left turns, the vehicle inadvertently shut off. After restarting the vehicle, the vehicle operated as designed. The contact stated that failure also occurred while driving straight. The cause of the failure was not yet determined. The local dealer and manufacturer were notified of the failure, but no assistance was provided. The failure mileage was 54,000.
My vehicle is just over 80k miles and has received regular maintenance services. Inspection available upon request. My engine would rattle during idle, stopped at a light, and sounded as if the RPM were increasing. I would have to turn my car off then back on for it to stop. No engine or warning lights. As this became more frequent, I also noticed a very intense shaking coming from the front passenger side of the vehicle while driving on the highway. The shaking was most intense as the car accelerated from 2k-3k RPM. It felt like I could have lost control. On 11/29/22, my car was towed to a repair shop because the engine would stall when I started my car. After examination they recommended I take it to a Hyundai dealer, determined the engine may need replaced and informed me of other recalls from similar models. When the vehicle was brought to the Hyundai dealer, they stated they could not replicate the issue - the engine would start without stalling - but they also speculated my problem was from a loose cable, and attempted to send my car home with me the same day. It is important to note that the battery cable was examined and was connected prior to bringing it in to the dealer. My car is not under recall so my request was taken lightly, they stated I had no engine issues. I pressed for them to address the rattling of my vehicle, for which they then told me I had a leak in my front left axle. Axle was repaired and car brought home. My car drove for about 212 miles before it started stalling again with multiple attempts to start it. When I was able to successfully turn the engine over, I drove it back to the Hyundai dealer on 1/02/23. They found no codes but determined the crank sensor needed replaced. After replacement, they informed me my vehicle still “acted up” once, so they have held onto the vehicle for the past month, letting it sit and occasionally test driving it. Still no answer to this irregular issue.
i only have 4,100 miles on my vehicle.  several months ago i was driving and i could not go over 40 mph, even putting the pedal to the floor. NO WARNING LIGHTS EVER CAME ON, could not find the transmission plug to check that fluid. brought to the dealer even though vehicle was running okay several days later to find out why this happened.  their machine did not pick up anything wrong.  i only do city driving so i rarely go over 40 mph.  dealer blamed bad gas.  could it be possible that because i hardly ever go over 40 the vehicle put itself in limp mode. dealer did not check my transmission fluid even though i asked them to. the us postal service sends me pics of the mail i will receive for that day.  around june 14 2022 it showed a letter from 2015 hyundai elantra official business penalty for private use 300 important vehicle information address change? please contact our customer service dept- can you please send me that letter
WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY APPROXIMATELY 68 MILES PER HOUR I NOTICED AN ODD SKIPPING IN THE STEERING. EVENTUALLY THE POWER STEERING WAS GONE AND A STEERING WARNING LIGHT AS WELL AS THE TRACTION CONTROL WARNING LIGHT CAME ON. WE DROVE TO A GAS STATION, TURNED IT OFF AND WHEN IT WAS RESTARTED, THE POWER STEERING RETURNED. THE SKIPPING CONTINUED AND WE HAVE HAD 2 MORE INSTANCES OF THE POWER STEERING GOING OUT, BOTH TIMES AT SLOW SPEEDS WHICH MADE IT INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO STEER. I CALLED HYUNDAI AND THEY EXPLAINED THAT I NEED TO TAKE THE CAR TO GET LOOKED AT BY A CERTIFIED HYUNDAI SERVICE TECHNICIAN.  WHEN I REACHED OUT TO THEM, THEY EXPLAINED THAT I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC PAYMENT AS WELL AS ANY REPAIR COSTS SINCE MY WARRANTY JUST EXPIRED AND THERE ARE NO RECALLS FOR THIS ISSUE ON THIS MODEL.
WE JUST BOUGHT THE CAR TWO MONTHS AGO FROM A USED CAR DEALERSHIP. MY SON WAS DRIVING WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN ALL OF THE DASH LIGHTS FLASHED ON THE CAR AND THE CAR STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. WE HAD IT TOWED TO A CAR DEALERSHIP NEARBY AND THEY LOOKED AT THE ENGINE AND SAID THAT THE ENGINE LOCKED. ALSO, WHEN YOU OPEN UP THE HOOD OF THE CAR THERE'S ALSO OIL ON THE INSIDE OF THE HOOD OF THE CAR.
MY ENGINE BEGAN MAKING A CLICKING NOISE IN JANUARY 2019. I DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT. THEN THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, THE OIL PRESSURE LIGHT AND THE BATTERY LIGHT ALL WOULD START FLASHING WHEN I WAS DRIVING AND MY ENGINE WOULD DIE. I TOOK IT TO MY CAR DEALERSHIP, WHO SAID THEY COULDN'T TELL ME WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT, BUT THAT IT WAS COVERED UNDER MY WARRANTY SO THEY ARE REPLACING IT. I HAVE LOOKED ONLINE AND NOTICED MANY OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT CARS BUT I DO KNOW THAT AN ENGINE TOTALLY DYING AT 58,000 IS NOT GOOD. THEY DID MENTION THAT THEY WOULD CHECK THE OIL FOR METAL SHAVINGS. I LOOKED THAT UP ONLINE, WHICH HAPPENS WHEN AN ENGINE IS POORLY MADE AND THE MOTORS ARE SCRAPING AGAINST EACH OTHER, PRODUCING METAL SHAVINGS, WHICH THEN GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE ENGINE THROUGH THE OIL. EVERY TIME THE ENGINE DIED I WAS DRIVING ON A SIDE STREET, GOING ABOUT 30 MPH.
MY 2015 ELANTRA STARTED TO MAKE A TICKING NOISE WHILE PARKED AND WHILE ACCELERATING AT 50,000 MILES. THERE WAS NO NOTICEABLE CHANGE IN DRIVING PERFORMANCE AND NO DASHBOARD LIGHTS TURNED ON. WITHIN A WEEK I BROUGHT IT TO A HYUNDAI DEALER FOR AN OIL CHANGE AND TO DIAGNOSE THE NOISE. I WAS TOLD THE OIL HAD METAL SHAVINGS IN IT AND THE ENGINE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. I HAVE HAD REGULAR MAINTENANCE AND OIL CHANGES PRIOR TO THIS.
THE STEERING SYSTEM DEVELOPS A STICKY/DEAD ZONE THAT FEELS LIKE A NOTCH IN THE STEERING, RESULTING IN THE INABILITY TO KEEP THE CAR STRAIGHT ON THE HIGHWAY.  IT REQUIRES A BIT OF FORCE TO MAKE MICRO CORRECTIONS OR TO GET PAST THAT HARD RESISTANCE.  IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP THE CAR STRAIGHT ON THE HIGHWAY.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 HYUNDAI ELANTRA. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 50 MPH, THE TIRE (NEXEN CP671, MODEL NUMBER P21545R17) EXPERIENCED A DOUBLE BLOW OUT (FRONT AND REAR DRIVER SIDE TIRES).  THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER. THE WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED.  THE MANUFACTURER AND DEALER WERE NOTIFIED. THE FAILURE HAS RECURRED APPROXIMATELY FOUR TIMES. ADDITIONAL TIRE DETAILS WERE UNAVAILABLE. THE VEHICLE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 2,000.
I own a 2016 Elantra with around 140,000 miles and the car just stopped going forward the car only goes in reverse, no warning light came on, no other issues or warnings that there was something wrong with the car.
The contact daughter owns a 2016 Hyundai Elantra. The contact stated that while her daughter was driving at an undisclosed speed, the vehicle stalled with the check engine warning light illuminated. The vehicle was able to restart after 5 minutes. The vehicle was towed to the dealer where is it was diagnosed with engine failure, and that the catalytic converter failed due to oil entering from the engine. The contact was informed that the engine and catalytic converter and engine needed to be replaced. The vehicle was repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and a case was opened. The failure mileage was approximately 80,000. The VIN was not available.
AFTER MY OIL CHANGE 2500 MILE LATER THE DRAIN PLUG FELL OUT FOR NO REASON
My car was stolen out of my driveway, taken for a joy ride, and abandoned on the side of the road. This year/model of car is experiencing extremely high levels of theft across the nation (e.g, 7K in Chicago alone, and 59,991 nationwide through August). This is due to:  1 - the ease with which it can be stolen with no special tools, due to poor design 2 - a popular "TikTok Challenge" to steal these cars  This presents an extreme public safety concern as:  - the cars are typically stolen by teenagers and taken for joy rides, posing a hazard to other drivers - this can lead to dangerous high-speed police chases - having cars abandoned haphazardly on the sides of roads is a traffic hazard - owners who recover their cars may be unaware of equipment safety issues that may have been caused by reckless driving - insurers are dropping coverage of these cars, which may force lower-income owners to drive uninsured  To date, Hyundai has done nothing to address this issue.
I believe it is the transmission/ power train that failed. It slides gears and the engine stalls.  While driving, I was almost hit because I could not speed up. I had to decelerate in order for the gear to not stutter.
Have 2016 Elantra with just over 65k miles on it, 2nd owner, performed an oil change every 3k-4k miles. Recently performed an oil change and in the oil was an astonishing amount of medal from the interior of the engine. Classic signs of premature engine failure. The car shakes while it’s in idle at a stop light. Performed a 2nd oil change a few days later, and again CHUNKS of medal debris in the oil.
My vehicle is only 5 years old and the transmission has problems. I was driving and the car stopped with an impact force. I thought that someone or something had hit me from behind. For over over 2 months, I have been without a vehicle because the mechanic shop states that the transmission need part replacements.
DRIVER'S FRONT SIDE AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY WHEN CAR WAS HIT AT SPEED (ON THE PASSENGER SIDE) IN INTERSECTION BY ANOTHER VEHICLE RUNNING A RED LIGHT.
THE RED LIGHT HAS BEEN ON SINCE PURCHASE AND HYUDAI SERVICE HAS BEEN SAYING IT IS NOTHING BRUSHING IT OFF.  I

WE WERE DRIVING ON 1-95 HIGHWAY WHEN THE FRONT TIRE DISINTEGRATED AND CAUSED CAR DAMAGE TO FRONT BUMPER, LEFT QUARTER PANEL, RIM, WHEEL COVER, AND DRIVER SIDE WINDOW ASSEMBLY. THE TIRE NAME IS HANKOOK TIRES OPTIMA H-428. THE HYUNDAI ELANTTRA BOUGHT IN 2016 HAD ONLY APPROX. 19,000 MILES.  *TR
AFTER TWO WEEKS OF CONSISTENT STEERING WHEEL LOCKING UP AND NOT BEING ABLE TO TURN KEY IN THE IGNITION I BROUGHT THE CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP ON JUNE 6, 2017.  I ALSO TURNED THE WHEEL COUNTERCLOCKWISE AND DID AS THE MANUAL INSTRUCTED. IT TOOK SEVERAL ATTEMPTS, FRUSTERATION AND BEING STRANDED AT WORK SEVERAL TIMES AND IT FINALLY UNLOCKED.  MY HUSBAND HAD A DIFFICULT TIME UNLOCKING THE STEERING WHEEL AS WELL.  WHEN I BOUGHT IT TO DEALERSHIP IT WASN'T LOCKING UP AND THE SERVICE ADVISOR SAID IT WOULD BE LOOKED AT BUT THAT WAS A VERY COMMON HAPPENING IN THESE VEHICLES. IT WAS BROUGHT TO 6251 GRAND AVE. GURNEE, IL. THE SERVICE ADVISOR WAS JEFFREY VLACH #49715.
VEHICLE SPONTANEOUSLY IGNITED 4/5/2016 @ ~3:45PM (SEE PICTURES ATTACHED) WHILE PARKED IN A FENCED, GUARDED, PRIVATE CORPORATION EMPLOYEE PARKING LOT, DESTROYING ITSELF & BOTH VEHICLES PARKED ON EITHER SIDE OF IT. 5 MONTHS OLD, 11,000 MILES ON ODOMETER, ONLY PRIOR SERVICES WERE OIL CHANGES AT 3K & 10K @ WALMART & JIFFY-LUBE.
The vehicle has experienced ongoing powertrain and electrical malfunctions over several months. The most common symptoms include being stuck in 4th gear (limp mode), complete loss of RPM and speedometer readings, and illumination of the check engine and ESC lights. Most recently, while traveling at approximately 10 mph, the vehicle experienced a sudden loss of both acceleration and braking. The brake pedal became stiff and unresponsive, and the car had to coast to a stop without driver control. This posed a serious safety risk to myself and nearby traffic.  These issues have persisted across multiple service visits to Ricart Hyundai in Groveport, Ohio. That dealership has replaced the crankshaft position sensor three times, the powertrain control module (PCM), and the battery, but the underlying problems remain unresolved. A technician at the dealership was able to reproduce the stalling event during a test drive.  Despite that, the dealership has refused to proceed with further diagnostics unless I pay for an oil change, even though previous inspections by their own staff found no visible leaks and confirmed the oil level was sufficient at the time. They have also revoked complimentary access to a loaner vehicle despite the unresolved and unsafe condition of the car.  The vehicle remains available for inspection. The problem has been confirmed by a dealership, has occurred repeatedly, and continues to pose a safety concern. Warning lights and gauge failures typically appear when the issue occurs.
Engine light keeps coming on... took back to dealer twice coil misfiring had to be replaced  Car was bought in 2018 Coils were replaced twice in 2020 because of check engine light and car not running   In 2024 coils had to be replaced again because of engine failure   2025 blinking check engine light on again engine failed needs to be replaced   Maxon Hyundai refused to replace the engine.,. Car has 86,000 miles  Does not meet the 100000 threshold
The cars just stops running as you are driving.  It's happened multiple times. We've changed the crankshaft sensor & cleaned the fuel system.  We saw these remedies online as multiple people are having this same problem with their Hyundai.
Power steering is loose or tight. It turns off while driving. Clunky sounds when it's working.
Loss of engine power, car shuts abruptly off while driving. increases the risk of a crash and death. Less than a year after I purchased my car from the dealer. My check engine light would turn on and off frequently. Secondary mechanics couldn’t diagnosis problem engine check would show unnecessary/ different codes. Car  burns oil at a very fast rate. Shut of three times while driving yesterday on the LIE. I am scared for myself and my families safety. I can’t afford a new engine or car. Please help The 2017 Electra SE has many recalls for make and model. My vin isn’t under recall.
The Issue started back in December of 2023.The Engine failed while driving to Lake Worth, TX. Vehicle Information: Model is a 2017 Hyundai Elantra Limited 2.0 Engine, US Built. Mileage during the1st incident was at 100,125 miles and the VIN Number is [XXX] . I was on a Maintenance plan the first 2 years with Clay Cooley Hyundai of Dallas with Dealership Warranty when I first purchased the vehicle back in 2017 so I kept up maint.Stalling began & was making a significant tapping noise.Dgnstcs were performed and I initially got Misfire codes P0303, P0300 &P0301. Ignition coils and sprk plugs were observed and replaced. Instantly following I ran another diagnostic and began receiving Camshaft codes P011.The VVT Solenoids were also replaced and this still did not resolve the issue. I was losing oil after every oil change and the oil was not lubricating the engine. I then took to a local shop and they said engine was beyond repair and had it towed to dealership. loud knocking noise from the engine that increases in frequency as the engine rpm increases. Then there is Reduced power and/or hesitation and vibration. With these issues the Illumination of the “check engine and Engine Oil Pressure” light come on in the instrument cluster. Safety Concerns: Stalling and Shutting off of the engine while driving at accelerated speeds is a Dangerous Manufacturing issue that could have resulted in a major car crash not only jeopardizing our safety but the safety of other drivers. Similar Incidents: There have been several reports and forums that we have read that report the same issues with their Elantras. Impact on You: This has impacted me Tremendously as the Dealership states that they cannot assist with the Damages and that I would have to come of pocket by paying over $8,000 to replace the engine. Financially this is beyond my means in what I can afford and stalls my primary source of transportation for commuting back and forth to work, taking care of day to day priorities.

The number 3 cylinder threw a rod through the cylinder wall.  Previous to this happening the car HVAC fan wouldnt turn on unless switched to the on position and waited a while then it would suddenly turn on.  It also would randomly shut down, not a stall, or the engine would lose power which happened to me the first shutdown of the engine merging onto the highway creating a huge safety problem.  None of the warning lights were on and the car gave no indication of what was wrong or going on.   The only time I got a warning light was a after the engine threw the rod.  It  shut down multiple times and/or had a loss of power.  The engine only has 130k miles on it.  Has been well taken care of with regular oil changes.  It showed 0 signs before throwing the rod and made no noise.   I'm only submitting it, because I can't be the only one who had this experience and would like there to be a record of it in order to ensure the safety of others and myself  on the road.
The contact owns a 2017 Hyundai Elantra. The contact stated while driving approximately 70 MPH, there was an abnormal rattling sound coming from the engine compartment. The check engine warning light was illuminated. The vehicle was taken to the dealer to be diagnosed. The contact was informed that the connecting rod bearing needed to be replaced. The vehicle was repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The failure mileage was 105,405.
The engine is making weird noises and the vehicle is stalling and is not accelerating. If am trying to accelerate the crank shaft noise is coming from the engine. Koi
I'm having constant issues with my front doors. Last year There was a door latch recall issued for the front drivers side door. I took my car to the dealership to get it handled however my FT DS door was making a clicking sound. It was fixed but since gone back to the dealership twice and now possibly a third time due to FT PGR Door making the same noise.. I keep getting locked out of my car or the doors wont close right. All doors make a clicking sound when opened. Which is one of the reasons I have taken car twice. The main concern is me not being able to get  in the car without having to click on the key fob and doorlatch getting stuck.
Door exterior handle will not open after the car is locked and then unlocked. It takes multiple pulls after unlocking door and door will not open until 4-5 pulls are taken to get door open.
White paint peeling from front quarter panel, hood and roof
Rear drivers side door  Will not open from inside nor outside when unlocked by either key fob or door unlock control on front door panel???!!! Cannot open if there is an accident… Window opens with both windows buttons. Door will not open when unlocked… Also my passenger side front door has similar issue except, I can open door from inside but not from outside???!!! Key fob does not unlock the door???!!! But front drivers door opens all the time… Very disappointed with this vehicle.
The contact owned a 2017 Hyundai Elantra. The contact stated while driving approximately 45 MPH, the fuel warning light flickered and the radio activated and deactivated independently. The vehicle was taken to a dealer where it was determined that the vehicle was performing as designed due to a satellite not being connected. On another occasion, the vehicle accelerated on its own and the brake pedal hesitated to respond. The contact depressed the brake pedal to the floorboard in order for the vehicle to come to a stop.  The vehicle was taken to another dealer due to the above failures; in addition to shuttering and jerking while depressing on the accelerator, as if it was not receiving fuel. The vehicle was not repaired. The contact did a private diagnosis which indicated electrical system malfunction. The contact was informed to start using a halo battery charger to jump the vehicle. The contact then stated while driving at approximately 40 MPH at night, the vehicle started accelerating inadvertently, and she then turned on high beams for better visibility to pull over safely; however, they failed. The contact then pulled her emergency brakes and ended in a ditch. All air bags deployed. The contacts phone and alert device did not operate. The contact was able to call her son, who called 911. The police, fire, and paramedics arrived on the scene. The fire department cut the contact out of the destroyed vehicle. There were no medical treatments on the scene. The contact was transported to the hospital. The entire driver's side of the vehicle from the front end to the back rear and the entire front of the vehicle was destroyed. The contact experienced a bad concussion and blacked out. The vehicle was towed to the wrecking yard. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 44,000.
Car has failed to turn over/start on numerous occasions. It will take multiple times to turn over before it fires up. Car has also been very jerky in 1st gear aka going slow. Rough jerking spasms at 10mph or such.  Car has also lost power numerous times while driving at high speeds.
The contact owns a 2017 Hyundai Elantra. The contact stated the rear passenger’s side door failed to open. The contact stated no warning light was illuminated. The contact took the vehicle to an independent mechanic and was informed that the rear passenger’s side door latch needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The contact stated that shortly afterward, the front passenger’s and front driver’s side doors failed to open. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. A dealer was not contacted. The manufacturer had not been informed of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 90,000.
The rear drivers side door will not open from inside or outside. The lock works when car is in gear but the door will not open!
Left a location driving my vehicle normally the check engine light comes on, then my vehicle loses acceleration and then my vehicle stalls and I almost didn’t make it home.
The driver rear door will not open from the inside or from the outside. No matter how you lock/unlock it when you pull either door handle nothing happens basically leaving a rear seated passenger trapped.
I have a 2017 pearl white Elantra and The paint is peeling off on my hood and my roof. The car is only 4 years old and I just hit above 30000 miles when this issue started. Even a coworker of mine who has the exact same car is having the same issue and her car basically has no paint left. Many people are having this issue and it’s disappointing that Hyundai won’t compensate their customers to get it fixed. Every time my car gets wet it gets worse it’s really ridiculous and looks TERRIBLE. Way too expensive to fix.
**NON SAFETY ISSUE** Purchased my 2017 Hyundai Elantra SE (Pearl White) used back in August of 2019 with around 30,000 miles on it. No issues at all. After one year back in summer of 2020 I got out my car and noticed a chunk of paint missing from my roof (around the size of half a football). I was immediately concerned. I contacted the dealer I got it from, they advised me to contact Hyundai so I contacted my local Hyundai dealer and they told me I was over the 30,000 mile paint warranty, nothing could be done but they could get me an estimate. I did some research, found tons of articles with tons of people having the same issue, same location on same vehicle, same color. I also found a article about a lawsuit filed against Hyundai for Elantra's year 2009-2016 for paint issue. I saw Hyundai won based off the fact they offer a 30,000 mile paint warranty. This scared me away from trying to pursue Hyundai so I waited a bit and hoped to see if a recall would be issued. Then maybe 4 months ago I went to wash my car and after hitting it with water a softball size chunk of paint chipped off my driver door. I then contacted Hyundai and asked that something be done. Hyundai's body shop wrote an estimate and submitted it to Hyundai. It was an over priced estimate in my opinion so I took it to my local (and well respected) body shop and they wrote me an estimate for exactly half the cost. Hyundai then responded they would cover half the cost. But only at a Hyundai body shop. Either shop I take it to I would owe $1,000 out of my pocket. Unacceptable to me and a lot of money for me. Both shops stated it was a manufacturing defect and I believe the manufacturer should cover the costs. I tried contacting Hyundai's corporate line and they advised me a rep would call me to speak to me about their decision. It has been a month now and no response still. I don't know what to do or who to have help. The car is all but 4 years old and the paint is getting worse daily. I need help.
There was a recall on 3/28/2017 on the 2017 hyundai Elantra for a power steering (eps motor) problem. Recall 161 I recently bought a 2017 Hyundai Elantra used. It showed no outstanding unrepaired recalls on the vin number check. However without realizing there was a former steering recall on my car i have been noticing that my car when steering to the right catches. I mostly experience this at higher speeds and while driving on the highway when changing lanes. As if it snagged on something or i have no control for a microsecond. Its happens and just as quickly goes away when i bring the steering wheel back to the left.I am wondering if the march 2017 recall and my current problem are related. Is there any way of determining if my car was under that recall and whether it was repaired or not. When recall notices on a particular car/vin number are repaired does that info get entered into a national data base . It seems very coincidental to say the least that i am experience a steering anomaly and i now find out there was a past recall for a problem involving steering.  Yet i can't seem to determine if my car was repaired for such a recall in the past
2017 HYUNDAI ELANTRA. CONSUMER STATED THAT BOTH REAR DOORS HAVE MALFUNCTIONED. *LD    THE CONSUMER STATED THE REAR DOORS DO NOT OPEN FROM THE OUTSIDE OR THE INSIDE. *JS
I HAD A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COME ON AND IT WAS RELATED TO THE HEATER CORE OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE,  WHEN I STOPPED TO HAVE A PARTS STORE RUN THE CODE. THEY ASKED ME IF IT WAS OVERHEATING,  I TOLD THEM NO. ABOUT A MONTH LATER THE WEATHER STARTED GETTING COLD AND WHEN I WENT TO DEFROST MY WINDOWS THERE WAS ONLY COLD AIR BLOWING OUT WHEN THE CAR WAS WARMED UP. AS I STARTED DRIVING I WOULD GET WARM AIR BUT AS SOON AS I STOPPED COLD AIR BLEW AGAIN.  I TOOK IN INTO HYUNDAI THE FLUSHED THE COOLANT SYSTEM AND CHANGED THE THERMOSTAT I GOT IT BACK AND THE SAME THING WAS HAPPENING,  TOOK IT BACK THEY THEN REPLACED THE WATER PUMP, GOT IT BACK SAME THING, TOOK IT BACK AGAIN THEY CHANGED THE THERMOSTAT AGIAN, STILL DIDN'T FIX IT, SAME THING WAS STILL HAPPENING,  I AM NOT WAITING FOR THEM TO GET A SPECIAL PART TO APPARENTLY FLASH THE SYSTEM AGIAN, BUT REMOVING AIR BUBBLES.  I HAVE LITTLE FAITH IT WILL FIX IT SINCE IT DIDN'T WORK THE FIRST TIME.
REAR, PASSENGER DOOR WILL NOT OPEN FROM THE INSIDE OR THE OUTSIDE. YOU CAN HEAR THE LOCK MECHANISM WORKING, BUT THE DOOR WILL NOT OPEN NO MATTER WHAT WE DO. THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HAVING WITH HYUNDAIS FOR YEARS NOW. HERE'S A LINK TO A FORUM THAT TALKS ABOUT IT. HTTPS://WWW.HYUNDAI-FORUMS.COM/THREADS/REAR-PASSENGER-DOOR-WONT-OPEN.603329/ THE HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE SAYS IT'S OUT OF WARRANTY, AND WON'T LOOK AT IT WITHOUT CHARGING ME, SO I DIDN'T GET A REPAIR ESTIMATE.
THE DOORS SUDDENLY STOP WORKING... THEY WON'T UNLATCH IF YOU TRY TO OPEN FROM OUTSIDE OR INSIDE.. YOU HAVE TO HIT UNDER THE DOOR HANDLE FOR THE DOOR TO UNLATCH. THIS IS HAPPENING ON MULTIPLE VEHICLES AND IT'S A KNOWN ISSUE AT THIS POINT. (MORE CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS HERE: HTTPS://WWW.HYUNDAI-FORUMS.COM/THREADS/REAR-PASSENGER-DOOR-WONT-OPEN.603329/) THIS IS HAPPENING ON 2 OF MY DOORS. CAR HAS NEVER BEEN IN ACCIDENTS NOR DOES IT HAVE ANY DENTS ON IT. HYUNDAI SAYS THEY WILL NOT FIX UNDER WARRANTY (CAR HAS 65K MILES ON IT) AND THEY ARE CHARGING CUSTOMERS TO FIX IT DESPITE IT BEING A MANUFACTURER ISSUE. THIS IS ALSO A SAFETY ISSUE GIVEN THAT IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT OR A FIRE, THE DOOR MAY NOT OPEN TO GET PASSENGERS TO SAFETY. THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE WHERE IT SLOWLY DEGRADES. IT'S A SUDDEN ISSUE.
MY CAR IS CONTINUOUSLY GETTING CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON AND THE CAR RATTLES.

I THINK THIS NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED AND DESERVE A FULL RECALL FOR ALL THE 2017 HYUNDAI ELANTRA WHO ARE EXPERIENCING ENGINE ISSUES.
YES I HAD BOUGHT A USED 2017 HYUNDAI ELANTRA SEI THEY NEVER INFORMED ME OF ANY RECALLS ON THIS VEHICLE AFTER I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE THE MOTOR BLEW UP BECAUSE OF ONE OF THE CYLINDERS WERE STICKING BECAUSE OF A FACTORY DEFECT THEY REPLACED THE MOTOR THE SECOND MOTOR STARTED DOING THE SAME THING GETTING STUCK AND SHAKING THE STEERING WOULD LOCK UP SOMETIMES WHERE I COULD NOT EVEN STEER OR IT WAS HARD TO STEER WHY EVEN WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR THEY DID NOT INFORM ME OF RECALLS WHEN I TALK TO THE CAR BACK AND HAVE THE MOTOR REPLACED THEY STILL DID NOT INFORM ME OF ANY RECALLS THESE THINGS COST ME TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT AND HIT A TELEPHONE POLE AND TOTALED MY VEHICLE
MY VEHICLE IS A 2017 HYUNDAI ELANTRA WITH 41,000 MILES. I AM THE SECOND OWNER.     ON DECEMBER 3RD, 2019, I WAS DRIVING VEHICLE CAR APPROXIMATELY 60 MPH ON THE HIGHWAY IN TRAFFIC. AS MY FOOT WAS PRESSING ON THE ACCELERATOR, THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN, AND THE RPM NEEDLE BEGAN TO BOUNCE AROUND. I PULLED MY VEHICLE OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND RESTARTED THE VEHICLE. THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS NOT ON. AT THIS POINT THE DEALERSHIP WAS NOT OPEN AND THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS NOT ON, SO I DECIDED TO WAIT TILL THE MORNING TO CONTACT THE HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP. AS I DROVE HOME, I STOPPED AT A RED LIGHT AND THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO STALL. I PULLED THE CAR INTO THE NEAREST PARKING LOT AND LEFT IT THERE OVERNIGHT. THE HYUNDAI SHOP KEPT MY VEHICLE TWO DAYS. THEY GAVE ME A LOANER CAR FOR THE SECOND DAY, SO I DID NOT MISS ANOTHER DAY AT WORK. THEY STATED THE ISSUE WAS 'FAULTY IGNITION COILS' AND REPLACED THE WIRES. IT WAS COVERED UNDER MANUFACTURES WARRANTEE THANKFULLY.    TODAY, DECEMBER 12TH, I GOT IN MY VEHICLE TO GO TO WORK AND THE VEHICLE SHOOK WHEN I STARTED IT. THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON IMMEDIATELY AND I CALLED THE MAINTENANCE SHOP. THEY HAD A LOANER FOR ME WAITING, AND I AM NOW WAITING TO HEAR WHAT IS WRONG WITH IT THIS TIME. I HAVE PUT ON APPROXIMATELY 400 MILES ON THE VEHICLE IN THE LAST 4 DAYS.
WHILE TRYING TO INCREASE SPEED TO GET ON HIGHWAY THE RPM INCREASED BUT MY CAR WOULD NOT SPEED UP. HAS HAPPENED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.
ON AUG 26, 2018 THE CAR STARTED MISSING WHILE DRIVING.  IGNITION COIL WAS FOUND TO BE FAULTY AND REPLACED BY THE DEALER. THIS WAS THE SECOND INCIDENT INVOLVING AN IGNITION COIL WITH THIS VEHICLE.
DOORS WILL NOT OPEN HAVE TO PULL THE HANDLE 5 OR 6 TIMES FOR THE DOOR TO FINALLY OPEN THE PASSENGER DOOR WILL NOT OPEN AT ALL FROM THE OUTSIDE YOU HAVE TO OPEN IT FROM THE INSIDE TO LET YOUR PASSENGER IN THE CAR. THE BACK DOOR ON DRIVER SIDE WILL NOT OPEN FROM THE INSIDE OR THE OUTSIDE ONLY THE DRIVER SIDE FRONT DOOR AND BACK PASSENGER DOOR WILL OPEN FROM THE OUTSIDE  THE OTHER 2 DOORS EITHER WILL NOT OPEN AT ALL OR ONLY FROM INSIDE. IF WE WAS JUST HAVE AN ACCIDENT OR IF IT WAS TO CATCH FIRE WITH US INSIDE THEY WOULD HAVE TO BREAK THE WINDOWS OR CUT US OUT OF THE VEHICLE BECAUSE NONE OF THE DOORS WORK PROPERLY. THE DRIVER DOOR YOU HAVE TO HIT UNLOCK AND JERK THE HANDLE  BOUT 5 OR 6 TIMES THEN IT WILL OPEN FINALLY. I'VE TOOK DOOR PANELS OFF EVERYTHING IS HOOKED UP AND IN WORKING ORDER SO IT'S GTA BE A MALFUNCTION WITHIN THE LOCKS OR SOMETHING I CAN'T FIGURE WHAT ELSE IT CAN BE.
I HAVE HAD A TON OF ISSUES. MY BLIND SPOT SENSORS ONLY WORK OCCASIONALLY. (I ACTUALLY KNOW SOMEONE ELSE WITH A HYUNDAI THAT IS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM). ADDITIONALLY, SENSORS GO OFF AT RANDOM. I HAVE HAD THE WARNINGS FOR FLAT TIRE POP UP MULTIPLE TIMES WHEN THERE WAS NO FLAT TIRE. ONE OF THE TONES MY STEERING WHEEL ACTUALLY LOCKED UP AND I WAS UNABLE TO DRIVE. I HAVE ALSO HAD ISSUES WITH MY RADIO SCREEN AND THE RADIO PLAYING. MY PUSH TO START BUTTON ALSO HAS ISSUES. SOMETIMES IT WILL NOT TURN THE WHOLE CAR OFF. THEY REPLACED SOMETHING IN THE BOTTOM BUT IT IS STILL HAPPENING. TODAY IT ACTUALLY HAD A HARD TIME STARTING. THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE I GOT THE CAR. I'VE HAD IT LESS THAN A YEAR AND IT HAS BEEN TO THE SHOP A COUPLE DOZEN TIMES. THIS HAPPENS AT ALL TIMES BOTH WHEN I'M MOVING AND NOT MOVING DEPENDING ON THE ISSUES. IT HAS ALSO HAPPENED WHEN I WAS DRIVING SLOWER AND FASTER. MY SCREEN HAS ALSO FROZEN AND I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO USE IT. BOTH IN MOTION AND PARKED. P

Our hyundai elantra 2018 car started with a knocking sound while we were driving and it got worse our of nowhere when we accelerated and suddenly did this throttling sound with a pop. The battery light came on, the engine light came on and suddenly our car engine turned off and we were able to go on the side of the street we were on. Fumes were coming out of the hood and oil began to leak. The car was not able to be turned on to move it. We have towed it to our home, our local mechanic told us it was the engine. It has 135,000 miles on it. We got it from the dealership about 5 years ago and had not had issues until suddenly our engine blew!
MY 2018 HYUNDAI ELANTRA SHUTS OFF WHILE DRIVING. THE ENGINE AND OIL LIGHTS COME ON AND THE CAR WILL SHUT OFF ANYWHERE WHILE I AM DRIVING AS OF APRIL 02, 2023. I HAD TAKEN MY 2018 HYUNDAI ELANTRA TO THE DEALER TO HAVE THE CRANK SENSOR REPLACED AND THEY COMPLETED THE REPLACEMEMT TODAY, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 09, 2023. NOW MY 2018 HYUNDAI SHUTS OFF MORE OFTEN THAN BEFORE. I WAS TOLD BY THE HYUNDAI CORPORATION OFFICE TO TAKE MY VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALER AND INFORM THEM THAT MY 2018 HYUNDAI ELANTRA IS SHUTTING OFF MORE FEQUENTLY THAN BEFORE....AS OF TODAY, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 09, 2023.
Engine seizes or stalls shutting off the car completely and randomly. This puts myself and passengers and other on the road at serious risk of injury or death due to not being able to maintain speed or control of vehicle. It is available for inspection upon request. It has been an ongoing issue since 2020 and the dealership has “fixed the issue” twice. It is not fixed as it keeps happening. They deny any further issues and claim they cannot replicate the issue. I drove it from the lot again today after they “fixed” it and had it shut off on my way home. There has not been a check engine light that comes on in the past however this time it did making today the first time the check engine light came on. The check engine light came on before the car shut off while driving home from dealership. I put date of occurrence as of today but the first time it happened was back in 2020.  It will shut off while at a stop light or even going 45 mph. I am unsure of how many miles were on the car at first occurrence. I think around 20 or many 30k
While driving, the acceleration stopped working and loud clanging noises were heard in the engine.  There were no warning lights, nothing.  I was driving on a busy road and the lack of acceleration created a major safety hazard for me and the vehicles around me.  I eventually pulled over and restarted the car.  It happened three more times on the way home.  I got the car to my local mechanic and he said that it was the engine and it needed to be replaced.  He saw this many times before on this model and told me to bring it to the dealer.  I had the car towed to the Hyundai dealer/service center in Milford, Connecticut.  I am waiting for them to look at it.  I know that this has happened to many others with a 2018 Elantra and I am very upset that the car failed.
The car is very easy to steal. Company I work for had to hire security to stand at the gates because of so many thefts. They call themselves "The Kia Boys". The cars are so easy to steal that kids 13 and younger are stealing them. There is even a tik tok video that went viral showing how steal them quickly. Hyundai refuses to issue recall saying only that the newer models won't have same problem, but that doesn't help people who are losing their vehicles that are still paying on them. These teenagers are wrecking the cars and getting killed. And some have also been killed by the people they're stealing from. https://www.google.com/amp/s/abc6onyourside.com/amp/news/local/columbus-police-homicide-of-teen-is-linked-to-operation-game-over-car-theft-ring  https://www.google.com/amp/s/jalopnik.com/two-thirds-of-milwaukee-s-stolen-cars-are-made-by-kia-o-1848174995/amp
White paint peeling in less than 3 years of ownership.  Jenkins Hyundai of Leesburg said they would put in a claim, but they have been non-responsive after saying they would put in a claim.  No action from the dealership.  The manufacturer, Hyundai, who painted the car, has also not taken any action, and have deferred the problem to the dealership.  The paint should have been covered under warranty.
WHEN THE VEHICLE IS TURNING RIGHT OVER UNEVEN SURFACES (OR BUMPS), THE VEHICLE MAKES CRUNCHING/CREAKING SOUNDS THAT MAY SUGGEST SUSPENSION ISSUES OR FEAR OF DRIVING THE VEHICLE. DEALER DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE AND UNABLE TO REPAIR. IT WOULD APPEAR RELATED TO ENGINE MOUNT RUBBER THAT CAN REDUCE NOISE IF APPLYING LUBRICATING SPRAYS, BUT UNSURE IF ANY AFFECT TO VEHICLE SAFETY.
WARNING LIGHT FOR TIRE PRESSURE COMES ON EVERY 4 TO 5 DAYS. TIRE PRESSURE GOES DOWN, EVEN AFTER TIRES HAVE BEEN ROTATED.
WHEN ACCELERATING WITH MODERATE TO HEAVY THROTTLE INPUT, THE ENGINE EMITS EXCESSIVE PINGING AND RATTLES NOISES. IT SOUNDS LIKE "SPARK KNOCK". NO MATTER WHAT BRAND OF FUEL OR OCTANE I RUN THE CAR ON, THE ENGINE MAKES THESE PINGING AND RATTLING NOISES. I'VE BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPT. TWICE SO FAR TO ADDRESS THIS CONCERN. I WAS INFORMED THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY HEAR THE NOISE, BUT CANNOT DIAGNOSE IT BECAUSE THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ISN'T ILLUMINATED. ON THE SECOND VISIT, THEY TOLD ME IT IS A NORMAL NOISE FOR THE CAR. HAVING OWNED A HANDFUL OF VEHICLES OVER THE YEARS, THIS NOISE IS INDICATIVE OF SPARK KNOCK. IF THE PROBLEM IS INDEED EXCESSIVE SPARK KNOCK, THIS CAN LEAD TO CATASTROPHIC ENGINE FAILURE, CAUSING SUDDEN LOSS OF ALL POWER. AFTER RESEARCHING THE ISSUE ONLINE AND SPEAKING WITH OTHER OWNERS, IT IS APPARENT TO ME THAT IT IS A FAIRLY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE 2018 HYUNDAI ELANTRA SEDAN. I WOULD LIKE HYUNDAI TO INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE AND COME UP WITH A FIX. THIS PROBLEM HAS EXISTED SINCE BRAND-NEW OFF THE DEALER LOT. THE CAR CURRENTLY HAS APPROXIMATELY 4,000 MILES.
PASSENGER SEAT-BELT ALARM WILL GO OFF OCCASIONALLY WHEN NO ONE IS SITTING IN THE VEHICLE.
The contact owns a 2019 Hyundai Elantra. The contact received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 21V301000 (ENGINE); however, the part to do the recall repair was not yet available. The contact was stationed in Guam when the vehicle was purchased. The vehicle was manufactured in South Korea. The contact then moved to the USA, and the vehicle was taken to Colorado however, the vehicle was registered in Florida. The dealer was contacted and refused to repair the vehicle, because the vehicle was considered a foreign vehicle. The manufacturer was not made aware of the issue. The contact had not experienced a failure. Parts distribution disconnect.
Motor is knocking due to recalls. Was not able to make recall appointment because car car isn’t reliable at this point
The engine is locked up
The electrical plate for the right daytime running light must have fallen out of the engine compartment, according to the dealer service center, because it was no longer there.  A warning light appeared on the dashboard system as a yellow triangle enclosing a yellow exclamation mark.  It presented a safety issue by causing the warning light to appear on the dashboard panel while the vehicle was being driven.  The dealer service center informed me of the cause of the dashboard warning light when I took it to them for diagnosis.  There were no warnings prior to the failure.
Car stalls constantly with out warning. Sometimes will start up again and sometimes it wont. Completely stuck where its at right now and i was not notified of the recall for my 2019 hyandai elantra. Bought it from dealer that used it as a rental. I am the first owner.
Drove my car 12 miles from work to father’s house no issues. Started car back up and engine light came on. Called my boyfriend and said light came on and now car isn’t staying on. Tried to drive 4 miles home and every time I stopped at stop sign or light the car died. One time it died as I was going 35 mph. I pulled up to busy intersection and the car died and I could not get it to start. A guy was stuck behind me got out of truck and pushed me through the intersection and off to the side of the road. My boyfriend got there got it started and drove the remaining 2 miles home. He changed the oil which was low and had just been changed 2 months ago. The car still repeated the same behavior. My VIN is not included in the engine recall.
Trouble code:P0011 Mechanic replaced timing soliend. On driving car home, the engine began shutting down. Took back to mechanic who stated he could not get the engine to repeat trouble. Continue to drive and see what happens. Continued to drive but engine shut down got continuously worse and there is a sound like a fan blade is knocking against something (best way I can describe the noise)which is intermittent.   Headlights are very dim.  This was noticed late last year.  It got so bad that I started to Google it and found there are other companies about this online including that the high beams don't work at all .
Low beam headlights work fine. When engaging the high beam selector the high beams on both the left and right side do not work. There seems to be a lens that does not actuate to enable the high beams to shine.
My high beams have not worked since I bought the car dealership told me they were recalled. Also steering column grinds whenninturnnthe steering wheel
NEITHER OF THE HIGHBEAMS WORK AND THEY BOTH STOPPED WORKING AT THE SAME TIME IT'S NOT THE RELAY IT'S NOT THE FUSE IT'S NOT THE BULBS.
Both headlights bulbs  needed to be replaced several times. Passenger replacement bulb 3 times. Drivers side twice. I have sent Hyundai several emails and have not heard back from them. case # [XXX]  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
Engine stalled out, oil light and engine repair light both on, call will not turn over
The component which failed was the engine.  This engine has been burning oil from the day in which we bought it.  This engine puts everyone at risk because it failed in the middle of traffic, and We could have been hit by oncoming traffic.  The problem could not be reproduced because the engine tied up in the middle of the road.  We had the vehicle towed to the dealer who said it was not covered under the warranty due to abuse.  The oil had been changed at the proper intervals, and we are sure the engine failed because it was a poorly made engine.  This engine had exactly 69,993 miles when it tied up.  We attempted to have it repaired at 54 thousand miles but the dealer said we need more money to check it out, but when they sold it they said the engine was covered. When we brought it in we asked for a loaner, but initially they refused.  Three weeks later, we demanded a loaner as we happen to see the owner Steve Taylor at the customer service desk and he complied.  After a month and a half without our car getting repaired they said we did not change the oil at the proper intervals, and said we need receipts for every oil change.  We have a fully equipped auto shop in our steel-frame barn in which we replace engines for our Cars-for-Christ fundraiser program, and completed all the oil changes through our own mechanic.  Before we could retrieve our purchase our oil purchase receipts they said, Hyundai will not replace this motor and it is not covered, we can put another engine in your car for 10,000 dollars.  We still owe 14thousand on this car, and 4 thousand of that was for the 2017 Sonata which we bought that failed and we had to trade that to buy this 2020 Elantra.  I have read all the complaints on these engines and they are OIL BURNERS.  We put full synthetic oil in this engine and before it was time to change the oil, it was out of oil.  We had to constantly put oil in this car about 1.5 to 2.5 per month.  Now, we must replace this engine and pay 14k? HELP!!!!!

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2020 HYUNDAI ELANTRA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING AT AN UNDISCLOSED SPEED, THE ENGINE MALFUNCTIONED CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO STALL. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO REGIONAL HYUNDAI LOCATED AT 2380 W KENOSHA ST, BROKEN ARROW, OK 74012, TO BE DIAGNOSED. THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED THAT THE ENGINE WAS FAULTY AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE VIN TOOL CONFIRMED THAT THE VIN WAS INCLUDED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 21V301000 (ENGINE). THE VEHICLE WAS NOT YET REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 44,000.
CONDITIONS: WHILE DRIVING ON A FLAT ROAD SURFACE/TERRAIN, MAINTAINING A CONSISTENT SPEED, AND CONSISTENT PEDAL APPLICATION. IF YOU SET CRUISE CONTROL, THE RPMS WILL JUMP BY 500 OR MORE. THE JUMP IN ENGINE SPEED IS MAINTAINED, NOT TEMPORARY. THE SUSTAINED INCREASE IN ENGINE SPEED WILL REDUCE FUEL ECONOMY AND INCREASE MECHANICAL WEAR ON THE VEHICLE. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN PRESENT SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED BRAND NEW. I DO HAVE A VIDEO BUT THE 5 MB FILE SIZE LIMIT PREVENTS ME FROM UPLOADING.
THIS IS  BRAND NEW CAR THAT I PURCHASED 35 DAYS AGO THAT NOW HAS 1295 MILES ON IT. I ENTERED THE STREET FROM A PARKING LOT, THERE WAS HEAVY TRAFFIC AT THE TIME SO I DID NEED TO EXCELLERATE RAPIDLY WHEN I PULLED OUT. UNFORTUNATELY ONCE I WAS IN THE ROAD THE CAR HAD NO POWER AND WOULD NOT PICK UP SPEED. THE ENGINE RPM WAS INCREASING BUT THE CAR WAS NOT PICKING UP SPEED. CARS WERE ON MY BUMPER BLASTING THEIR HORNS AND I CAN'T BLAME THEM, I'M LUCKY I DIDN'T CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. I TRIED TO MANUALLY SHIFT THE CAR TO SEE IF IT HELPS BUT IT WOULD NOT CHANGE GEARS AND I WAS SLOWING PICKING UP SPEED. I HAD TO CALL HYUNDAI ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE TO COME TOW THE CAR.
High Beam Assist, Check Rear Cross-Traffic Safety System, Check Blind-spot safety system, Check forward safety system, Check Lane Keep Assist System, Traction Control disabled. ALL of those messages came on while driving. Rear backup camera quit working, reverse lights do not engage. No remedy for recall still. Vehicle is unsafe to operate without recall being fixed. This is my only transportation, FIX it!!!
I have had to get the horn replaced on my ELANTRA six times the horn goes out and this can be a very big safety hazard as it has caused people to almost hit me because they didn’t see me and my horn wasn’t working to alert them this needs to be addressed as soon as possible as this could cause someone to lose their life in the wrong instance
Just quit working after being adjusted still not fixed though has been to Hyundai.  Say parts are back ordered for months
NHTSA Recall Number 22V354000 has been active since May 18, 2022. The dealership says no dealers in the area have received the part to fix it. The recall itself carries serious safety concerns as the seatbelt will explode metal fragments in an accident. The dealer has also told me that 35 other people are waiting for the recall to be fixed as well. This is ridiculous, Hyundai needs to get these parts to the dealers.
The contact owns a 2021 Hyundai Elantra. The contact received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 22V354000 (Seat Belts) however, the part to do the recall repair was not yet available.

The contact stated that an unknown warning light was illuminated. The vehicle was not diagnosed nor repaired. The manufacturer was not informed of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 376.
I’ve gotten my horn replaced for the second straight time in the past year. Currently at the dealership and service advisors here at West Herr Hyundai in Williamsville state many horns go bad as of today they’ve replaced 7 of them.
My 2022 Hyundai Elantra SEL's rear parking camera, rear cross traffic warning and Forward colliion warning systems have stopped working a couple of days back. I have checked online for any resolution, and it appears I am not the only one facing these issues. There are a good number of drivers who have reported similar issues.  Hyundai has not issued an recall/fix for these issues and the dealer is unable to tell me if the issue is covered under warranty (I have about 45k miles on my car), unless I pay $220 per issue  to diagnose first. That will get me to near $660 before I know anything about how to fix it.  I would appreciate if you can please investigate these issues in 2022 Elantra SEL.
The contact's wife owned a 2022 Hyundai Electra. The contact stated that while driving at 68 mph and the accelerator pedal was depressed the vehicle collided with a deer. The contact stated that the air bags deployed upon impact. The vehicle was towed to a salvage lot. A police report was filed. The contact's wife sustained neck, left shoulder, and chest injuries that required medical attention. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 60,000.

I was advised of the current recall on my new 22 Elantra. I took my vehicle to the Hyundai dealership where it was purchased (Cookeville) from a mere few months ago. I advised I needed the recall on the seat belts fixed. I was then told that they wouldn't be able to fix this recall for awhile (over a month) because they needed to fix the cars currently on the lot. THE UNSOLD CARS THAT ARE JUST SITTING THERE. Not only is this reckless, it shows a complete disregard to my safety and others that may be in the vehicle or near it if something were to happen while being driven. Mind you, I bought this car completely new from them and have zero issues up until this point. I feel that my vehicle should be given priority over a vehicle that isn't even sold. The Cookeville Hyundai is prioritizing money over public safety and I will as though it should be addressed immediately.
While driving 60–70 mph on [XXX] just north of Sylmar, I suddenly heard a loud, deep “pop” from the lower part of the car. Within seconds, the engine began steaming heavily and leaking oil everywhere. I immediately turned on my hazard lights and began maneuvering toward the right shoulder, crossing multiple lanes with semis and fast-moving traffic approaching behind me.  I felt unsafe and feared the car could catch fire or explode, especially with smoke and oil present. After safely exiting the vehicle, a mechanic later told me the rod bearing blew and punched a hole through the bottom of the engine block, calling it a total engine failure. He said it would require a full replacement and matched known issues with this model.  There was no warning before the failure. I’m having it inspected at Hyundai of Downtown Los Angeles on July 28. I believe this event posed a serious safety hazard to me and others on the road. INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
CAR HAS ONLY 77,000 MILES AND WAS WELL MAINTAINED. ON AUGUST 27, I HAD DRIVEN THE CAR LATE AFTERNOON, PARKED. LATER AFTER A COUPLE OF HOURS WHEN I WENT TO START IT, IT WOULD NOT START, JUMP START DID NOT WORK. MECHANIC REPLACED THE STARTER AND STILL WOULD NOT START. HE CHECKED THE ENGINE AND TOLD ME THAT THE ENGINE HAS SEIZED. I TOOK IT TO THE HYUNDAI DEALER WHO CONFIRMED THAT ENGINE HAS SEIZED. I CONTACTED HYUNDAI AS THE COMPLAINT IS SIMILAR TO OTHER CAR ENGINES THAT SEIZED WHEN DRIVEN  BETWEEN 60,000 AND 90,000 MILES. HYUNDAI MOTORS IS NOT WILLING TO FIX THIS MAJOR ISSUE.
I HAVE HAD THREE EXTERIOR DOOR HANDLES BRAKE OFF THE DOOR ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS..  THE ENTIRE HANDLE BROKE OFF UPON GETTING TO GET INTO THE CAR. ONE HANDLE BROKE WHILE UNDER WARRANTY, THE OTHER TWO BROKE ON MAY 5, 2019. AND JUNE 22, 2019.
WENT TO OPEN OUTSIDE PASSENGER BACK DOOR - OUTSIDE DOOR HANDLE FELL OFF.  WENT TO OPEN OUTSIDE DRIVER'S DOOR - OUTSIDE DOOR HANDLE FELL OFF.
"HANDLE ISSUE" MY VEHICLE HAS AROUND 74K MILES ON IT AND SO FAR EVERY HANDLE HAS BROKEN OFF IN THE WINTER.  AFTER THE FIRST HANDLE BROKE I WAS MORE CAREFUL DURING THE WINTER ON OPENING THE DOORS.  THIS IS NOT A CHEAP FIX.
DRIVING IN TRAFFIC AND CAR STALL ON FREEWAY DOING RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC CAR DIED COULD NOT MOVE GEAR SELECTOR FONDLING WITH KEY BEFORE  IT STARTED WAS FOLLOWED BY A POLICE UNTIL OUT OF DANGER, HAD IT TESTED AT FIRESTONE AUTO REPAIR NO ELECTRICAL PROBLEM WAS FOUND
MY 2010 HYUNDAI SONOTA'S DOOR HANDLES BROKE AND WERE REPLACED ON THE PASSENGERS FRONT AND REAR SIDE BY THE PREVIOUS OWNER A FEW DAYS BEFORE WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE. THEY TOLD US THEY WERE GIVEN A VOUCHER FROM HYUNDAI TO REPLACE THE HANDLES AND THIS WAS DONE AT THE DEALERSHIP. AFTER PURCHASING THE VEHICLE A THIRD DOOR HANDLE BROKE ON THE REAR DRIVERS SIDE. THE DEALER WOULD NOT COVER THE REPAIRS FOR THE THIRD HANDLE. WHILE TRYING TO RESOLVE THE THIRD HANDLE BREAKAGE, A FOURTH HANDLE BROKE ON THE PASSENGERS FRONT DOOR. NOTE THAT THIS PASSENGERS FRONT DOOR HANDLE WAS REPLACED 5 MONTHS AGO AT THE DEALER. I WOULD LIKE THESE HANDLES LOOKED INTO AS A SAFETY ISSUE AND WOULD LIKE A RECALL TO FIX THESE HAZARDOUS DOOR HANDLES. I HAVE A SMALL CHILD IN A CAR SEAT AND NEED TO BE ABLE TO OPEN THE DOOR TO GET THEM OUT.
AFTER DRIVING ON HIGHWAY AND THEN SLOWING FOR TRAFFIC WHICH BECAME STOP AND GO TRAFFIC - THE BRAKE PEDAL STARTED SLOWLY FADING ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR.  AFTER COMING TO A STOP AND PUMPING THE PEDAL - THE BRAKES SEEMED TO RESPOND BUT THEN THE SAME ISSUE REPEATED - HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED AND DISCOVERED THAT THE CALIPERS HAD FROZEN ON BOTH REAR WHEELS (WHEELS WOULD NOT TURN FREELY BY HAND WHEN CAR WAS ON LIFT) AND THE FRONT RIGHT CALIPER WAS BECOMING TIGHT AS WELL.  REPAIR INVOLVES NEW CALIPERS, ROTORS AND PADS FOR ALL 4 WHEELS.
THIS HAS HAPPENED TO AT LEAST 3 HYUNDAI SONATA 2010 AUTOS OF PEOPLE I KNOW.  WHEN ATTEMPTING TO OPEN THE DOOR TO ENTER THE CAR THE DOOR HANDLE JUST COMES OFF IN THE PERSONS HAND.  IN MY WIFES CASE LUCKELY SHE WAS ON OUR DRIVEWAY AND FELL BACKWARD ONTO GRASS AND WAS NOT INJURED.  IF THIS HAPPENED TO SOMEONE PARKED ON A BUSY STREET THEY COULD FALL BACK INTO TRAFFIC.  IN LOOKING AT THE DETACHED HANDLE IT LOOKS LIKE THE POOR QUALITY PLASTIC INTERIOR JUST CRACKED.  AS I SAID THIS HAS HAPPENED TO THREE PEOPLE JUST IN MY CIRCLE OF FRIENDS SO I AM SURE IT IS MORE WIDESPREAD.
DRIVER BACK DOOR HANDLE BROKE OFF.  THIS APPEARS TO BE A COMMON COMPLAINT  BUT THE DEALER WON'T FIX THE HANDLE.  THE BACKDOOR IS NOT EVEN USED MUCH.  *TR
THE DOOR HANDLE CAME OFF WHEN TRYING TO OPEN THE DOOR.  *JS
ESC OFF LIGHT COMES ON AND GOES OFF. MY CAR WONT SPEED UP ON THE FREEWAY WHILE THIS IS HAPPENING AND HAS ALMOST PUT US IN 2 ACCIDENTS. MY ESC OFF LIGHT TURNS ON BY ITSELF AND CAUSES THE CAR TO SLOW WHILE IM DRIVING OR EVEN PEEL OUT IN PARKING LOTS. I FOLLOW POSTED SPEED SIGNS, BUT THIS SWITCH TURNING ON AND OFF ON ITS OWN WITH MY TWO VERY YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE CAR IS VERY DANGEROUS AND EVEN MORE SCARY.  *TR
THE ABOVE INCIDENT THAT I'M REPORTING IS THE SECOND DOOR HANDLE TO BREAK ON THIS VEHICLE. THE FIRST INCIDENT WAS THE DRIVER DOOR HANDLE WHICH BROKE SOMETIME IN 2012. THE OUTER HANDLES JUST BREAK AND CANNOT BE USED TO OPEN THE DOOR. THE DOOR CAN BE OPENED FROM THE INSIDE. JUST YESTERDAY, 5-5-2014, THE REAR PASSENGER DOOR HANDLE ON THE DRIVER SIDE ALSO BROKE IN THE SAME MANNER. THE FIRST TWO WERE COVERED BY THE WARRANTY, WHICH I'M TOLD EXPIRED AT 60,000 MILES. MY CAR HAS 68,000 MILES NOW. SO A TOTAL OF THREE DOOR HANDLES HAS BROKEN, ONE TO GO. IT IS REPAIRABLE, BUT THERE IS A 3 TO 4 WEEK WAIT, FOR THE PARTS, FOR IT TO GET PAINTED THAN GET INSTALLED.  WITH ALL THE COMPLAINTS I HAVE READ ON THE INTERNET, THIS PROBLEM SHOULD BE RECALLED AND METAL DOOR HANDLES BE INSTALLED.   *TR
TWO EXTERIOR DOOR HANDLES, ONE ON THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE AND ONE ON THE REAR DRIVER'S SIDE BROKE OFF IN MY HAND. THIS HAPPENED WITHIN A COUPLE OF HOURS OF EACH OTHER.  *TR
I WENT OUT TO START MY CAR AND IT WOULDN'T START. I HAD TO CALL A TOW TRUCK AFTER A JUMP WOULDN'T WORK. I BOUGHT THE CAR A YEAR AND A HALF AGO AND WHEN THE DRIVER TESTED THE BATTERY, IT WASN'T DEAD BUT IT WASN'T GREAT. I REPLACED THE BATTERY ($95 AT WALMART) AND THE CAR STARTED. FOR A DAY. THE NEXT DAY THE CAR WOULDN'T START AGAIN, WHEN WE REALIZED IT WAS THEN THE STARTER. I PURCHASED AND INSTALLED A NEW STARTER ON THE VEHICLE ($105 ONLINE) ISSUE RESOLVED. PRETTY YOUNG OF A CAR FOR THE STARTER TO GO.  *TR

I had bought this car off Facebook marketplace after confirming with my dad that it was a good car, when I had finally saved enough. After I took it home the check engine light had come on not too long after, the engine stalls when turning the key, pressing on the brake helps start the engine. Turns out the car was a salvage title and my dad didn’t know that and I didn’t know what that was.
Car is overheating. Took it to a mechanic  They replaced the thermostat but car is still overheating, jerking and so much more. The mechanic wants to charge more to fix it. I got a second opinion from another mechanic and after he reviewed the paperwork from the first mechanic. He searched my vin number and told me to contact this number because my vehicle is on a recall list. So I need someone to contact me about where and how we can get my vehicle fixed.
The engine locked up on the highway  My daughter got over to the breakdown lane . We had it towed to a garage and was told the engine locked up — we called Hyundai and got the run around. So we moved on and paid for an engine and got it installed . Then I have been reaching out to see if we could get some type of reimbursement for motor and labor ( something — 91,000 miles when it locked up engine no good) But know I finally got through to a few different people and now they are telling me , because we didn’t go to a Hyundai dealer they won’t do anything. We bought a engine that was from Hyundai [XXX]  And my first claim # from you is  11566045 this is HORRIBLE  JUST LOOK FOR SOME HELP ON THIS  THANKS  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
Dashboard cracked. Completely cracked into small pieces throughout the dashboard.
The contact owned a 2011 Hyundai Sonata. The contact stated that while driving at 35 MPH, both her and her passenger smelled a burning odor inside the vehicle's cabin. The contact then noticed that flames were coming from the front end of the vehicle. The contact immediately pulled over and both her and her passenger exited the vehicle. As the contact waited for a fire truck, the vehicle burned to the ground. No injuries were reported and a police report was filed. The vehicle's remains were towed to an independent tow yard. The manufacturer had yet to be notified of the failure. Upon investigation, the contact discovered that her vehicle was apart of NHTSA Campaign Number: 18V934000(Engine, Fuel System, Gasoline). The vehicle was destroyed. The failure mileage was unknown.
Power steering suddenly stopped working . Tried turning off engine and restarting with no success. No warning lights to indicate anything wrong. Took vehicle to repair garage to investigate. Still waiting for report.
Warning light for airbag continues to stay on , and cruise control does not work at all.
The car suddenly stopped idling while driving at around 40-45 mph and everything seemed normal until it would not drive  but the car was on and then the steering was difficult to pull over to a safe area and the brakes were hard to brake and stop but when it came to a full stop the vehicle dash warning lights were flickering and shut off. When I tried to attempt and start the vehicle it would not start but everything turns on ike normal al the lights  except the engine was not on. Also it started smelling like some sort of electrical components were burning or something but I couldn't see any smoke or anything coming from the engine area but it seemed like electrical burn somewhere in the car. The vehicle is very unsafe to drive since there was no kind of warning lights or sounds and just stopped working while driving. The vehicle is well maintained and up to date with maintenance services. It became inoperable and had to be towed home since I ended up stuck in a unsafe spot in the middle of a busy street and waited hours for someone to tow it back to my house because it was already about 1 or 2 in the morning. The next day had hired a mechanic to come and do the diagnostics and repairs and still doesn't start or drive and I had to hire another mechanic to diagnose the problem again and was told that the motor is seized and I would need a new engine and other work done on it as well and so me and my family are stuck without a car which is our only car and no more money to fix the car and have no way to bring my child to school and also take my wife to work and etc etc since this problem and don't know what's wrong with it after spending so much money trying to have it fixed so possibly a lemon car.
I really don’t know what the problem is. I got my break lights change and they keep blowing out every two to three weeks. I have been changing the bulbs for more than a year now. Every shop I went to say it have wiring problems.

LIGHTS OCCASIONALLY SHUT OFF WHILE DRIVING. HAPPENS ON ITS OWN BUT HAPPENS MORE OFTEN WHEN SWITCHING ON HIGH BEAMS. ALL LIGHTS SHUT OFF INSIDE AND OUTSIDE CAR. HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES SINCE OWNING THE CAR

FIRST I NOTICE A SMELL OF GAS THE SEE A LEAK UNDER THE CAR CLOSER TO DE REAR PASSENGER SIDE BIG LEAK
I HAVE BEEN HAVING INTERMITTENT TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS FOR A WHILE NOW. I?VE HAD THE CODES CHECKED SEVERAL TIMES AND BY SEVERAL PEOPLE, AND EACH ONE SAYS THAT ITS A CODE FOR A FAULTY AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION TEMPERATURE SENSOR. IT CAUSES VERY HARD AND UNPREDICTABLE SHIFTING. WE?VE HAD TO STOP DRIVING IT ALL TOGETHER BECAUSE OF SAFETY CONCERNS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE LAST TIME I DROVE IT I HAD MY 11 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IN THE CAR WITH ME AND THE CAR WOULD NOT SHIFT INTO THE PROPER GEAR WHILE GOING THROUGH A BUSY INTERSECTION, AND WE WERE ALMOST T-BONED BY A LARGE SUV, THE IMPACT WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WHERE MY DAUGHTER WAS AND I HAVE REFUSED TO DRIVE OR ALLOW THE CAR TO BE DRIVEN SINCE. I HAVE FOUND A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS FOR THIS SAME ISSUE ON SEVERAL SITES ONLINE, MOST OF WHICH I HAVE COME ACROSS ON A SONATA FORUM. THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE BY THE MANUFACTURER. THIS IS  NOT SOMETHING THAT IS UNCOMMON AMONG THESE CARS, BUT IT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS, AND THE FACT THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A RECALL ISSUED TO CORRECT IT IS, IN MY OPINION, RECKLESS AND IRRESPONSIBLE. WE PUT OUR LIVES, AND THE LIVES OF OUR FAMILY AND LOVED ONES, IN THESE CARS BECAUSE WE TRUSTED THIS COMPANY/MANUFACTURER TO KEEP US SAFE, AND THEY HAVE FAILED AND CONTINUE TO FAIL BY NOT ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE PROPERLY.  *TR
I WAS DRIVING ON A SIDE STREET, HEARD LOUD NOISE COMING FROM LEFT FRONT WHEEL AREA WHEN I HEARD A GRINDING SOUND AND CAR WAS RIDING ROUGH. CALLED FOR HELP.INSTRUCTED NOT TO DRIVE VEHICLE TILL IT WAS LOOKED AT BY A MECHANIC.  MECHANIC WHO EVALUATED AND REPAIRED VEHICLE SAID HE HAS NEVER SEEN "PITTED WHEEL BEARINGS" IN 30 YEARS OF OPERATION. HE GAVE ME BACK THE FAULTY BEARINGS AND TOLD ME I SHOULD CONTACT YOU AND THE CORPORATE AREA OF HYUNDAI, BECAUSE THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND WARRANTS AN ALERT OR RECALL.  THE DRIVER SIDE LOWER BALL JOINT AND BEARINGS HAD TO BE REPLACED.   PLEASE REVIEW ASAP, AS THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN FOR THE REST OF THE POPULATION. THANK YOU!
ON WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 2020, I WAS AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT WHEN SOMEONE MOTIONED TO SPEAK TO ME IN REGARDS TO MY DRIVER SIDE BRAKE LIGHT BEING OUT. I PROCEEDED TO DRIVE TO MY DEALERSHIP TO GET IT CHANGED OUT KNOWING IT WAS PROBABLY JUST A BURNT OUT BULB. THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE PERSONNEL INFORMED ME THAT THE WHOLE SOCKET WHERE THE LIGHT BULB SITS IN HAD MELTED. THIS CAUSED ALOT OF EROSION IN THE BULB SOCKET AND AFFECTED THE WIRING AS WELL. I FEEL DEEPLY THAT THIS CAN CAUSE A FIRE CONSIDERING THE LIGHT BULB BUSTED AND CAUSED THE WHOLE INSIDE OF THE SOCKET TO MELT. I PAYED $150.00 TO REPAIR THE SOCKET AND WIRING TO FIX THE PROBLEM FOR NOW. I WAS TOLD IT MAY NOT LAST LONG. I'M HOPING THIS PROBLEM DOESN'T LINGER AND CREATE MORE PROBLEMS. I AM VERY CONCERNED ON HOW THESE LIGHT BULBS POP AND MELT EVERYTHING. I WOULD LIKE THIS TO BE TREATED AS A SAFETY ISSUE. PLEASE HELP ME RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND HAVE A GREAT DAY.
SUNGLASSES HOLDER DROPS DOWN DUE TO WEAR IN THE LATCHING MECHANISM, PARTIALLY OBSTRUCTING VISIBILITY IN REAR VIEW MIRROR. THE PROBLEM INITIALLY OCCURRED WHEN IT WAS HOT, BUT BECAME MORE FREQUENT WITH MORE WEAR. APPEARS TO BE COMMON OCCURRENCE BASED ON INTERNET QUERY.
MY DRIVER SIDE COIL SPRING BROKE WHILE TRAVELING AT LOW SPEEDS I HEARD A METAL CLANK AND THEN A PIECE OF METAL FELL ONTO THE ROAD WAY, I'VE HAD MY CAR IN BEFORE TO HAVE THIS PART REPLACED WHEN THE FIRST RECALL CAME OUT IN 2015. AS I LIVE IN WISCONSIN AND I NOW SEE I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO IS HAVING THIS ISSUE OF THIS PART FAILING AGAIN. I CALLED THE HYUNDAI CUSTOMER CARE CENTER AND OF COURSE "MY VIN ISNT SUPPOSELY ONE OF THE AFFECTED VEHICLES"  PLEASE REISSUE A RECALL FOR THIS PART.
2011 HYUNDAI SONATA. MY HEADLIGHTS AND INTERIOR STARTED BLINKING OFF AND ON BY THEMSELVES WHILE I WAS DRIVING AT NIGHT FOR ABOUT A 30 OR 40 SECOND INTERVAL. TOOK TO DEALERSHIP AND HAD IT DIAGNOSED AND THEY FOUND THAT THE THERE WAS AN INTERMITTENT INTERNAL FAULT WITH THE MULTI-FUNCTIONAL SWITCH. JUST GOT IT BACK SO I'VE ONLY DRIVEN IT ABOUT 50 MILES AT NIGHT SO FAR NO PROBLEM BUT IT'S TOO EARLY TO SAY FOR SURE IF THIS FIXED THE PROBLEM TO MY SATISFACTION. THE PROBLEM ONLY HAPPENED ABOUT 3 TIMES BUT IT IS UNPREDITCABLE WHEN THE PROBLEM OCCURS BUT WHEN IT DOES HAPPEN AND IT'S DARK, IT'S NOT SAFE SO WE TOOK IT IN RIGHT AWAY ON THE THIRD TIME BECAUSE THIS WAS THE LONGEST PERIOD OF TIME THAT THE PROBLEM LASTED.  IF YOU'RE HAVING ANY PROBLEM LIKE THIS, I SUGGEST YOU GET IT LOOKED AT RIGHT AWAY, VERY DANGEROUS. IT COST ME $209 TO HAVE IT FIXED. THE VEHICLE WAS MOVING ABOUT 55MPH WHEN THIS OCCURRED. DATE WAS 10-17-2019.
I BOUGHT THIS CAR 3 YEARS AGO. EVER SINCE THE DAY I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE, IT MAKES LOUD CLICKING NOISES WHEN YOU TURN THE STEERING WHEEL LEFT OR RIGHT WHILE IN DRIVE AND REVERSE. IN THE 3 YEARS THAT I HAVE OWNED THIS CAR, I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THE TIRES 4 TIMES, THE BRAKES AND ROTORS MULTIPLE TIMES PER YEAR, TIE RODS, AND CV JOINTS AND YET THE CAR STILL CLICKS WHEN YOU TURN. I HAD THE ENGINE RECALL DONE IN MAY OF THIS YEAR. THEY GAVE ME THE CAR BACK A MONTH LATER. I HAD TO TAKE IT BACK THE VERY NEXT DAY BECAUSE IT WAS LEAKING COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF OIL AND MAKING A CLANKING NOISE THAT WAS NOT PRESENT WHEN I LEFT MY VEHICLE WITH THEM FOR A MONTH. THEY "FIXED" THE OIL LEAK AND TOLD ME THE NOISE WAS FROM MY FRONT BRAKES YET AGAIN. I HAD TO RETURN THE CAR AGAIN A FEW DAYS LATER BECAUSE IT WAS STILL LEAKING OIL! SO THEY "FIXED" THE LEAK A 2ND TIME AND AGAIN SAID THE NOISE WAS FROM MY BRAKES. LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER THAT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME BACK ON. I IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT BACK AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS JUST A "LOOSE GAS CAP" WHICH I NEVER EXPERIENCED PRIOR TO THE ENGINE BEING REPLACED. THEY CLEARED THE LIGHT AND SENT ME ON MY WAY.  I HAD BRAND NEW BRAKES AND ROTORS PUT ON, AGAIN, AND YET THE CLANKING NOISE IS STILL THERE. 5 DAYS AGO, THE CAR BEGAN DRIVING THE WAY IT WAS BEFORE THE ENGINE RECALL, SAME ENGINE FAILURE SYMPTOMS AND MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME BACK ON A SECOND TIME 3 DAYS AGO. I HAVE NOT HAD TO FILL IT UP WITH GAS IN 8 DAYS SO THERE IS NO WAY THAT IT IS FROM A "LOOSE GAS CAP." MY SEAT BELT LOCKS UP AND STAYS LOCKED UP IF I LEAN FORWARD. I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT WHEN I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE I HAD TO INFORM THE MANAGER THAT THE FRONT BUMPER WAS ONLY ATTACHED TO THE CAR BECAUSE SOMEONE DRILLED SCREWS INTO IT TO KEEP IT ON. HE HAD NO IDEA!! I MADE THEM REPLACE IT BEFORE I WOULD BUY THE VEHICLE. THE PAINT IS CONSTANTLY CHIPPING OFF OF THE "NEW BUMPER" THEY PUT ON IT.
POWER STEERING SUDDENLY CUT OUT WITHOUT WARNING WHILE IN MOTION ON THE STREET.  THIS RENDERED THE VEHICLE NEARLY UNUSABLE.
DRIVING ON A BUSY 4 LANE HIGHWAY AT 50 MPH AND MOTOR SEIZED WITH NO WARNING. THIS VEHICLE HAS HAD A MOTOR RECALL AND WAS BROUGHT TO A AUTHORIZED DEALER IN 2016 FOR AN INSPECTION AFTER WE RECEIVED THE FIRST NOTICE. WE WERE TOLD THAT OUR VEHICLE WAS FINE AND NO REPAIRS WERE DONE AT THAT TIME. WE RECEIVED A SECOND NOTICE FOR THE SAME ISSUE A FEW MONTHS AGO STATING THAT HYUNDAI WAS EXTENDING THE WARRANTEE FOR THE MOTOR BECAUSE OF THE SAME MOTOR ISSUE IT WAS CHECKED FOR IN 2016. WE ARE OVER THE EXTENDED WARRANTEE MILEAGE AS THIS VEHICLE IS USED DAILY AS A COMMUTER VEHICLE TRAVELING THE TURNPIKE DAILY AT 70 MPH HAD THIS HAPPENED ON THE TURNPIKE THE RESULTS COULD HAVE BEEN VERY BAD AS MOST VEHICLES TRAVELING THE TURNPIKE ARE TRAVELING AT GREATER SPEEDS THAN 70 MPH. HYUNDAI NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR ALL VEHICLES WITH THIS MOTOR ISSUE REGARDLESS OF THE MILEAGE IT IS A TRUE DEFECT AND SAFETY ISSUE.
I WAS DRIVING MY VEHICLE DOWNTOWN AND MY EPS LIGHT CAME ON ALONG AS WELL AS FLICKERING OF MY LOW TIRE PRESSURE AND ABS LIGHT WHICH I  BELIEVE IS BREAKS FAILING. BUT I HAD FAILURE OF MY POWER STEERING FOR SURE. OUT OF NOWHERE I COULD NO LONGER NAVIGATE HEAVY AND SLOW TRAFFIC. I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND BACK ON ONLY TO HAVE ALL OF MY GEARS LOCK UP AND NOT ALLOW ME TO EVEN ATTEMPT AT MOVING IT, AFTER TURNING IT OFF THE SECOND TIME CAR ENTIRELY DIED AND WILL NOT START AT ALL. WE MANAGED TO GET THE GEARS UNLOCKED AFTER A FEW ATTEMPTS WITH JUST THE BATTERY ON AND PUSH IT OFF THE BUSY ROAD TO CALL FOR A TOW TRUCK. I SEE ONLINE THAT THE 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA HAS A RECALL FOR THE POWER STEERING FAILURE BUT MY VIN IS NOT COVERED BUT I AM DEFINITELY EFFECTED BY THIS RECALL. THE CAMPAIGN NUMBER IS 16V190000
I BOUGHT THIS CAR IN MARCH OF 2018. THEY NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT THE 20 PLUS RECALLS THAT WERE NEVER FIXED. I RECENTLY HAD MY ENGINE REPLACED DUE TO A RECALL. I ALSO HAVE ABOUT 20 RECALLS ON THIS CAR THAT WERE NOT FIXED. AFTER MY ENGINE WAS REPLACED THE HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP CLEARED OUT ALL OF MY RECALLS AS IF THEY WERE FIXED. THEY WERE NOT FIXED OR REPLACED, ONLY THE ENGINE AND FUEL PUMP. THEY ARE TELLING ME I HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR OTHER RECALLS ON THE CAR. THEY CHANGED THE WORDING TO "EXTENDED WARRANTY" WHEN THE PART IS ON THE RECALL LIST. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS SEEING THEY COMMITED A FRADULENT ACT ON ME IN THE PAST ON ANOTHER CAR I BOUGHT FROM THEM.
MY KEY GETS STUCK IN THE ACC POSTION. AND WILL NOT TURN TO THE LOCK POSITION AFTER EXPERIENCING THIS AFTER 24 HOURS I FINALLY WAS ABLE TO GET THE KEY OUT. THE NEXT DAY WHEN I PUT THE KEY IN THE IGNITION IT WOULD NOT TURN TO CIT ON.
MY ENGINE STOPED WORKING IT MARKS THE OIL LIGHT
IN NOVEMBER 2018, WE HAD A RATTLING NOISE DURING LOW SPEEDS, WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE A PROBLEM WITH THE ENGINE (ENGINE SEIZED UP DURING WARM UP INSPECTION BY MECHANIC).  THE ENGINE WAS REPLACED FOR FREE DUE TO AN EXTENDED WARRANTY THAT WAS PART OF A RECALL AND SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH HYUNDAI.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, WHICH WAS FOR A DAMAGED CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND COST OVER $2000 TO REPLACE.  LAST MONTH, WE RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE FROM HYUNDAI STATING " HYUNDAI IS CONDUCTING A SAFETY RECALL IN THE UNITED STATES TO CONFIRM THE HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PIPE WAS PROPERLY CONNECTED BY HYUNDAI DEALERS TO THE HIGH-PRESSURE FUEL PUMP OUTLET WHEN THE ENGINE WAS REPLACED UNDER RECALLS 132 AND 162.

CAR STEERING WHEEL MAKING CLICKING  SOUND WHEN TURNED AND CAR ACCELERATE WHILE COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP IT'S INCONSISTENT ALSO BRAKE LIGHT CONSTANTLY BURNING OUT AND THE CAR HORN RECENTLY JUST STOP WORKING THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST ON MY CONCERN
I BOUGHT A USED 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA IN MARCH FOR MY BIRTHDAY,  AND ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO, THE STEERING WHEEL STARTED SHAKING VIOLENTLY ANY TIME I GOT TO 60MPH OR HIGHER. UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, I FOUND OUT I NEEDED A NEW STEERING COUPLER. BEFORE IT GOT FIXED, MY DOME LIGHTS, AND ALL OF THE BUTTONS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE STEERING WHEEL (TRIP, CRUISE CONTROL) STOPPED WORKING. AFTER BEING FIXED, NONE OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED THINGS WORK, BUT ALSO NOW,MY POWER LOCKS, DASH CLOCK AND HORN STOPPED WORKING.  I ALMOST GOT HIT BY ANOTHER DRIVER A FEW DAYS AGO, AND DIDNT EVEN HAVE A HORN TO HONK!
I'VE HAD PROBLEMS WITH ALL FRONT AND REAR LIGHTS. MAINLY THE HEADLIGHTS, TAIL LIGHTS AND BRAKE LIGHTS BURNING OUT. SINCE I GOT THE CAR I'VE HAD PROBLEMS WITH MY BRAKE LIGHTS NOT LIGHTING UP ON ONE SIDE, THE TAIL LIGHT WILL WORK FINE BUT ONCE I PRESS THAT BRAKE MY PASSENGER BRAKE LIGHT WON'T LIGHT UP. ALSO I HAD MY PASSENGER SIDE BRAKE LIGHT HEAT UP AND MELT THE SOCKET AND HOUSING OF THE TAILLIGHT. ALL LIGHTS BURN OUT WAY TOO SOON LIKE THE CAR IS PROVIDING TOO MUCH JUICE AND FRYING THE BULBS.
BOUGHT CAR 4/2017 5 DAYS LATER ENGINE LOCKED 4/2017 REPLACED BY HYUNDAI UNDER WARRANTY AND RECEIVED BACK 5/2017.

CAR KEPT SHUTTING DOWN NOT WANTING TO START DUE TO GAS PUMP.  I WOULD BE DRIVING AND WOULD START STALLING WHILE DRIVE ALMOST CRASH.  ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS THE LIGHT FLINGER ON AND OFF WHILE DRIVING AND WHEN SWITCH THEM     WITH A LOSS OF POWER STEERING ASSIST, EXTRA STEERING EFFORT WILL BE REQUIRED, ESPECIALLY AT LOWER SPEEDS, INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH.
TAKATA RECALL - IN 2016 THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THE BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH TO BE FIXED ON MY CAR. THEY SAID THAT THEY FIXED IT BUT NOW I AM HAVING THE SAME ISSUES AS MY BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH IS STILL MALFUNCTIONING. MY BRAKE LIGHT STAYS ON THE WHOLE TIME WHEN I AM DRIVING WHICH I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THE BULBS AS THEY WERE BLOWN AND ONE OF THEM HAD MELTED. AS FAR AS I CAN SEE, IF THIS WAS PROPERLY REPAIRED THEN NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPENING. I HAVE TO CONSTANTLY LIFT MY BRAKE PEDAL TO TURN THEM OFF BEFORE I GET OUT OF THE CAR SO THAT THEY WILL NOT BE ON. THIS HAPPENS WHILE IN MOTION AND STATIONARY
RECALL FOR THE AIR BAG CONTROL UNIT STILL HAS NOT BE COMPLETED. THE RECALL WAS ISSUED IN FEBRUARY OF 2018 AND STILL NO REMEDY AVAILABLE.  IN THE EVENT OF A CRASH, THE AIR BAG CONTROL UNIT (ACU) MAY SHORT CIRCUIT, PREVENTING THE FRONTAL AIR BAGS, SEAT BELT PRETENSIONERS, AND SIDE AIR BAGS FROM DEPLOYING. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT A SOLUTION HAS NOT BE FOUND AT THIS TIME. HYUNDAI SHOULD HAVE TO BUY BACK ALL 2011-2014 SONATA'S AS THEY ARE A DANGER TO THE OWNERS.
AIRBAG LIGHT REMAINS ON AT ALL TIMES.

DRIVING TO THE SUPERMARKET WAS FINE BUT WHEN LEAVING THE STORE THE POWER STEERING WASN'T FUNCTIONING SO THE CAR WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO STEER. THERE'S A RECALL FOR THE ISSUE BUT MY VIN WASN'T PART OF THE VEHICLES THEY CLAIM WASN'T EFFECTED.
MY 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA HAD THE AIR BAG LIGHT COME ON.  IT WAS DIAGNOSED AS A BAD SENSOR IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.  TO BUY THIS SENSOR YOU HAVE TO BUY AN ENTIRE SEAT TRACK ASSEMBLY AT A COST OF $1259.00 PLUS LABOR TO INSTALL IT.  AFTER LOOKING THIS UP ON THE INTERNET, I SEE MANY HYUNDAI VEHICLES HAVE HAD THIS ISSUE.  THIS SHOULD BE COVERED IN A RECALL AS IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND BEEN A PROBLEM WITH MANY VEHICLES.
AIRBAG LIGHT WONT SHUT OFF. NO COLLISION INVOLVED
I HAVE NOTICED A VERY STRONG SMELL OF GASOLINE. THE SMELL IS SO STRONG THAT I HAD TO ROLL MY WINDOWS DOWN BECAUSE I WAS STARTING TO GET DIZZY.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE BURNED AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF OIL AROUND FOUR HUNDRED MILES OF DRIVING AND THE ENGINE WARNING INDICATOR ILLUMINATED. IN ADDITION, THE ENGINE MADE A LOUD NOISE WHEN THE OIL WAS LOW. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED, BUT THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. THE VEHICLE WAS THEN TAKEN TO DENNIS HYUNDAI (2900 MORSE RD, COLUMBUS, OH 43231, PHONE NUMBER: (614) 471-2900), BUT THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED AGAIN. THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE EVERY FIVE HUNDRED MILES AND THEN REPORT BACK SO THAT A REPORT OF THE OIL CONSUMPTION COULD BE LOGGED IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 101,000.
BOTH MY REAR LEFT AND RIGHT BRAKE LAMPS KEEP BURNING OUT CONSTANTLY, EVEN THOUGH I'VE REPLACED THE BULBS MANY TIMES.  EVERY TIME I CHANGE THEM, IT IS VERY HARD BECAUSE THE CONNECTOR SEEMS TO HAVE MELTED TO THE HOUSING LAMP.  WHEN I TALKED TO A SERVICE REP FROM THE DEALERSHIP, HE TOLD ME THE WIRING HARNESS WAS POORLY DESIGNED, AND I WOULD NEED A NEW ONE, WHICH ISN'T EVEN COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE, AS BRAKE LIGHTS ARE REQUIRED BY LAW, AND IF THEY AREN'T WORKING PROPERLY, THEY POSE A HUGE RISK TO DRIVER AND THOSE AROUND HIM.  IF THE WIRING HARNESS IS REALLY TO BLAME, HYUNDAI SHOULD OWN UP TO THEIR MISTAKE AND REPLACE IT UNDER WARRANTY, OR THE NHTSA NEEDS TO MAKE THEM DO A MASS RECALL FOR THE SAKE OF EVERYONE'S SAFETY.  I CANNOT KEEP CHANGING THE BULBS AND REPLACING THE WIRING HARNESS SYSTEMS WITH FAULTY DESIGNS AND RISKING GETTING FIX-IT-TICKETS.  I'VE EVEN TRIED BUYING MORE EXPENSIVE LED BULBS THAT PRODUCE LESS HEAT, AND THEY STILL GO OUT AFTER A SHORT TIME.  A SHORT SEARCH FROM OTHER REPORTS SHOWS MANY OTHERS WITH THE SAME ISSUES
TAKATA RECALL MY HEAD LIGHTS FLICKER AND GO OUT WHEN EVERY I USE MY BLINKERS TO MAKE A TURN. IF MY HEAD LIGHTS ARE ON AND I DON'T USE MY BLINKERS WHEN I TURN I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM. I HAPPENS MOSTLY WHEN I USE THE LEFT BLINKER. ALSO, THE LIGHTS ON THE DASH FLICKER AT THE SAME TIME.
TOOK MY CAR IN FOR A RECALL FOR UNDERBODY RUSTPROOFING FOR RECALL CAMPAIGN 946.  WHILE IN FOR THIS RECALL IT WAS FOUND BY THE HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP THAT THE VEHICLE HAD A R/F SPRING THAT WAS BROKEN.  IT REQUIRED IMMEDIATE ATTENTION - UNSAFE TO DRIVE.  I WAS QUOTED A PRICE FOR REPAIRS 220.00 DOLLARS.  I INDICATED TO THE SERVICE ADVISOR AT CARBONE HYUNDAI, 4975 COMMERCIAL DRIVE, YORKVILLE NY 13495, PHONE 315-736-8356,  I THOUGHT THIS REPAIR SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE RECALL.  THEY SAID NO IT WAS NOT COVERED.  WENT HOME AND FOUND A PRIOR RECALL - RECALL 133 WHICH STATES "ROAD SALT MAY CORRODE THE FRONT COIL SPRINGS, POSSIBLY RESULTING IN THE COIL SPRINGS FRACTURING.  DEALERS WILL REPLACE THE FRONT COIL SPRINGS, FREE OF CHARGE".  SO WHY WON'T THE DEALERSHIP HONOR THIS PRIOR RECALL TO REPAIR MY COIL SPRING FREE OF CHARGE????
I NEVER RECEIVED THE NOTICE ON MY CAR  RECALL NUMBER 123. I HAVE TAKEN MY CAR IN FOR ALL RECALLS I HAVE RECEIVED AND I WAS NEVER TOLD THAT THE ENGINE COULD FAIL BECAUSE OF METALLIC DEBRIS WASN'T REMOVED FROM THE CRANKSHAFT. MY CAR IS IN THE SHOP BECAUSE THE MOTOR IS LOCKED. IT JUST STOPPED  AND THEN WOULD NOT MOVE . SOUTHERN STATES HYUNDAI IN RALEIGH IS WHERE I HAVE TAKEN MY CAR FOR ALL RECALLS FOR FOUR YEARS. THEY KNEW ABOUT THIS DEFECT IN 1915, BUT HAVE NEVER INFORMED ME OR DONE THE WORK REQUIRED BY THE RECALL. MY CAR WAS MADE IN ALABAMA AND THE HYUNDAI WEB SITE CONFIRMS THAT MY CAR SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED UNDER THIS RECALL. SOUTHERN STATES IS SAYING THEY HAVE NO RECALL FOR MY CAR BUT ONE SMALL THING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. THEY DON'T WANT TO FIX MY CAR EVEN THOUGH IT IS THERE FAULT THAT THE RECALL WORK HAS NEVER BEEN DONE.
AIR BAG LIGHT COMES ON WITHOUT CAR BEING IN ANY TYPE OF ACCIDENT.  DEALER WANTS TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE CONTROL MODULE.  WHEN RESEARCHING THIS ONLINE, A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF HYUNDAI OWNERS ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE.
THE PLASTIC HOUSING FOR THE BRAKE LIGHT BULB MELTED AND DEFORMED ON BOTH THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE. THE BRAKE LIGHT BULBS BURNED OUT AND COULD NOT BE REPLACED CAUSING A DANGEROUS NO BRAKE LIGHT SITUATION. I HAD TO REPLACE THE COMPLETE TAIL LIGHT ASSEMBLY ON BOTH SIDES. FROM SPEAKING WITH THE DEALER AND RESEARCHING ONLINE I DISCOVERED THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY, THE REAR DRIVER'S SIDE BRAKE LIGHT MALFUNCTIONED WITHOUT WARNING. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE REAR DRIVER'S SIDE BRAKE LIGHT MELTED TO THE POINT IN WHICH IT COULD NOT BE PROPERLY REPLACED. JIM BURKE HYUNDAI OF BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA WAS CONTACTED AND STATED THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL ON THE BRAKE LIGHTS. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 92,209.
MY 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA STARTED HAVING A TERRIBLE KNOCKING  NOISE WHILE ACCELLERATING ON JUNE 3, 2017, AND I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED TO OUR LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP, BAKERSFIELD HYUNDAI, FOR MY SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT YESTERDAY.  I BELIEVE THAT THE ISSUE IS MOST LIKELY RELATED TO RECALL 132/TXX3.    WHAT HAS ME FRUSTRATED IS THAT I TOOK MY VEHICLE IN FOR INSPECTION WHEN FIRST NOTIFIED OF THE ENGINE ISSUES.  AT THAT TIME, MY CAR HAD ABOUT 90,000 MILES AND HYUNDAI CLAIMED NO ISSUES WERE FOUND.  BASED UPON MY CAR'S CURRENT CONDITION AT 116,000 MILES, I BELIEVE THAT THE ISSUE WAS ALWAYS THERE, JUST NOT IDENTIFIED BY HYUNDAI CORRECTLY.  THIS PLACED ALL DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS IN MY HOUSEHOLD AT CONSIDERABLE RISK.  IN FACT, THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY VEHICLE OF MY TEENAGE SON!  AS A NEW DRIVER, HE WOULD MOST LIKELY NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO IF THE ENGINE COMPLETELY LOST POWER AND COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED!    I HAVE ALSO HAD TO MISS TIME FROM WORK AND HAD TO PAY $54 FOR THE VEHICLE TO BE TOWED.  ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF HYUNDAI HAD BEEN MORE PROACTIVE ABOUT REPLACING THE ENGINES.  NOW THE SERVICE TECHNICIANS ARE TELLING ME THAT THERE ENGINES ARE ON BACKORDER FOR UP TO 9 WEEKS!  THE SAID THAT I MAY QUALIFY FOR A RENTAL, BUT I DOUBT THAT MY TEENAGE SON, WHO DRIVES THE CAR TO SCHOOL, SPORT ACTIVITIES AND WORK WILL BE ABLE TO USE A RENTAL SINCE HE IS UNDER 18.    HYUNDAI HAS KNOWN OF THE NEED TO REPLACE THESE ENGINES AND SHOULD HAVE INCREASED MANUFACTURING REPLACEMENTS AS SOON AS THEY BECAME AWARE OF THE ISSUES.  I AM ALSO WONDERING WHAT GUARANTEES WILL BE IN PLACE WITH THE NEW ENGINE BLOCK.
PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PROBLEM WITH ELECTRIC POWER STEERING MOTOR-TO-SHAFT COUPLING WEARING OUT PREMATURELY.  HAVE RECEIVED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY NOTICE BUT IT HAS ALREADY EXPIRED.  ISSUE NOTICED PRIOR TO 100K MILES.  DEALER SAID $400 BUT NO SAFETY ISSUE.  NOW THEY WILL FIX IT BUT IT IS PAST THE 100K EXTENDED WARRANTY.  THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A NO-COST RECALL.
VEHICLE IN MOTION ON HIGHWAY HEADLIGHTS, INTERIOR DASH LIGHTS START FLICKERING ON AND OFF. HAVE HAD TO REPLACE DRIVER SIDE HEADLIGHT TWICE OWNING THE CAR JUST AT A YEAR. VEHICLE PARKED AT HOME DOORS LOCKED NEIGHBORS COME TO TELL ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT MY LIGHTS ARE ON. LIGHTS DO NOT HAVE THE "AUTO" OPTION. SO THE LIGHTS WERE OFF PRIOR TO LOCKING CAR. THE ONLY LIGHTS LITE AT THE TIME OF NEIGHBORS CONCERN WERE THE YELLOW HAZARD LIGHTS AND TAIL LIGHTS. UNLOCKING AND LOCKING THE CAR SEEMED TO FIX THE ISSUE. BUT THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME HAPPENING. ALSO THE IN CABIN DOME LIGHT FLICKERS ON AND OFF IF LEFT ON THE "DOOR" OPTION. SO IT HAS TO BE LEFT ON "OFF". SEEMS TO BE A MAJOR ELECTRICAL ISSUE GOING ON. AS THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF OTHER PEOPLE COMPLAINING OF THE SAME EXACT ISSUE. MOVING ON TO THE ENGINE ISSUE. VEHICLE IN DRIVE AT A RED LIGHT IDLING THE ENGINE WILL JUST STALL OUT OF NOWHERE VEHICLE SEEMS TO JERK AS IF IT WANTS TO TAKE OFF. I FIND MYSELF APPLYING MORE PRESSURE TO THE BRAKE BECAUSE IT SCARES ME. IT NEVER SHUTS OFF COMPLETELY HOWEVER IT DOES THIS SO RANDOM THAT AND ISSUE CAN NOT BE FOUND.
DRIVING ON FLORIDA TURNPIKE CAR SHUTS DOWN MOTORS BLOWN NO INDICATION THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE RECORDS PROVIDED VEHICLE WAS BEING MAINTAINED WITHIN A YEAR-AND-A-HALF LATER SAME EXACT THING MOTOR BLOWN DRIVING DOWN THE STREET NO INDICATION THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE MOTOR IS BLOWN ONCE AGAIN PUTTING ME AND MY CHILDREN'S LIFE AT RISK
THE STEERING COLUM IS LOSS, IT POPS WHEN IT TUNS AND JERKS
THE STERRING WHEEL IS LOOSE.
ENGINE IS BAD 100,923, ENGINE SIEZED LIKE ALL THE OTHERS
THERE IS A RECALL ON THE ENGINE AND THE MANUFACTURER REFUSES TO HAVE IT FIXED BECAUSE I AM LOCATED OVERSEAS. I AM ACTIVE DUTY ARMY AND CURRENTLY ON MISSION SO MY CAR IS WITH ME. THE CAR WENT DEAD ON THE HIGHWAY AND I ALMOST LOST MY LIFE AND THEY STILL MADE NO EFFORT TO FIX THE PROBLEM.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE DRIVING VARIOUS SPEEDS, THE TIRES WOULD NOT MOVE WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL WAS TURNED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO A DEALER WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE STEERING WHEEL GROMET NEEDED TO BE REPLACED, BUT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 51,000.
I WAS DRIVING AND ALL LIGHTS BEGAN FLASHING ON DASHBOARD, STEERING WHEEL JERKED AND I LOST POWER STEERING, WAS ABLE TO PULL OFF ROAD INTO A PARKING LOT, TURNED THE CAR OFF AND IT WOULD NOT START BACK UP.  *TR
MY ENGINE IS GOING TO FREEZE IT HAS NO POWER AND THE TRANSMISSION IS SLIPPING. IT ONLY HAS 74,000 MILES ON IT. I SPENT ALL OF MY MONEY ON THAT CAR AND IT HAS A SALVAGE TITLE, SO I CANT SELL IT ORTRADE IT IN. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER FOR THE RECALL AND THEY SAID IT DIDNT FALL UNDER THAT RECALL SO I TOOK IT TO A DIFFERENT DEALER THEY SAID THE SAME THING!,  I WANT MY CAR FIXED!!!!! IM A SINGLE MOTHER AND IM HOMELESS AT THE MOMENT SO I REALLY NEED MY CAR!!!!
STEERING WHEEL KNOCK AND VIBRATIONS AT HIGH SPEEDS. STEERING COUPLER FAILURE.
POWER STEERING COUPLER IS FAILING. SERVICE AT DEALERSHIP TOLD ME I WOULD NEED TO HAVE THIS REPLACED. FROM READING THE VAST NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER PEOPLE HAVING THE EXACT SAME ISSUE, IT IS APPARENT THAT THE PART IN QUESTION IS DEFECTIVE. WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO ISSUE A RECALL FOR REPLACEMENT OF THIS PART? HYUNDAI APPEARS TO BE KNOWINGLY PUTTING THE LIVES OF ITS CUSTOMERS IN JEOPARDY BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY TO HAVE THE PROBLEM CORRECTED.  *TR
AIRBAG LIGHT SUDDENLY CAME ON AND WILL NOT GO OFF, STAYS ON CONTINUSLELY. CAR IS UP FOR INSPECTION IN A FEW MONTHS AND WILL NOT PASS A SAFETY INSPECTION.   HAVE RESEARCHED THIS ONLINE AND FOUND OVER 100 COMPLAINTS FOR THIS PROBLEM.  THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE AS IF I AM IN AN ACCIDENT THE AIRBAG WILL NOT DEPLOY.(OR WORSE MAY HAPPEN)
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE PULLING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE, A CLICKING SOUND EMERGED FROM THE STEERING WHEEL. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER TWICE WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE STEERING COUPLER FAILED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 107,000.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE DRIVING AND ATTEMPTING TO MAKE A TURN, AN ABNORMAL CLICKING NOISE EMITTED FROM THE STEERING WHEEL. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER FOR DIAGNOSTIC TESTING; HOWEVER, DETAILS OF THE DIAGNOSIS COULD NOT BE PROVIDED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE VIN WAS NOT INCLUDED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 16V190000 (STEERING). THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 75,000.
AIR BAG LIGHT WON'T GO OFF - SERVICED REGULARLY - BROUGHT THIS TO TWO SEPARATE DEALERS NOT COVERED THEY SAID CLOCK SPRING TIMER AND IT IS NOT ON RECALL LIST - THEY DID SAY IT IS UNSAFE IF AIRBAGS DEPLOY IF YOU SHOULD HIT A BUMP - EXTENDED WARRANTY DOESN'T TOUCH AIRBAGS...
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE DRIVING VARIOUS SPEEDS, THERE WAS A CLUNKING NOISE WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL WAS TURNED RIGHT OR LEFT. WHILE DRIVING 60 MPH OR GREATER, THE STEERING WHEEL AND DASHBOARD SHOOK. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER FOR DIAGNOSTIC TESTING, BUT THE DETAILS COULD NOT BE PROVIDED. THE VEHICLE WAS SERVICED PER NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 16V190000 (STEERING), BUT THE REMEDY FAILED TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE. THE STEERING WHEEL CONTINUED TO SHAKE AFTER THE RECALL REPAIR. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 126,200.
SEEMINGLY OUT OF THE BLUE, THE STEERING WHEEL BEGAN TO HAVE EXTRA GIVE WHEN TURNED EVEN SLIGHTLY.  DAYS LATER, A RATTLING SOUND IN THE COLUMN STARTED, ESPECIALLY WHENEVER I HIT A BUMP IN THE ROAD OR TURNED CORNERS.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD IT WAS A BROKEN COLUMN COUPLER.
HAD NO IDEA THERE WAS THIS MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE STEERING I AS WELL HAD A RATTLE IN THE STEERING WHEN I WENT OVER A BUMP OR TURNED MY WHEELS IT WOULD MAKE A LOUD NOISE, WAS TOLD BY SOMEONE IN MY HOMETOWN THEY HAD AN ELANTRA THAT SOMETHING IN STEERING BROKE AND CAUSED THEM TO BRAKE SO I WAS REALLY PARANOID THEN.  I CALLED THE DEALER TOLD ME EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS AS SOON AS I TOLD HIM HOW IT WAS DOING AND THAT'S A $200 FIX I SAID THIS MUST HAPPEN A LOT REPLY WAS YES IN SONATAS AND ELANTRAS WHY ISN'T THERE A RECALL MY CAR DOESN'T EVEN HAVE 58,000 MILES ON IT AND HAVE NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN IN ANY OTHER VEHICLE I HAVE OWNED.  ONCE DROVE ONE FOR 15 YEARS NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM!!
61,149 MILES AND ABOUT A MONTH AGO I WAS ON THE EXPRESSWAY AND NOTICED THE STEERING WHEEL START SHAKING WHEN I HIT ABOUT 65MPH, DROP TO AROUND 60 AND IT WOULD STOP. I THOUGHT IT WAS THE TIRES, ALIGNMENT OR SOMETHING ELSE BUT THEN I STARTED NOTICING THAT EVEN GOING OVER SMALL BUMPS OR SEWER LIDS THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD SHAKE AND MAKE A KNOCKING NOISE. I TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC WHO SAID THIS WAS A RECALL AND SHOULD BE COVERED, WENT TO DEALER AND THEY SAID ITS NOT COVERED BECAUSE GENERAL WARRANTY JUST EXPIRED, CALLED AND TOLD ME IT WAS THE STEERING COUPLING, IT WAS NOT UNDER RECALL AND IT WOULD BE $427.00! EBAY HAS THE PART FOR $5.45! AFTER RESEARCHING AND READING THESE COMPLAINTS I AM GLAD THAT I AM NOT ALONE, HOWEVER A LOT OF US ARE UNFAIRLY OUT A LOT OF MONEY IF WE HAD TO PAY TO REPLACE THIS RATHER THAN RISK OUR LIVES! WITH THE EPS RECALL AND THE OTHER STEERING GEAR ASSEMBLY RECALL, WHY ISN'T THIS PART OF IT AND WHY ISNT IT COVERED? SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH COMPLAINTS AND OWNERS HAVING THIS ISSUE, AND NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE MADE COMPLAINTS HERE. IT ALSO SEEM THAT THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT AFTER WARRANTY, 60K MILES?? IRONIC? THIS IS MY 2ND SONATA AND I AND THE 2ND TIME THAT RIGHT AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRES, SOMETHING ALL OF A SUDDEN GOES WRONG. I HAVE PERSUADED OTHERS TO PURCHASE SONATA AND ELANTRA AND PLANNED ON PURCHASING ANOTHER SONATA BUT THIS IS REALLY LEAVING A BAD TASTE IN MY MOUTH. A WEEK AFTER MY LAST SONATA WARRANTY EXPIRED I STARTED TO HAVE PROBLEMS, PROBLEMS THAT WERE OF COURSE NO LONGER COVERED UNDER WARRANTY ALTHOUGHT WHEN IT WAS COVERED THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG YET AFTER WARRANTY THEY FOUND THE ISSUE? I ENDED UP SPENDING OVER 2K OUT OF POCKET AND THEN DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE 2011 SONATA. I REALLY HOPE THIS PROBLEM IS INVESTIGATED, CORRECTED AND ADDED TO THE RECALLS!
I HAVE A RECALL ON MY VEHICLE AND HAVE YET TO RECEIVE ANY ASSISTANCE.
IMMEDIATELY AFTER STARTING THE CAR THE TRANSMISSION GEAR INDICATOR LETTERS IN THE DASHBOARD WERE BLANK AND THE SHIFTER GEARS LETTERS WERE NOT ILLUMINATED.  A TEMPORARY REMEDY WAS TO SHUT OFF THE ENGINE AND RESTART THE CAR.  THIS PROBLEM IS ERRATIC AND CANNOT BE REPRODUCED AT WILL.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE DRIVING VARIOUS SPEEDS, THERE WAS AN ABNORMAL KNOCKING NOISE COMING FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.

THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 135,241.
STEERING WHEEL/COLUMN STATED MAKING A CLICKING NOISE ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO. AT FIRST IT WASN'T THAT BAD; NOW EVERYTIME YOU MOVE THE STEERING WHEEL A CLICKING NOISE IS MADE. EVERY BUMP OR RUT YOU HIT IN THE ROAD MAKES IT RATTLE. SOUNDING AS IF IT IS GETTING READY TO BREAK.. I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE HYUNDAI PLACE SEVERAL TIMES AND REPORTED THIS PROBLEM. HYUNDAI KEEPS TELLING ME THAT THIS IS NOT A RECALL.  IT WILL COST ME $250.00 TO $300.00 TO HAVE THIS REPAIRED. MY QUESTION STILL REMAINS THAT IF THIS STEERING COUPLING IS DEFECTED AND IT IS CONTROLLING THE STEERING OF THE CAR THEN WHY IF IS NOT A RECALL? MY STEERING WHEEL VIBRATES, SHAKES, AND MAKES AN AWFUL RACKET. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS NOT CONSIDERED A RECALL.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE DRIVING 15 MPH, THE ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED. THE FAILURE OCCURRED WHENEVER THE VEHICLE WAS OPERATED.

THERE IS AN ISSUES WITH THE STEERING COUPLING ON MY 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA. THIS CAR HAS LESS THAN 50000 MILES AND HAS BEEN MAINTAINED SINCE I'VE OWNED THIS VEHICLE. THE STEERING WHEEL FEELS LIKE IT COULD FALL OF AT ANY MOMENT IT SHAKES VIOLENTLY WHEN STOPPING AND ALSO WHEN GOING OVER 60 MILES AND HOUR. THE SMALLEST BUMPS IN THE ROAD CAUSE A VIOLENT SHAKING AS WELL. THIS PART THE COUPLING IS LITERALLY A PIECE OF RUBBER THE SIZE OF A QUARTER IT COST 15 DOLLARS AT THE PART STORE AND THE DEALERSHIP WANTS 200 DOLLARS TO FIX IT. I KNOW SEVERAL OTHER SONATA OWNERS THAT ARE HAVING THIS SAME ISSUE AND EVERY WEBSITE I'VE FOUND THERE HAVE BEEN MANY MANY OF THE SAME COMPLAINTS. WHEN I CALLED MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP THE MAN I SPOKE TO NEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS WRONG AND HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO FIX. HE ALSO SAID THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE 2011 SONATA.  THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE.  PLEASE ISSUE A RECALL!!!!!
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE DRIVING 30 MPH, THE STEERING WHEEL BECAME DIFFICULT TO TURN. THE CONTACT HAD TO APPLY FORCE TO THE STEERING WHEEL IN ORDER TO STEER THE VEHICLE.

THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE ISSUE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 110,000.
MY STEERING WHEEL HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY LOOSE AND SHAKY OVER THE PAST MONTHS WHEN DRIVING OR STATIONARY. THERE IS A VERY DISTINCT (AND GETTING WORSE OVER TIME) "CLICKING" OR "KNOCKING" SOUND WHEN I BACK UP AND TURN MY WHEEL EITHER WAY. I WAS TOLD BY MY MECHANIC THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH MY STEERING GEAR BOX/SHAFT SECTOR AND POSSIBLY SOME OF MY AXLES. HE TOLD ME THIS WAS DANGEROUS, AND THAT THE RECALL CAMPAIGN NUMBER 097 SHOULD COVER ME. HOWEVER, I WAS TOLD BY HYUNDAI THAT MY SPECIFIC CAR DOES NOT FALL UNDER THIS RECALL, EVEN THOUGH I MY CAR HAS THE EXACT SYMPTOMS OF THE RECALL. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT BECAUSE OF RECENT RECALLS, MY WARRANTY WOULD BE EXTENDED. HOWEVER, HYUNDAI HAS NOW TOLD ME THAT MY WARRANTY EXTENSION ONLY COVERS THE SOLE ENGINE, AND NOT THE AXLES THOUGH THEY ARE PART OF AND COVERED BY THE INITIAL ENGINE WARRANTY. HYUNDAI HAS TOLD ME THERE ARE "KITS" TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS, BUT I HAVE TO PAY OVER $1000 FOR THE KITS TO FIX, EVEN THOUGH THESE WERE FAULTY PARTS BY HYUNDAI. THE HYUNDAI SERVICE MANAGER I SPOKE WITH TOLD ME FLAT OUT THAT MY CAR HAD FAULTY PARTS, BUT THAT THE KITS COULD FIX THEM. I ASKED HIM WHOSE FAULT IT WAS THAT THEY WERE FAULTY, AND HE SAID THAT ALL CAR COMPANIES DEAL WITH THIS AND IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF MY DRIVING. BUT EVEN STILL SO, I HAVE TO BE THE ONE TO PAY FOR HYUNDAI'S FAULTY PARTS AND NON-EXISTENT RECALL HELP. I'M BEYOND FRUSTRATED AFTER READING SO MANY REVIEWS AND FORUMS ONLINE OF PEOPLE WITH THE EXACT SAME CAR SYMPTOMS AS MINE WHO ARE UNFORTUNATELY ALSO NOT COVERED BY THE RECALL. IF I CANNOT GET A BETTER RESPONSE AND ANSWER FROM THIS, I WILL BE CONTACTING THE MAIN LAWYER WHO OTHERS HAVE ALSO CONTACTED ABOUT THIS AND FILING AN OFFICIAL LAWSUIT. I EXPECTED WAY BETTER FROM HYUNDAI AND AM DISGUSTED AND DISAPPOINTED AT THE LACK OF SERVICE, TRUTHFULNESS, AND INTEGRITY FROM THIS COMPANY AT THIS POINT.

ANYTIME I DRIVE OVER 40 MPH THE STEERING WHEEL MAKES A LOUD CLICKING NOISE AND SHAKES HEAVILY. IT'S HARD TO CONTROL THE WHEEL IT FEELS LIKE SOMETHING IS LOOSE IN THE STEERING COLUMN. THE CLICKING SOUNDS AS IF SOMETHING IS VIBRATING SO HARD THAT IT BANGING ON SOMETHING. WHEN I TOOK IT TO MY MECHANIC HE INFORMED ME HE REPLACED A FLEXIBLE COUPLING IN 2 2011 SONATAS WITHIN THE LAST 6 WKS. I LOOKED ONLINE ABOUT THE SPECIFIC ISSUE AND THOUNDSAND OF 2011 SONATA OWNERS WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SAME THING. I CALLED THE HYUNDAI OF FT. MILL DEALERSHIP IN FT MILL SC WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR TO EXPLAIN WHAT I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING. SERVICE REP LARRY V. SAID THAT IS A COMMON PROBLEM AMONGST SOME SONATAS MADE IN 2011 WHICH IS WHY HYUNDAI BUILD THE VEHICLE WITH A METAL COUPLING VS. A RUBBER ONE. HE SAID IT'S A DANGEROUS MATTER BECAUSE THE STEERING WHEEL IS NOT FULLY ATTACHED AND THE CAR COULD LOSE CONTROL WHILE DRIVING AND THE FRAGMENT WEAR DOWN MORE AND MORE AS YOU DRIVE.

THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE MANUFACTURER EXCEEDED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THE RECALL REPAIR. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 62,000.
FOR THE PAST MONTH I HAVE BEEN HEARING A KNOCKING COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD ALSO AS IM ACCELERATING MY CAR SEEMS TO SLIP A GEAR AND LOSE SOME SPEED. I LOOKED UP THESE THINGS ON LINE AND THATS WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT MY CAR WAS RECALLED.  I CALLED HYUNDAI TWICE AND WAS TOLD YES MY CAR IS ON THE RECALL LIST BUT AS OF NOW THEY DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION.  THEN ONE DAY AFTER WORK WHEN I WENT TO START MY CAR IT HESITATED TO START.  THE NEXT MORNING I WENT TO AUTO ZONE TO HAVE MY BATTERY CHECKED AND THE MACHINE SHOWED IT HAD 70% JUICE.  WENT ON TO DO MY SHOPPING CAME OUT TO START MY CAR AND IT WAS COMPLETLY DEAD.  I CALLED HYUNDAI AND THEY TOLD ME TO CALL ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND HAVE IT TOWED TO THEM, WHICH   I DID AND NOW IM JUST WAITING TO FIND OUT WHATS WRONG. THIS CAR IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE!
STEERING COLUMN CLICKS LOUDLY WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL MOVES LEFT OR RIGHT. IT DOES NOT MATTER IF THE VEHICLE IS MOVING OR IN PARK. THE PROBLEM OCCURRED ABOUT 100,000 MILES. THE VEHICLE IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY, AND I HAVE NOTICED THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER CARS OUT THERE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. ALSO, WHEN TRAVELLING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED THE STEERING WHEEL SHAKES VIOLENTLY. NO, IT DOESN'T NEED AN ALIGNMENT.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING AT VARIOUS SPEEDS, AN ABNORMAL NOISE WAS HEARD FROM THE STEERING WHEEL. THE AIR BAG WARNING LIGHT WAS ILLUMINATED. THE FAILURE WAS PERSISTENT. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE STEERING COUPLER WAS FRACTURED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 113,000.
NEAR THE BEGINNING OF 2015 I NOTICED SOME PLAY OR LOOSENESS IN THE STEERING WHEEL WHEN TURNING AT SLOW SPEED SUCH AS PARKING.  AS TIME WENT ON, I FELT/HEARD A "CLUNCKING" SOUND IN THE FIRST INCH OF WHEEL TURN AT SLOW SPEEDS AND PLAY IN THE WHEEL AT CRUISE SPEEDS.  I DID NOT THINK MUCH OF IT UNTIL I CHECKED SAFECAR FOR COMPLAINTS FOR MY MODEL CAR.  WITHIN THE LAST TWO MONTHS THE STEERING HAS GOTTEN MORE "SLOPPY" AND A LOUD THUD OR RATTLE IS HEARD/FELT SOMEWHERE LOWER IN THE STEERING COLUMN WHEN I HIT A RUT IN THE ROAD OR DRIVE ON A BUMPY ROAD, RAILROAD TRACKS, ETC.  EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM IS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED BY OTHER OWNERS AND THE PREVIOUS RECALL FOR MODELS PRIOR TO 2011/2010.  I AM 58 YEARS OLD, AND NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH ANY CAR I OWNED. I AM PARTICULAR CONCERNED THAT HYUNDAI ALREADY HAD A RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM, AND CONTINUED TO USE A DEFECTIVE SYSTEM/PARTS IN LATER MODELS. I AM ALSO CONCERNED THAT THIS OCCURRED WITH ONLY 16000 MILES ON MY CAR.  I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING WITH THIS PROBLEM. IF IT WAS A RECALL BACK IN 2010, IT SHOULD BE A RECALL NOW. I AM DISAPPOINTED THE NHTSA HAS NOT TAKEN ACTION.
EXPERIENCED ISSUE WITH MY HYUNDAI SONATA 2011 NOT STARTING AND HEARD A CLICKING NOISE.   TOWED VEHICLE TO LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP (WHERE PURCHASED).   SERVICE REPORT ON APRIL 21,2015 INDICATED STARTER FORK HAD FAILED.   COST OF LABOR WAS $112.50 AND PLASTIC FORK $8.13.    PLUS TOWING COST  THIS IS NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED FOR ROOT CAUSE AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS.   PER SERVICE DEPARTMENT THIS WAS NOT COVERED UNDER DRIVETRAIN WARRANTY.  THIS PART SHOULD NOT BE FAILING AFTER ONLY 77,213 MILES.      THE LONG TERM RELIABILITY OF THIS VEHICLE IS A CONCERN WITH RISING AND MOUNTING LABOR COST.  HOW LONG WILL THIS FORK LAST?  HOW DID THIS PART PASS THE HYUNDAI DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT VALIDATION AUTOMOTIVE TESTING?  OR IS THIS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT  ISSUE AFTER RELEASE ?  THIS IS ANOTHER KNOWN ISSUE THAT IS BEING REPORTED BY SONATA 2011 OWNERS AND NOT BEING ADDRESSED  IT IS POOR  WHEN THE TOWING SERVICE PERSON KNEW WHAT THE ISSUE WAS. AS HE HAS TOWED SEVERAL SONATAS WITH SAME ISSUE.
ABOUT TWO TO THREE WEEKS STARTED NOTICING A CRACKLING NOISE AS I AM TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL EITHER TO THE LEFT OR TO THE RIGHT  AT LOW SPEED AS THE TIME WENT BY ABOUT TWO WEEKS THE NOISE GRADUALLY INCREASED AND NOW I HAVE ALSO NOTICED A RATTLING NOISE COMING FROM THE STEERING COLUMN AND GETTING TROUGH A BUMP ON THE ROAD .  I  AM WARE OF THE TWO RECALL CAMPAIGNS THAT YOU HAVE LISTED ON YOUR WEBSITE BUT MY CAR VIN # IS NOT LISTED.  CALLED HYUNDAI AND THEY SAID IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO BUT AT THIS TIME I AM FEARFUL FOR MY FAMILY AND ME BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE CAR IS NO LONGER SAFE TO DRIVE.  JUST TO LET YOU KNOW I HAVE MADE A APPOINTMENT FOR TOMORROW  WITH A LOCAL HYUNDAI CAR DEALERSHIP .  THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN AND ATTENTION.   *TR
48 HOURS AFTER THE DEALER REPLACED TWO SELENODES AND WIRING HARNESS (STATING IT COULD BE MY DRIVING HABITS, BUT WOULD FILE IT UNDER THE WARRANTY) - THE VEHICLE STARTING SHIFTING EVEN HARDER THAN IT PREVIOUSLY HAD AND THEN SUDDENLY WOULD NOT GO OVER 25MPH AND THE RPMS WERE 5-6.  LUCKILY WAS ABLE TO GET VEHICLE TO THE DEALER (I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER) - AND WAS TOLD IT NOW NEEDS A NEW TRANSMISSION.  I HAD ZERO ISSUES WITH MY VEHICLE TILL IT HIT APPROXIMATELY 75,000 MILES.  I HAVE FILED TWO OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THIS WEBSITE REGARDING THE OTHER TWO INCIDENTS THAT I'VE HAD WARRANTY WORK DONE ON IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS.  I EXPECT THAT THIS VEHICLE WILL COMPLETELY FALL APART BY THE TIME I HIT 100K AND THERE IS NO LONGER A WARRANTY.  I AM VERY FORTUNATE THAT I DID NOT HAVE MY 3 KIDS WITH ME THIS LAST TIME.
THE STEERING ON MY VECHILE HAS BECOME VERY LOOSELY CAUSING THE STEERING TO NOT STEER PROPERLY.  IF YOU TURN ONE DIRECTION YOUR VECHILE MAY STEER A DIFFERENT WAY. THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL ON THE STEERING ON THIS VECHILE IN THE US.
MY ENGINE SEIZED WHICH SEEMS TO BE A KNOWN PROBLEM. I HAVE MAINTAINED THE VEHICLE VERY WELL. ...UPDATED 07/30/15 *BF    UPDATED 10/20/2017*CN
STEERING WHEEL HAS BEEN MAKING CRACKING NOISES. I TOOK MY CAR TO THE VANDERGRIFF HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THIS WAS HAPPENING TO OTHERS AND IT WAS THE FLEX COUPING IN THE STEERING COLUMN DUE TO MATERIAL FAILURE WHICH COULD RESOLUTE IN LOSS OF STEERING CAPABILITY INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH. I WAS TOLD THE ORIGINAL MATERIAL IN THE STEERING WHEEL IS A THICK PIECE OF PLASTIC AND COULD CRACK EASILY AND HYUNDAI HAD SENT A REPLACEMENT PIECE, WHICH IS MORE FLEXIBLE AND DURABLE, TO THE DEALERSHIPS BUT I WAS FORCED TO PAY NEARLY $500 EVEN THOUGH HYUNDAI IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM. I INQUIRED ABOUT A RECALL LINKED TO THE PROBLEM AND WAS TOLD, THERE IS NO CURRENT RECALL. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING AT 52 MPH, THE VEHICLE STALLED. THE CONTACT WAS UNABLE TO RESTART THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO A DEALER WHO DIAGNOSED THAT THE ENGINE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS  NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 90,000.
THE STEERING WHEEL /COLUMN CLICKS WHEN TURNING. TODAY, MY LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP VERIFIED MY CONCERN AND STATED "NOISE IS COMING FROM INTERMEDIATE STEERING SHAFT $278 MAY NEED STEERING RACK AS WELL $1018.45...".  THERE IS A RECALL ON 2011 SONATAS FOR THIS EXACT ISSUE (RECALL # 10V46000) FOR THOSE BUILT BETWEEN DECEMBER 11, 2009 AND SEPTEMBER 10, 2010. MINE WAS MANUFACTURED ON OCTOBER 22, 2010.... WHICH IS ONLY 6 WEEKS LATER. I AM HAVING THIS RELATIVELY UNCOMMON ISSUE ON A CAR THAT IS < 5 YEARS OLD AND < 62K MILES.  HOW IS IT EVEN POSSIBLE THAT MY CAR HAS HAD TWO STEERING COLUMN ISSUES IN ~ 4 MONTHS? THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE!     I ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT AT 59K,  I HAD MY STEERING COLUMN REPAIRED (REPLACE WORN COUPLER IN STEERING COLUMN).  LUCKILY IT WAS COVERED UNDER THE 60K WARRANTY. THIS NEW ISSUE IS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT ONE, EXCEPT I'M NOW >60K MILES --- OUT OF WARRANTY). AS A MATTER-OF-FACT, MY INITIAL COMPLAINT TODAY WAS THAT THE OLD PROBLEM RESURFACED.     AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE DEALERSHIP 1 YEAR SERVICE WARRANTY, SINCE IT OBVIOUSLY WAS NOT INSPECTED/REPAIRED COMPLETELY. MORE IMPORTANTLY, ON A HIGHER LEVEL, WHY IS THIS EVEN HAPPENING, ESPECIALLY SINCE I AM ONLY OUT OF THE RECALL RANGE BY 6 WEEKS? THE MANUFACTURING DATES AFFECTED BY THIS RECALL SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED INTO FURTHERIFURTHER. I FEEL THESE TWO ISSUES ARE RELATED AND  SHOULD COVER MORE MANUFACTURE DATES.   *TR
WENT TO LAKELAND AUTOMALL WHICH IS A HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP TO GET SOME RECALLS TAKEN CARE OF. UPON ARRIVAL I GAVE THEM SOME RECALL PAPERWORK IN WHICH THEY REFUSED TO LOOK AT AND SAID THAT THEY HAVE IT IN THEIR DATABASE. THE RECALL THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE "STOP LAMP SWITCH MALFUNCTION" WAS NOT COMPLETE. WHEN I GOT MY CAR BACK I CHECKED MY BRAKE LIGHTS AND THEY DID NOT WORK PROPERLY. I TOLD THEM THAT WHEN I DRIVE IN CRUISE CONTROL MY CAR RELEASES IT AND MY BRAKE LIGHTS STAY ILLUMINATED AND MY ESC CONTROL LIGHT COMES ON. ALSO ON OCASSION ONE OF MY TAIL BRAKE LIGHTS WORK BUT NOT THE OTHER. THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY FIXED THIS PROBLEM LAST APRIL OF 2014 BUT APPARANTLY THE SAME PROBLEM IS REPLICATING. THEY THEN TOLD ME IT NEEDED A WHOLE TAILIGHT ASSEMBLY.   *JS
WHEN FIRST PURCHASED IN MARCH OF 2014 NOTICED A LITTLE CLICKING IN STEERING WHEN TURNED LEFT OR RIGHT. NOW ITS GOTTEN WORST!  EVEN WHEN PARKED IT CLICKS. WHEN WE HIT THE SMALLEST BUMP ON THE ROAD IT CLICKS AND SHAKES BAD. I'M TO THE POINT OF SCARED TO DRIVE MY OWN CAR. I'M SCARED I WOULD HAVE NO CONTROL OF THE STEERING ONE DAY. I CAN NOT DRIVE THIS CAR WITH MY 3 KIDS IN IT. I THOUGHT I BOUGHT ME A SAFE FAMILY CAR. I WAS WRONG.  I'M DOING MY RESEARCH RIGHT NOW AND SEE LOT OTHERS HAVE THIS PROBLEM. IT NEEDS TO BE A RECALL. MY HYUNDAI DEALER SAYS IT'S THE COUPLING. HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT PROBLEM I WAS HAVING. LIKE IT ISN'T NEWS TO HIM.  IT'LL GONNA COST ME $349 TO GET THIS FIXED?!?!?   *TR
STEERING WHEEL COUPLER HAS BROKEN.  NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY!   THIS PART IF FAILING ON MANY SONATAS AND SHOULD BE RECALLED.  *TR
CAR STARTED MAKING KNOCKING NOISES WHILE DRIVING UP HILL, LOSING POWER.  PROCEEDED TO DRIVE IT HOME.  CHECKED OIL AND APPEARED COMPLETELY DRY.  NO ENGINE WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON WHEN CAR HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN DRIVEN.  NO OIL LEAKS SEEN.  ADDED OIL AND THEN DROVE TO DEALERSHIP, WHERE THEY STATED ENGINE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  REGULARLY SERVICED CAR WITH OIL CHANGES, 120K MILES WITH ALMOST ALL FREEWAY COMMUTE.  *TR
I HAVE NOTICED A CLICK OR SLIGHT KNOCK COMING FROM THE STEERING WHEN TURNING WHEEL LEFT OR RIGHT AT LOW SPEEDS, ESPECIALLY WHEN PARKING. OVER UNEVEN SURFACES THERE IS SHAKING OR SHUTTER IN THE STEERING COLUMN ALSO. THESE CONDITIONS SEEM TO BE WORSENING. I WILL BE SCHEDULING FOR SERVICE.  *TR
THURSDAY THE 11TH WAS GOING INTO TOWN FOR SOME ITEMS. CAME TO A STOP LIGHT WITH A CAR A HEAD OF ME WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN WE WENT. THE CAR THAT WAS IN FRONT OF ME MADE A RIGHT HAND TURN I WAS GOING ABOUT 30 TO 35 MPH WHEN I WENT TO APPLIED THE BRAKES THE WOULD NOT GOO DOWN FELT LIKE A BRICK WAS UNDER MY FOOT. FRIDAY THE 12TH WAS LEAVING WORK GOT STOPPED BY A RED LIGHT A AGAIN WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN I TOOK OFF I WAS GOING ABOUT 35 MPH WHEN I LOOKED TO MY RIGHT THEIR WAS A CAR COMING OFF THE OFF RAMP AND NOT STOPPING WHEN I APPLIED THE BRAKES AGAIN THEY WOULD NOT GO DOWN FELT THE SAME WAY LIKE THERE WAS A BRICK UNDER MY FOOT. HAD TO SLAM INTO THE CURB TO AVOID BEING HIT ON THE SIDE. TOOK CAR TO THE DEALER SHIP THEY SAY THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WANTS ME TO PAY FOR NEW RIM AND TIRE FOR 320 DOLLARS. I HAVE READ A BUNCH OF THE SAME THINGS HAPPENING TO OTHER PEOPLE AND NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO BEFORE SOME ONE GETS KILLED.    *TR
I WENT TO PLACE THE CAR IN REVERSE AND NOTICED THAT THE GEAR SHIFTER  SAID R BUT THE DASH BOARD HAD  A 0 .  THE VEHICLE WENT INTO DRIVE PLACED ON THE BRAKES PLACED THE VEHICLE IN PARK.  THE DISPLAY ON THE DASH STILL SHOWED 0.  I SHUT OFF THE MOTOR AND RE-STARTED THE MOTOR AND THE DASH INDICATED THAT THE CAR WAS IN PARK.        I THEN WENT ON LINE AND SAW THERE WAS A  RECALL JUST ISSUED FOR THIS.  I  HAVE NOT RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE FROM HYUNDAI.    *TR
PULLING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE, I PUT THE VEHICLE IN REVERSE AND IT FELT LIKE IT WAS IN NEUTRAL AS I STEPPED ON THE GAS THE VEHICLE DID NOT MOVE.  I TRIED PUTTING IT IN DRIVE AND BACK TO REVERSE BUT NOTHING HAPPENED.  I TURNED OFF THE CAR AND RESTARTED.  THE CAR WENT INTO REVERSE THIS TIME BUT WHEN I PUT THE GEAR IN DRIVE THE VEHICLE BANGED INTO GEAR AN JOLTED AHEAD.  THE VEHICLE FELT LIKE IT WASN'T SHIFTING UP TO THE LIGHT ABOUT 1/4 MILE AWAY.  WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN THE VEHICLE FELT LIKE IT WAS IN NEUTRAL AGAIN AND WHILE I WAS AT A COMPLETE STOP I PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND THEN TO DRIVE.  IT BANGED INTO DRIVE AND JOLTED AHEAD AGAIN.   THE SAME SCENARIO HAPPENED AGAIN HAPPENED THE NEXT DAY AS I WAS COMING OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY.  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA EQUIPPED WITH HANKOOK, TIRE LINE: OPTIMO H431, AND TIRE SIZE:  225/45R 18V TIRES. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THERE WAS A BUBBLE ON THE TIRE. THE CONTACT MENTIONED THAT THE FAILURE WAS IDENTICAL TO A PREVIOUS FAILURE WITH THE ORIGINAL TIRE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER WHERE THE TECHNICIAN INFORMED THE CONTACT THAT THE FAILURE WAS A KNOWN ISSUE AND THAT THE TIRE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 43,005.   UPDATED 08/11/14*LJ    THE CONSUMER STATED ALL FOUR TIRES WERE REPLACED AND A NEW HANKOOK.   UPDATED 08/13/2014     *JS
2011 HYUNDAI SONATA LIMITED, INTERIOR DOOR HANDLE CHROME PEELING AND CAUSED MINOR LACERATION TO HAND.  *TR
THE CAR WOULD NOT START AND ALL THE ELECTRICAL COMPONENT LIGHTS CAME ON (EMERGENCY LIGHTS BLINKING, TURN INDICATORS, ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL, BATTERY LIGHT INDICATOR, ETC.).  THE HORN WAS BLARING ALSO AND THE KEY WAS IN MY POCKET.  I THOUGHT I HIT THE EMERGENCY BUTTON BY ACCIDENT SO I PULLED OUT THE KEY AND HIT THE BUTTON OFF.  IT WOULD NOT STOP.  I  TRIED STARTING THE CAR, BUT IT WOULD NOT.  IT WENT OFF FINALLY. SO, I TRIED STARTING THE CAR AND ALL THE STUFF STARTED AGAIN.  SO, I CAME HOME WHILE I COULD.  THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE AND DANGEROUS.  *TR
COMPLAINTANT WALKED OUT OF HOME TO VEHICLE.   UPON APPROACHING VEHICLE, COMPLAINTANT NOTICED THAT THE LEFT REAR BRAKE LIGHT HOUSING (DRIVER'S SIDE) WAS DETACHED, AND STICKING OUT ABOUT 1 INCH FROM THE VEHICLE.   COMPLAINTANT CAREFULLY SLID THE HOUSING BACK INTO ITS CAVITY, WHERE IT STAYED.   COMPLAINTANT THEN DEPARTED.   ABOUT 3 DAYS LATER, COMPLAINTANT NOTICED THAT THE HOUSING WAS AGAIN DETACHED FROM THE VEHICLE, AND AGAIN SLID IT BACK INTO PLACE.   OVER TIME, THE COMPLAINTANT REPEATED RETURNING THE HOUSING INTO THE CAVITY THREE (3) ADDITIONAL TIMES.   WHEN THE COMPLAINTANT WAS CONFRONTED WITH A 5TH EVENT OF THE HOUSING DETACHING FROM THE VEHICLE, COMPLAINTANT SHINED A FLASHLIGHT DOWN INTO THE CAVITY, AND SAW THAT THE HOUSING MOUNTING SOCKETS WERE FRACTURED/SHATTERED, AND NONE OF THE SEVERAL MOUNTING STUDS/BOLTS WERE ATTACHED.   BUT, THE STUDS/BOLTS WERE STILL ATTACHED TO THE VEHICLE SHELL.   THE ONLY THING HOLDING THE HOUSING ASSEMBLY ONTO THE CAR, WERE THE WIRES TO THE BRAKE LIGHT, BACK-UP LIGHT, AND TURN SIGNAL LIGHT.   NO SURFACE SCRATCHES, NOR BODY DAMAGE EXPERIENCED.   AFTER INSPECTING THE DEFECTIVE HOUSING, COMPLAINTANT SURMISED THAT HYUNDAI TAIL LIGHT HOUSING IS MADE OF HARD, BRITTLE PLASTIC, WHICH SHATTERS WHEN OVERLY TIGHTENED AT FACTORY, OR DUE TO THE VIBRATION OF THIS OVERLY HARD RIDING VEHICLE.   ADDITIONALLY, COMPLAINTANT NOTICED WHEN VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED NEW, THAT THE DRIVER'S SIDE TAIL LIGHT WAS NOT FLUSH WITH THE REAR TRUNK GATE, AND WAS EXTENDED OUTWARD ABOUT 1/4 INCH.   THE LIGHT ASSEMBLY ON THE RIGHT/PASSENGER SIDE WAS FLUSH WITH THE TRUNK GATE, AND HAS NOT PRODUCED A SIMILAR ISSUE, YET.   COMPLAINTANT SECURED HOUSING TO THE VEHICLE CAVITY BY USING DUCT TAPE.   COMPLAINTANT SCHEDULED VEHICLE REPAIR WITH HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP FOR TOMORROW.   UPDATE TO FOLLOW.  *TR
WHILE TRAVELING, THE CAR SUDDENLY STOP IN TRAFFIC.  WE HAD TO MOVE TO A SAFE POINT.  CAR EVENTUALLY WAS TOWED TO THE NEAREST DEALER.  THEY PINPOINTED THE PROBLEM AS THE FUEL PUMP.  TOLD US NO GAS IN THE CAR, NOT SO, GAS WAS NEARLY FULL.  CALLED AND TOLD US CAR WAS READY TO BE PICKED UP.  WENT TO DEALER, TOLD TO PUT GAS IN CAR.  NOTICE FUEL GUAGE NOT WORKING AND FULL PANEL WAS BLINKING.  DROVED ABOUT 1/2 MILE TO CLOSEST GAS STATION, GOT GAS, HEADED BACK TO GET RENTAL CAR AT DEALER, CAR SUDDENLY STOPPED AGAIN.  THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR NEARLY A MONTHLY.  FINALLY HAD CAR TOWED TO ANOTHER DEALER, AND BEHOLD, THIS TIME, SAID, IT WAS AN ELETRICAL PROBLEM AND WANTED $2600 TO REPAIR, SAID NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY.  MANUFACTURER GOT INVOLVED AND AGREED TO REPAIR AT THEIR EXPENSES.      TALKED WITH ANOTHER OWNER OF SAME MODEL AND YEAR, SHE TOO IS EXPERIENCING SUDDEN STOPS.  MAJOR SAFETY PROBLEMS, AND IT NEEDS TO BE RECALLED, AND THIS TIME MAKING SURE THAT SOME KIND OF COMPENSATION FOR RENTAL IS INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.
3 TIMES ON JANUARY 22, MY BRAKES SCREAMED AND FAILED, ALMOST CAUSING ME TO CRASH.    SINCE THEN, ONCE IN THE RAIN, AS I APPLIED THE BRAKES, THE ENGINE REVVED VERY NOISILY AND THE BRAKES FAILED, AGAIN NEARLY CAUSING AN ACCIDENT.  NOW, EVERY TIME I TAKE MY FOOT OFF THE GAS PEDAL AND/OR APPLY THE BRAKES, THE ENGINE REVS.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION.  HYUNDAI HAS TOLD ME THIS INCIDENT IS NOT COVERED BY THEM.  *TR
THIS VEHICLE IS EQUIPPED WITH PROXIMITY KEY SYSTEM.  THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT START EVEN WITH THE KEY IN THE VEHICLE,  WE TIRED TO USE BOTH KEYS, THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE EITHER KEY.  LIGHTS ILLUMINATED IN THE DASH, ENGINE LIGHT AND OIL LIGHT (CAR NOT RUNNING) OTHER LIGHTS LIT IN GEAR SHIFTER AND STILL NO CONNECTION.  WE COULD NOT OPEN THE TRUNK THERE IS NO KEY SLOT AND THE KEY FOB TRUNK BUTTON WOULD NOT UNLOCK TRUNK.  CAR WAS TOWED TO THE NEAREST DEALER.  NOTE:  THIS IS THE SECOND TIME OUR VEHICLE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM.  JANUARY 2013 SAME PROBLEM WHERE WE NEEDED A TOW TO THE DEALERSHIP.  SAME PROBLEM 4 MONTHS APART.   *TR
BEGINNING OF OCTOBER 2012 I KEPT HEARING RATTLING, CLANKING NOISE COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD. I TOOK THE CAR TO A HYUNDAI DEALER WHERE I LIVE OCTOBER 26, 2012 . THEY CHECKED OUT THE CAR AND TOLD ME BECAUSE THE ENGINE LIGHT DIDN'T COME ON, THEY COULDN'T FIND A CODE TO FIX THE CAR AND TO BRING THE CAR IN WHEN THE ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON. I KEPT DRIVING THE CAR AND HEARING THE SAME NOISE. I TOOK IT TO MEINEKE TO GET AN OIL CHANGE NOVEMBER 14, 2012. DROVE THE CAR APPROXIMATELY 3 WEEKS AND STILL HEARD THE NOISE. I TOOK IT  TO ANOTHER HYUNDAI DEALER  . THEY SAID THE CAR DIDN'T HAVE ANY OIL AND MEINKE FORGOT TO PUT THE DRAIN PLUG BACK IN, THEREFORE IT MESSED UP THE ENGINE, AND THAT'S WHY I HEARD THE NOISE. I KEPT TELLING THEM, I HEARD THE NOISE BEFORE THE OIL CHANGE. I TOOK IT BACK TO MEINKE AND SHOWED THEM THE PAPER HYUNDAI GAVE ME, THEY GAVE ME MY MONEY BACK AND APOLOGIZED. STILL HEARING THE NOISE, I TOOK IT BACK TO THE FIRST HYUNDAI DEALER AND THEY SAID IT WAS ENGINE PROBLEMS AND I HAD TO PAY THE DIAGNOSTIC FEE BECAUSE MY WARRANTY WAS VOIDED DUE TO MEINEKE. I REFUSED TO PAY THE FEE BECAUSE MY CAR IS UNDER WARRANTY. THEY WOULDN'T GIVE ME MY CAR BACK UNTIL I PAID, WE ARGUED BACK AND FORTH AND I CALLED THE POLICE AND THEY GAVE ME MY CAR BACK, BUT TOLD ME NOT TO COME BACK ON THEIR PROPERTY. I THEN TOOK THE CAR TO  WHERE I PURCHASED IT AND SAME THING. THEY SAID TO TRY A GAS ADDITIVE 3 TIMES, IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, GET AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST IN MY AREA WHERE I LIVE.  I NEED MY CAR FIXED AND NO ONE WILL FIX IT. HYUNDAI BLAMES MEINEKE AND MEINEKE BLAMES HYUNDAI. THEY'RE SAYING BECAUSE OF NO ENGINE LIGHT ON, THEY CAN'T SEE THE PROBLEMS, BUT ONE DEALER SAID IT WAS THE ENGINE ANOTHER SAYING GAS PROBLEMS. BOTTOM LINE, IF THE FIRST HYUNDAI DEALER HAD KEPT MY CAR, I WOULDN'T BE GOING THROUGH THIS. HOW CAN I RESOLVE THIS?  *TR
AT APROX 16,000 MILES THE ORIGINAL KUHMO TIRES BECAME CUPPED ON THE INSIDE OF THE TIRE AND BECAME INCREASINGLY LOUD OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  AT 30,000 MILES THE TIRES HAD TO BE REPLACED DUE TO EXCESSIVE TIRE NOISE.  TIRES STILL HAS ANOTHER 25,000 MILE LIFE ON THEM BUT COULD NO LONGER BE USED.  VEHICLES ALIGNMENT WAS CHECK 4 TIMES, TIRES ROTATED AND BALANCED.  ALIGNMENT SHOWS NEGATIVE 5.1 DEGREES CASTER ON LEFT FRONT, WITH NO WAY TO ADJUST.  HYUNDAI AMERICA WA NOTIFIED AND A CASE WAS OPENED BUT THEY REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING OR TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM.  *TR
AFTER DRIVING DOWN THE INTERSTATE I PULLED UP AT MY HOTEL TO VALET MY CAR.  WHEN I WALKED TO THE BACK OF MY CAR I REALIZED THAT MY DRIVER'S SIDE TAIL LIGHT WAS HANGING BY THE WIRES.  AFTER FURTHER INSPECTION I WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT ALL OF THE PLASTIC MOUNTING TABS WERE BROKEN.  THE DEALERSHIP INDICATED THEY HAD SEEN THIS SAME PROBLEM BEFORE, BUT WOULD NOT REPLACE MINE BECAUSE THE MILEAGE WAS OVER 60K.  THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL ITEM IN MY OPINION CONSIDERING BRAKE LIGHTS/ TAIL LIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO HAVE!   *TR
DRIVING AT 40 MPH AND LOST POWER. CAR CAME TO STOP IN MIDDLE OF ROAD AND "CHECK CHARGING SYSTEM" WARNING LIGHT CAME ON.  TRIED SEVERAL TIMES AND FINALLY RESTARTED. CONTINUED ABOUT A BLOCK THEN IT HAPPENED AGAIN. GOT IT STARTED, DROVE A LITTLE FURTHER AND IT HAPPENED AGAIN. GOT THE CAR HOME AND CALLED HYUNDAI SERVICE TO HAVE CAR TOWED TO DEALER.        *JS
DURING LIGHT TO MODERATE ACCELERATION THE TRANSMISSION WITHOUT WARNING GOES BACK INTO A LOWER GEAR ( 1ST GEAR ). MY FIRST REACTION IS TO LET OFF THE ACCELERATOR DUE TO HIGH RPM. WHEN THIS HAPPENED THE CAR BEHIND ME ALMOST REAR ENDED ME. I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO THE DEALER ONCE ALREADY AND I AM TAKING IT BACK AGAIN. UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM. HAS HAPPENED 4 TIMES SINCE JAN 2012. MY MAIN CONCERN IS SOMETIMES WE HAVE ARE GRANDDAUGHTER WITH US AND AM AFRAID THAT THIS COULD CAUSE A ACCIDENT.  *TR
VEHICHLE PULLS BADLY TO THE LEFT IF STEERING WHEEL IS RELEASED. A CONSTANT PRESSURE TO THE RIGHT MUST BE MAINAINED TO KEEP THE VEHICJE IN IT'S LANE
I PURCHASED A 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA AND IT IS A VERY NICE CAR EXCEPT THAT THERE IS A VERY REAL AND SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THE VISIBILITY PROVIDED BY THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS.  I HAVE NOTICED THAT A NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR CONCERN ABOUT THIS AS WELL BECAUSE IT MAKES THE CAR VERY CHALLENGING TO DRIVE SAFELY AT NIGHT. WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING THE CAR AT NIGHT AND HAVE THE HEADLIGHTS ON LOW BEAM AS YOU LOOK THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD THERE IS A VERY DISTINCT BOUNDARY ABOUT MIDWAY UP THE WINDSHIELD AND EVERYTHING ABOVE THAT BOUNDARY LINE IS COMPLETELY DARK.  IT NOT ONLY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE DISTANCE THAT YOU TYPICALLY SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE IN FRONT OF YOU BUT IT IS ALSO EXTREMELY DISCONCERTING BECAUSE EVEN THE SLIGHTEST BUMP CAUSES THE LINE AND YOUR VISIBILITY TO BE BOUNCING UP AND DOWN.  THE OTHER NIGHT I NEARLY HIT A PERSON WALKING ALONG THE ROAD EVEN THOUGH I WAS ONLY DRIVING 35 MILES PER HOUR BECAUSE I WAS ALMOST ON TOP OF THEM BEFORE THEY WERE VISIBLE IN THE HEADLIGHTS.  I HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR MANY YEARS AND THAT HAS NEVER BEEN AN ISSUE WITH ANY OTHER CAR THAT I HAVE OWNED.  *TR
HYUNDAI SONATA HYBRID. FIRST PROBLEM OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 6400 MILES. I WAS DRIVING BETWEEN 60-65 MPH ON THE FREEWAY. VEHICLE LOST POWER AND ALARM SOUNDED. "CHECK CHARGIN SYSTEM" LIGHT ILLUMINATED AND THE CAR LOST ALL POWER TO DRIVE, GAS ENGINE AND HYBRID ENGINE SHUT-OFF IN MIDDLE OF FREEWAY. WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT OFF FREEWAY. LET CAR COME TO REST AND RESTARTED CAR. EVERYTHING SEEMED NORMAL, DROVE IN PARKING LOT AND WAS CLOSE TO HOME. TAKING TO DEALERSHIP WHO HAS NOT HEARD OF ISSUE.  *TR
ALTHOUGH MY 2011 SONATA LIMITED, IS IN EFFECT AN EXCELLENT VEHICLE, IT IS CAUSING ME A GREAT DEAL DISCOMFORT.  IT IS BEING LET DOWN WITH THE WORST STEERING TRACKING I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. THE CAR CONSTANTLY NEEDS TO BE EASED BACK AND FORTH TO MAKE IT STAY STRAIGHT. OVER A LONG RIDE THIS IS VERY FATIGUING, THE SLIGHTEST LAPSE IN STEERING CONTROL TO MADE AN IN CAR ADJUSTMENT OF THE RADIO FOR EXAMPLE, OR TO ADJUST THE REAR VIEW MIRROR, CAN SEND YOU TOWARDS THE GUARDRAIL. I AM CONSTANTLY HAVING TO MAKE MINOR STEERING CORRECTIONS WHEN DRIVING STRAIGHT, I HAVE NEVER FELT SO INSECURE IN CHARGE OF A VEHICLE IN MY LIFE. FOR ALL THE GREAT SAFETY MEASURES BUILT INTO THIS CAR, FOR A FUNDAMENTAL SUCH AS THE STEERING, WELL. YOU KIND OF EXPECT IT TO WORK.  AS LONG AS THERE IS TENSION ON THE STEERING WHEEL, LIKE IN A CURVE OR A TURN, THE STEERING RESPONDS FAST AND ACCURATE. THE SECOND YOU ARE ON THE STRAIGHT ROAD, THE STEERING WANDERS. I REALLY FEEL UNSAFE,  THE PLEASURE I SHOULD BE HAVING WITH THIS CAR HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH TRYING TO STAY STRAIGHT IN MY LANE. MY WORK INVOLVES ME FLYING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY SO I DRIVE COUNTLESS RENTAL CARS, NONE HAVE ANYWHERE NEAR THE BAD STEERING TRACKING I'M EXPERIENCING.  I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE IT BACK, BUT THE DEALERSHIP DOESN'T THINK THERE IS A PROBLEM, THEIR STATIC TESTS SHOW THE ALIGNMENT SPOT ON, AND I WAS RECOMMENDED TO DRIVE IT FOR A FEW THOUSAND MILES AND I'LL GET USED TO IT.  AND THE DEALER'S TECHNICIAN INFORMED ME THAT THE SONATA ALWAYS FOLLOWS THE CREST OF THE ROAD.  THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. I WAS SO CONCERNED I WENT TO SAFERCAR.GOV TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE WAS HAVING THIS PROBLEM, AND FOUND LITERALLY DOZENS OF PEOPLE WITH THIS SAME COMPLAINT.  *TR
2011 SONATA LIMITED WITH SMART KEY FOB HAS FAILED TO START A MINIMUM OF 7 TIMES IN THE LAST 60 DAYS.IT APPEARS THAT SOMETIMES THE CAR DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE SMART KEY AND THIS DOESN'T CHANGE IF THE SMART KEY IS INSERTED INTO THE CENTER CONSOLE SMART KEY HOLDER. THE BATTERIES HAVE BEEN REPLACED IN THE KEY FOB AND THIS DOES NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. WHEN ATTEMPTING TO START THE CAR THE COMPUTER SIMPLY STATES TO DEPRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL AND PUSH THE START BUTTON, WHICH I'VE BEEN DOING. THE BRAKE PEDAL OFTEN FEELS HARD AS A ROCK ALMOST LIKE IT'S LOCKED.THE NORMAL DIAGNOSTIC LIGHTS AND FUEL GUAGE DOES OPERATE BUT THE CAR DOESN'T START. I'VE WAITED AS LONG AS 1/2 HOUR ATTEMPTING AND RE-ATTEMPTING TO START THE VEHICLE. AFTER IT STARTS, THE CAR MAY WORK PERFECTLY FINE FOR THE NEXT FEW TRIPS UNTIL THE PROBLEM REAPPEARS. THIS IS A WORRISOME OCCURENCE SINCE THERE IS NO WAY TO OVERRIDE THE SMART KEY FOB BY INSERTING AN ACTUAL KEY TO START THE VEHICLE. DRIVERS MAY BECOME STUCK AT ANY TIME.
LEASED 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA ON 6/21/11. ON 6/25 WITH 140 MILES ON THE ODOMETER I NOTICED A STRONG PULL TO THE LEFT AT ABOUT 35 MPH. NEEDED TO ACTIVELY CORRECT STEERING TO KEEP CAR IN A STRAIGHT TRAJECTORY. I IMMEDIATELY CHECKED TIRE PRESSURE LOOKED UNDER THE CAR FOR ANYTHING OBVIOUS BUT FOUND NOTHING. DID NOT DRIVE ON HIGH SPEED ROADWAY UNTIL MANY DAYS LATER AND FOUND THAT AT 65 MPH THE PROBLEM WAS THE SAME.  AFTER JULY 4TH HOLIDAY I TELEPHONED HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT, THEY SAID THEY HAD NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE.I DID NOT GO TO THE DEALERSHIP THRU TODAY 8/15/11. I HAVE HOWEVER SEEN THE NUMEROUS SAME COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE 2011 SONATA. I WANTED TO MAKE MY OWN SELF HEARD  AS TO THIS PROBLEM. IT CONTINUES TODAY AND I AM GOING TO GO TO THE DEALERSHIP BUT EXPECT THE SAME STONEWALLING I HAVE READ ABOUT.  *TR
I HAVE OWNED MY 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA FOR ONE YEAR.  ON JULY 15, 2011, I WENT TO START THE CAR AND I COULD NOT DEPRESS THE BRAKE OR START THE CAR.  THE ACC STUFF WOULD COME ON BUT NO IGNITION TO THE MOTOR.  I TRIED AND TRIED TO START IT AND ENDED UP CALLING THE DEALERSHIP.  I WAS TOLD TO "KICK" THE BRAKE PEDAL "HARD" SEVERAL TIMES; WHICH I DID.  I FINALLY GOT IT STARTED AND DROVE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP.  I WAS TOLD "BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH" REPLACED.  LEFT THE DEALERSHIP AND DROVE TO MY OFFICE AND WHEN I WENT TO TRIED TO START THE CAR TO LEAVE THE CAR WOULD NOT START, BUT THIS TIME I HAD TO CALL ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE FOR THE CAR TO BE TOWED BACK TO DEALERSHIP.  DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THEY REPLACED BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH AGAIN.  NOW THE TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT COMES ON AND MY BRAKE LIGHTS ARE NOT WORKING.  WHEN I DID GET IT TO START THE CAR WOULD NOT GO INTO ANY GEAR; IT JUST WAS LOCKED IN PARK.  WELL, YESTERDAY, JULY 20, 2011 THE CAR HAD TO BE TOWED AGAIN BECAUSE OF ALL THE SAME PROBLEMS.  SO, THE CAR HAS BEEN BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP THREE TIMES WITHIN THE PAST FIVE DAYS; TWO OF WHICH THE CAR WAS TOWED.  I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT MY SAFETY BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE BRAKES HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE AIR BAGS NOT TO MENTION THE UNKNOWN ELECTRICAL ISSUES.  *KB
MY 2011 SONATA HAS FAILED TO START 3 TIMES THIS PAST MONTH. THE BRAKE WILL NOT DEPRESS AND IT APPEARS THAT IT DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THAT I HAVE THE KEY. IT HAS A PUSH BUTTON START AND THE KEY DOES NOT GO IN THE IGNITION. AFTER A FEW HOURS IT STARTS. I HAVE BEEN STRANDED IN THE DARK AND THIS MADE IT A SAFETY ISSUE ON A PERSONAL BASIS.  *TR
MY OCT. 8  2011 HYUNDAI SONATA 2.0T IS A LEFT PULLER. I KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL. MY DEALER WILL NOT ADMIT TO THE PROBLEM AND I AM GETTING TIRED OF DEALING WITH IT. SOME DAY SOMEONE IS GOING TO DIE BECAUSE OF THIS PULLING ISSUE. PLEASE HELP US SOLVE THIS. THANK YOU  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 65 MPH, THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO SHAKE AND VEER TOWARDS THE LEFT. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN AUTHORIZED DEALER WHERE THE VEHICLE WAS REALIGNED YET THE FAILURE PERSISTED. THE CONTACT ALSO STATED THAT ONCE THE VEHICLE CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP, THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD INDEPENDENTLY TURN ALL THE WAY TO THE LEFT AS IF SHE HAD REMOVED HER HANDS FROM THE WHEEL.

2011 HYUNDAI SONATA LEFT PULL ISSUE.      I MUST APPLY A PRESSURE TO KEEP THE CAR GOING STRAIGHT ON A FLAT/STRAIGHT HIGHWAY.    THIS YOUTUBE CLIP IS AN EXCELLENT DESCRIPTION OF WHAT I SEE.   HTTP://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=EDDYZWOGOZU     ALSO I FOUND ANOTHER SITE W/ A SIMILAR LISTING: HTTP://WWW.HYUNDAI-FORUMS.COM/T56918-OFFICIAL-2011-SONATA-LEFT-PULL-POLL.HTM. *TR
I PURCHASED A BRAND NEW 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA TURBO LIMITED WITH 6 MILES ON IT.  AS SOON AS I DROVE IT OFF THE LOT, IT PULLED TO THE LEFT AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  I'VE BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE DEALER 4 TIMES FOR THIS ISSUE.  FIRST THEY REPLACED A FRONT STRUT SO NOW I HAVE MISMATCHED STRUTS, THEN ALIGNED IT SO THAT THE LEFT FRONT WHEEL WAS SET AT A CAMBER OF -0.8 DEGREES WHILE THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL WAS SET AT -0.2 DEGREES.  AFTER ALL THESE BANDAIDS, THE CAR STILL PULLS TO THE LEFT, ALTHOUGH THE DEALERSHIP AND HYUNDAI KEEP TELLING ME THE CAR IS IN SPEC AND DRIVES STRAIGHT.  *TR
I LEASED 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA FEB 11 AND SINCE THE FIRST DAY THE CAR PULLS TO THE LEFT. THEY DID ALIGNMENT AND CHANGED THE STRUT ASSEMBLY BUT AFTER 3 TIMES AT THE SERVICE THE CAR STILL PULLS TO THE LEFT. LAST WEEK THE DEALER TOLD ME THEY ARE GOING TO CALL IN COUPLE DAYS. TODAY I CALLED THEM THEY SAID THEY STILL DIDN'T GET THE CALL FROM HYUNDAI . IN MEAN TIME I'M STILL DRIVING DANGEROUS CAR. PLEASE DON'T WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO BE KILLED BEFORE THEY START THE RECALL. THANK YOU.  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 30 MPH, THE CONTACT REMOVED HIS HANDS FROM THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE VEHICLE DRIFTED ABNORMALLY TO THE LEFT. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER. THE TECHNICIAN STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS PROPERLY ALIGNED AND HE WAS UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE A FAILURE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED CONSTANTLY AND WHEN DRIVING AT VARIOUS SPEEDS. THE MANUFACTURER WAS CONTACTED AND ADVISED THAT THEY COULD NOT OFFER ANY FURTHER ASSISTANCE BECAUSE THE FAILURE COULD NOT BE DIAGNOSED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 264.
TL*THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE PULLED TO THE LEFT WHILE HE DROVE AT ANY SPEED. THE FAILURE OCCURRED INTERMITTENTLY. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN AUTHORIZED DEALER SEVERAL TIMES WHERE THE STEERING COLUMN ASSEMBLY WAS REPLACED AND AN ALIGNMENT PERFORMED THE FAILURE CONTINUED. THE CONTACT CALLED THE MANUFACTURER AND FILED A COMPLAINT. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 108 AND THE CURRENT MILEAGE WAS 500.
WHEN DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEED THE CAR MADE A HUGE THUD, IT AUTOMATICALLY SHIFTED FROM 6TH TO 4TH GEAR AND REMAINED STUCK IN FOURTH GEAR UNTIL YOU TURN OFF THE CAR. TOOK CAR TO DEALER AND ENTIRE TRANSMISSION HAD TO BE REPLACED. *TR
SINCE PURCHASING VEHICLE LAST WEEK IT DRIFTS TO THE LEFT.  DEALER DID ALIGNMENT BUT STILLS PULLS TO THE LEFT.  I HAVE CONTACTED HYUNDAI AND I AM WAITING FOR A RESPONSE. *LN
2011 HYUNDAI SONATA SE PULLS HARD TO THE LEFT AT SPEEDS ABOVE 40 MPH ON ANY ROAD SURFACE.  CAR PULLS IMMEDIATELY LEFT IF PRESSURE IS LET OFF STEERING WHEEL.  CAR WILL CHANGE LANES LEFT IN 2-4 SECONDS AND IS DANGEROUS TO OCCUPANTS AND OTHERS.   DEALER HELPFUL BUT WAS UNABLE TO CORRECT.  STATED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING FURTHER THEY COULD DO AFTER ALIGNMENT TO "SPECS". *TR
I HAVE A 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA. I WAS DRIVING ALONG WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE STEERING WHEEL BEGAN SHAKING AND SHUDDERING VIOLENTLY. MY HANDS COULD NOT STOP OR STEADY THE STEERING WHEEL. I WAS SOMEHOW ABLE TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, SWITCH THE ENGINE OFF, AND REMOVE THE KEY. THE STEERING WHEEL CONTINUED TO VIOLENTLY SHAKE AND SHUDDER FOR FIVE MINUTES FOLLOWING.  THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE WAS FRIGHTENING AND HAS REALLY SHAKEN UP MY CONFIDENCE WITH THE SONATA. THANKS GOODNESS I WAS NOT TRAVELING ON A HIGHWAY AT THE TIME. I STRONGLY URGE OTHER 2011 SONATA OWNERS TO GET THEIR VEHICLES TO THE DEALER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AS HYUNDAI HAS NOW ISSUED A RECALL ON THE STEERING. *TR
WHILE DRIVING MY NEW 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA GLS SEDAN WITH 200 MILES ON THE ODOMETER, THE TRANSMISSION FAILED COMPLETELY WHEN A TRANSMISSION HOSE BLEW OFF RELEASING ALL THE OIL OUT OF THE TRANSMISSION.  ONCE AT THE DEALERSHIP THEY SHOWED ME THAT HOSE CLAMP FOR THE HOSE HAD NEVER BEEN ATTACHED CORRECTLY AT THE FACTORY!  THE CAR IS AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIRS.  IT IS NOT KNOW AT THIS TIME IF THE TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN DAMAGED DUE TO THE LOSS OF OIL.  WE WERE NOT HURT AND DIDN'T LOSE CONTROL OF THE CAR.  THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED ON A FLAT PIECE OF HIGHWAY, SHOULD IT OCCURRED IN HILLY TERRAIN OR PASSING ANOTHER VEHICLE THE RESULTS COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH DIFFERENT SINCE THE CAR BECAME INOPERABLE.  VERY DISAPPOINTING SINCE THE CAR HAD ONLY 200 MILES ON IT! *TR
THE 2011 HYUNDAI SONATA WINDSHIELDS HAVE DISTORTED IMAGES WHEN SEATED IN THE FRONT AND VIEWING DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE VEHICLE AND OUT THE WINDSHIELD.  ALL IMAGES SHOW A "RIPPLE EFFECT" .   THIS HAPPENS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS (LEFT TO RIGHT AND RIGHT TO LEFT)  I CHECKED OTHER NEW VEHICLES IN THE SHOWROOM AND THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME ISSUE.  WHILE IT IS SUTTLE AND MOST MAY NOT NOTICE IT CAN BE A PROBLEM WHEN CHANGING LANES OR TURNING RIGHT.  OBVIOUSLY THE DRIVER SEE A DISTORTED IMAGE WHEN LOOKING ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD TO TURN RIGHT. *TR
With no warning my car left me sit on the side of the road and when started the engine made an awful knocking noise. Hyundai denied to replace the engine despite there being at least 2 engine recalls. When I asked why they said it was due to no maintenance records so I provided them with maintenance records like they requested and then they deny it again and say they aren’t replacing the engine because the problem with my engine had nothing to do with the 2 engine recalls my vehicle IS affected by.
Engine suddenly shut off middle of the road while driving and will not restart. No warning  lights came on prior to the engine failure. My family safety was put at risk since engine shut off middle of the road and I had to push it to the corner lane. Just imagine if I was on the middle lane on a highway when this happened. Alternator, battery was checked by a mechanic...no issue.
I believe this is the same issue as the Hyundai recall #170 (activation of the engine management system's brake pedal override feature). While pressing the accelerator, my car will stop accelerating until I let off the gas pedal and then press it again. This is an intermittent issue and unrelated to any fuel delivery system. I confirmed it was a brake pedal issue because my brake lights would not turn off and I could shift out of Park WITHOUT my foot being on the brake pedal.  I feel like this could be a pretty big issue for properly signally drivers behind me as well as when I’m trying to drive in heavy or speedy traffic, e.g., merging onto or within interstate traffic.
Engine stalled in middle of the road while travelling. It put me in danger of getting into an accident. Tried getting appointment with dealership and nonappointments available for next 30 days. No warnings before the failure.
The contact owns a 2012 Hyundai Sonata. The contact stated that while his daughter was driving at 65 MPH, an abnormal knocking noise began to emit from the vehicle as the check engine light appeared on the instrument panel. The vehicle began to lose power as the contact's daughter coasted the vehicle into a parking lot. Due to the failure, the vehicle was towed to the contact's residence. Upon investigation, the contact discovered NHTSA Campaign Number: 15V568000 (Engine) which was linked to the failure. Neither the dealer nor the manufacturer had been notified of the failure. The vehicle had yet to be repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 195,000.
This vehicle and many other same vehicles around the same year are experiencing HYBRID SYSTEM FAILURE for no reason and when this happens the car shuts down and has almost caused multiple accidents by shutting down immediately and not driving. This vehicle has a brand new motor, transmission and battery.
My car was stolen it is Hyundai sonata 2012 although anti software has been upgraded . It is been 10 days since then my car was not recovered.
Engine completely stopped working while driving down the road. Brought to mechanic and told seized engine.
The VIN number for this car is [XXX]. "Check engine" light was on and the car could not pass the inspection. We took the car to the mechanics and they found out " leak from fuel pump module" (please refer to the mechanics report for details) . Due to the safety concern, we have to fix it right away out of our own pocket.   This particular VIN number is not included in the MHTSA ID: 18V934000.   We are requesting this VIN number to be added in the recall ID 18V934000.   INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6). UPDATE-06/01/2023-  Consumer is checking status of  VOQ.
Our 2012 Hyundai Sonata Limited had some kind of seat belt recall done in 2017. Not sure what as we were not given any documentation. We are having problems engaging the Driver's seat belt that started in the last month of 2022. Hyundai keeps referring us to the local dealer to see if indeed it is part of that recall. The local dealer insists on charging  $160.00 inspection fee, if it's covered Hyundai will be charged. A knowledgeable mechanic should be able to sit in the driver's seat and attempt to buckle the belt and know if it is covered, without charging $160.00. Pease help.
Received a warning message saying pull over safely do not drive this vehicle in the middle of the road as I'm driving all the warning lights on the dash came on . The car jerked Then the car died
Driver’s side seat belt frequently unlatches on own while driving vehicle. This places the driver at risk for significant harm should this occur during a collision. This problem has not been inspected or confirmed by the manufacturer or other professionals. The only warning lamp possibly associated with this is the airbag warning lamp.
I brought my engine in to be checked after the recall for engine failure. Hyundai told me it was fine/not affected. I brought my vehicle in twice after that because while driving, the engine suddenly stopped accelerating in the middle of driving. Both times, I was told that nothing was wrong with my car. They went so far as to accuse me of overfilling my gas tank (which I have never done). I trusted them instead of looking up this issue being part of the recall symptoms. Finally, while in the middle of driving, the engine locked up completely. I had it towed to Hyundai. They finally admitted it was covered under warranty, but I see no evidence of them recording it as a vehicle affected by recall. I am very concerned about this because there are probably thousands of other families at risk right now because of Hyundai's dishonesty and dodging responsibility and not including their VINs in the recall either. If their engines were to lock during a left turn for example, people are at risk of dying. In addition, Hyundai has still not reimbursed me for the towing and rental car costs of $2918.27 total which they are entitled to per the settlement. It has been over 3 months since I turned in the last of the paperwork. It has been over 7 months since the engine died. More importantly, they need to be fully investigated for withholding information, falsifying information,  and putting people at risk of death and at a financial disadvantage.
The contact owns a 2012 Hyundai Sonata. The contact stated that the airbag warning light illuminated on the instrument panel upon the start of the vehicle. The contact called the local dealer and an appointment was scheduled to diagnose the vehicle. The manufacturer had yet to be notified of the failure. The vehicle had yet to be repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 41,000.
I was driving inner city about 40 mph on 3/16/22. Vehicle lost power while driving. There were no warning signs, no check engine light, nothing. It just died while driving. I was nearly hit in the back by another vehicle with my 2 small grandchildren in the back seat. I was stuck in middle of road with 2 grandchildren at night in the dark around 8pm in the rain. The roads are slippery and wet during rain. Many cars passing had to jump over without warning because my car was just sitting in the middle of road. It was not safe for me and my grandchildren to get out of the car as it was heavily raining. I got out and stood on side the car until a passer by in a car pulled over to help me push the car out of the middle of the street until the tow truck arrived. Tow truck finally arrived 2 hours later. This car always stalls with no warning and did not crank. It had to be towed to nearby repair shop. My grandchildren and I had to find a ride back home.
After an oil change, my car started losing power at the gas and suddenly turned off on me while I was driving and never turned back on! When I tried turning my car back on my engine started smoking
Smoke started coming from the engine and then caught fire
After driving one day, I noticed the brake lights on without anybody in the car, they would not turn off whatever I tried. The next symptom was the traction control turned off and would not function via dashboard button. the next symptom was, while driving, cruise control turned on without myself doing so, set it's speed and maintained, I was approaching a 4 way stop and depressed the brake expecting cruise control to disengage, it did not, I pressed the brake again this time holding it down while the car continued to revv, the engine continuing to attempt to speed up while pressing the brake. The only thing stopping the car was the on and off button on the steering wheel. I finally came to a screeching halt half way into the intersection, the brakes were locked up and vehicle would not move, the dealership claims no responsibility in anything and blames it in fact on myself putting the wrong brake fluid into the vehicle. I had not put anything into the vehicle, the dealership was the last to touch it when they did a complete engine replacement in Jan 2021. Vehicle is currently in their possession and available for inspection. No warning lights came on and vehicle began to function normally after, and I have not driven it since. I do not feel safe any longer in the vehicle. Dealership wants me to pay for all new brakes, rotors, brake light switch and brake flush, all which I feel is dancing around the real issue of the brakes and the cruise control. This is a real serious safety issue to anyone with this same vehicle and the potential for a serious possibly fatal accident, dealership doesn't seem to think it's a serious issue, and instructed me to drive the vehicle home, I did not!!!!!
This safety issue affects Hyundai Sonatas with a turbo. The vehicle loses acceleration. The engine will rev with the tachometer functioning properly, but the vehicle speed does not increase accordingly. This is a safety issue because drivers could cause accidents when merging into traffic, changing lanes, or clearing an intersection.  This issue may be related to my engine being replaced by Hyundai as part of a recall since it happened within a week of receiving the new engine.  What component or system failed or malfunctioned, and is it available for inspection upon request? -- The problem is related to the wastegate actuator and/or sensor. The ECU/ECM seems to disable the turbo in the vehicle. Stopping and restarting the vehicle (rebooting) eliminates the problem until the vehicle is parked/off for at least nine (9) hours.  How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk? - See introduction above. When accelerating from a stop, the vehicle's acceleration stalls at about 20-23 MPH, even with the tachometer reaching 7,000 RPMs. While driving above 30 MPH, the vehicle is very slow to accelerate so merging onto any highways or changing lanes is a high-risk maneuver.  Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? -- Yes. They first tried to replace the turbo boost sensor but that did not eliminate the problem. Hyundai Sonata owners have reported this problem since 2012. "Wastegate actuator sensor".  Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others? -- Yes, the vehicle has been inspected by a manufacturer dealer service center.  Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear? -- No. The warning lamp does not activate on a regular basis with this issue. The warning lamp does appear approximately 10% of the time but again, rebooting the vehicle removes the warning lamp.
I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK WHEN I HEARD AN EXTREMELY LOUD BOOM, IT SOUNDED LIKE A BOMB WENT OFF IN MY CAR. THEN I WAS SHOWERED WITH GLASS FROM ABOVE. I IMMEDIATELY SLAMMED ON MY BREAKS (FORTUNATELY I WAS ON A COUNTRY ROAD WITH NO ONE BEHIND ME). THE FRONT SEAT PORTION OF MY PANORAMIC SUNROOF HAD EXPLODED. I PULLED OVER AND GOT OUT, LOOKING FOR A BULLET AS I THOUGHT SOMEONE HAD SHOT AT ME THEN FOR A ROCK OR ANYTHING THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY MY SUNROOF JUST EXPLODED GLASS ALL OVER ME. I FOUND NOTHING. I DROVE HOME CRYING AND SHAKING. MY BF TOLD ME TO GOOGLE WHAT JUST HAPPENED TO SEE IF THIS HAS HAPPENED TO OTHER PEOPLE. APPARENTLY IT HAS! I AM UNSURE WHY I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED OF THE CLASS-ACTION LAW SUIT, AS I BOUGHT MY CAR FROM A DEALER AND HAVE HAD IT FOR JUST OVER 6 YEARS NOW.  FORTUNATELY IT IS COVERED UPTO 120,000 MILES DUE TO THE LAW SUIT, I HAVE 118,580 MILES ON MY VEHICLE. I AM STILL EXTREMELY SHAKEN TODAY!! I REALLY WANT TO SELL MY CAR BUT CANNOT AFFORD ANOTHER CAR PAYMENT (THIS MONTH IS MY LAST PAYMENT). VERY UPSET!
BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH PLUNGER DOES NOT RETRACT AS IT SHOULD WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL IS NOT BEING PRESSED, CAR LOOSES ACCELERATION AND LOOSES POWER. WHEN DRIVING ON CRUISE CONTROL, BREAK WILL DEPRESS AND TURN CRUISE OFF AND ON IN DASH.
DRIVING HOME ON NOVEMBER 24TH 2018 I WAS ON A GRAM TO MARKET ROAD AND A DEER JUMPED IN FRONT OF THE CAR. WHEN I WENT TO BRAKE AND THE CAR MADE A HIGH SCREETCH AND DIDN'T STOP. WHEN I HIT THE DEER NEITHER AIRBAG DEPLOYED. IT HAD JUST BEEN RETURNED TO ME FROM THE PREVIOUS ENGINE RECALL
CLUNKING IN STEERING WHEEL WHEN ROCKING LEFT AND RIGHT. PLASTIC  STEERING WHEEL COUPLER WORN. YOU NEED A RECALL ON THIS!

OIL IS NOT SUFFICIENT. I'M LOSING OIL FAST AND THERE IS NOT AN OIL LEAK. I'M HEARING A RATTLE NOISE.MY RADIO CHANGES MEDIA MODES ON ITS OWN.
THE BRAKE PEDAL DOSNT RETRACT AND THE BRAKE LIGHTS DON'T WORK AND THIS CONDITION DRAINS THE BATTERY AT NIGHT WHILE IT'S PARKED.  *TR
ABOUT 2+ MONTHS AGO, I HAD MY CAR SERVICED FOR BRAKES, OIL CHANGE, AND FILTERS.  WITHIN A DAY OR TWO I NOTICED A CRACK ON MY DASHBOARD NEAR THE AIRBAG PASSENGER UNIT.  THINKING IT WAS FLORIDA HEAT RELATED, I PAID IT NO ATTENTION.  DURING THIS COVID PANDEMIC I NOW SEE THAT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PASSENGER AIRBAG NOTATION ON THE DASHBOARD IS CRACKED AS WELL, AND THE LAST TIME MY HUSBAND AND I RAN AN ERRAND, THE AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT WENT ON.  NOW I'M AFRAID TO USE THE CAR TO ANY EXTENT EXCEPT AROUND TOWN FOR SHORT ERRANDS AND WAS WONDERING WHAT I SHOULD DO.  THE RECALL NUMBER 174 SHOWS NO OPEN RECALLS ON THIS ISSUE...HOWEVER....ALL RECEIPTS I HAVE SINCE I'VE OWNED THIS VEHICLE DO NOT SHOW IT HAVING BEEN REPAIRED.  I SEE THAT THE INITIAL REPORT OF THE RECALL (NOT REMEDY) WAS INCORPORATED INTO THE SEAT BELT ISSUE, HOWEVER, THE REMEDY NOTICE IS THE ONE I HAVE NO RECORD OF HAVING BEEN REPAIRED.  THE DEALER HAS RECOMMENDED OTHER WORK BE DONE ON THE VEHICLE EACH TIME I'VE BROUGHT IT IN FOR A RECALL ITEM (??)!  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS AN 2012 HYUNDAI SONATA. THE CONTACT STATED WHILE DRIVING 55 MPH THE VEHICLE SHUDDERED AND STALLED.

THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 65,000.
UPON STARTING THE VEHICLE I RECEIVED A LOUD CHIME AND A WARNING ON THE SMALL SCREEN ON THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER INDICATING A BRAKE FAILURE, AND THAT I SHOULD NOT DRIVE THE CAR.  THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS A VERY LOUD GRINDING AND CHATTERING SOUND COMING FROM THE FRONT OF THE CAR.  THERE WAS ALMOST NO BRAKING ACTION.  I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND ATTEMPTED TO RESTART IT.  THE SAME SYMPTOMS OCCURRED.  I THEN CHECKED OUTSIDE OF THE CAR FOR LEAKING FLUID.  THERE WAS NONE.  I OPENED THE HOOD AND INSPECTED THE BRAKE FLUID RESERVOIR AND FOUND IT APPROXIMATELY 3/4 FULL OF BRAKE FLUID.  I WIGGLED THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS TO THE MASTER CYLINDER AND THE FLUID CONNECTIONS ALSO.  I GOT BACK IN THE CAR AND ATTEMPTED A RESTART.  THE CAR STARTED WITHOUT A PROBLEM.
AIRBAG LIGHT DOES NOT GO AWAY. NO ACCIDENT.  HEADLIGHT AND BRAKELIGHT BURNS OUT EVERY 6-8 MONTHS.
MY STEERING WHEEL STICKS IN ONE POSITION WHILE DRIVING. I HAVE ASKED THE DEALER I TAKE MY CAR TO ABOUT IT AND AT FIRST THEY SAID THERE WAS NO ISSUE. I MENTIONED IT AGAIN AND THE LEAD SERVICE TECH EXPLAINED THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE. THATS ALL FINE EXCEPT IF YOU ARE AWARE OF THE ISSUE THEN I AM BY NO MEANS THE FIRST PERSON TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. I AM WORRIED THAT ONE DAY IT WILL FINALLY LOCK UP COMPLETELY. I NOTICE THE ISSUE ON THE HIGHWAY THE MOST AS THERE ARE NOT AS MANY TURNS BUT YOU CAN ALSO NOTICE IT A LOT WHEN ON STRAIGHT BACK ROADS/COUNTY ROADS. IT HAS BEEN SINCE I HAVE OWNED THE VEHICLE THAT I HAVE NOTICED THIS ISSUE, SO AROUND 15,000 OR SO MILES NOW.
STEERING WHERE MAKES LOUD CLICKING NOISE WHEN TURNED LEFT AND RIGHT.  ALSO, WHEN GOING OVER BUMPS, SOUNDS LIKE THE ENTIRE UNDERNEATH IS ABOUT TO FALL OUT.  MY MECHANIC SAYS IT IS THE COUPLER AND HE BELIEVES THERE IS A RECALL ON IT.  HOWEVER, WHEN I LOOK IT UP, SAYS THAT THE 2011 AND 2013 WERE RECALLED, BUT NOT THE 2012. THE WARRANTY WAS EXTENDED ON THIS YEAR'S MODEL.  ALSO, THE DEALERSHIP IS SAYING THAT IT IS SAFE TO DRIVE.  I DO NOT FEEL SAFE WHEN DRIVING IT; I WOULD LIKE TO GET IT REPAIRED, BUT DO NOT FEEL THAT I SHOULD BE PAYING FOR SOMETHING THAT HYUNDAI KNOWS IS A DEFECT.

AFTER DRIVING FOR A FEW MINUTES ON HIGHWAY, MY 2012 SONATA HYBRID WILL START TO JUMP AND BUCK. IT SLOWLY LOSES POWER AND WHEN IT REACHES LOWER SPEEDS (UNDER 40 MPH) AS I TRY TO ACCELERATE IT WILL FEEL LIKE IT'S TRYING TO CATCH THE NEXT GEAR BUT WON'T. I WILL CONTINUE TO LOSE POWER SO I HAVE TO TRY TO LEAVE HIGHWAY OR PULL OVER, WHICH CAN BE DANGEROUS ON A HIGH SPEED ROAD. IT HAS HAPPENED THREE TIMES SINCE AUGUST 2018. JUST TOOK BACK TO DEALERSHIP BUT FIRST TWO TIMES THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE PROBLEM WHILE TEST DRIVING IT AND ALL DIAGNOSIS INDICATED THE CAR IS FINE. I SEE IN SOME WEB SITES THAT OTHER USERS NATION-WIDE HAVE HAD THE VERY SAME PROBLEM BUT WITH NO RESOLUTION AT HAND.

TEKATA RECALL STEERING WHEEL SHAKES BAD SOUNDS LOSE REALLY STARTED AFTER MY WARRANTY WAS UP ABD THAT'S ONLY 5 DAYS SO I PAY ALL THIS MONEY CARZY  AIRBAG LIGHT CAME ON AND NEVER WENT OFF ALL LIGHT BULBS ON THE CAR LIKE FRONT LIGHTS ALWAYS GO OUT I HAVE TO CHANGE THEM SO MANY TIMES AND BACK LIGHTS EVEN GOT TICKETS THIS COST ME THIS HAPPEN WHY DRIVING THE CAR
WHENEVER I TURN THE STEERING WHEEL A LOUD CLUCK SOUND HAPPENS. IT FEELS LIKE THE STEERING WHEEL IS LOOSE. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH FOUND OUT THAT THE FLEXIBLE COUPLER IS THE PROBLEM. A CHEAP PLASTIC PIECE THAT BREAKS BECAUSE IT IS SANDWICHED BETWEEN 2 METAL GEARS, NOT A GOOD SOLUTION.

BOTH HEADLIGHTS ON MY HYUNDAI WENT OUT AT THE SAME TIME. I WAS TOLD IT WOULD COST $1200 TO REPLACE BOTH.IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE IF I WAS ON THE ROAD AND THEY WENT OUT. THIS IS QUITE EXPENSIVE. IT SEEMS TO ME  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. WAS THERE A RECALL ON THIS PROBLEM? I NOTICED IT AS MY WIFE WAS PULLING OUT OF THE GARAGE.I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THEY WERE NOT WORKING.
WHEN I'M DRIVING WHELL KIND OF COME OFF WHEN I TURN IT'S CLICK AT THE WHELL.. SOME REASON AIRBAG LIGHT ON.. EVERY MONTH I CHANGE MY HEAD LIGHTS OR BRAKE LIGHT IT'S TURN OFF ALWAYS I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT I THINK IT'S ELECTRICAL PROBLEM
DRIVING IN HEAVY HIGHWAY TRAFFIC IN THE HIGH SPEED LANE OF A SIX LANE HIGHWAY MY ENGINE DIED. NO WARNING OF ANY SORT PRECEDED THE FAILURE. I WAS FORTUNATE TO SAFELY NAVIGATE ACROSS THE OTHER TRAVEL LANES IN A VEHICLE WITH NO POWER..
I WAS NOT INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT, BUT THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THAT MY ENGINE HAS FAILED, THE FIRST WAS FEBRUARY 2016, THE DEALERSHIP HAD MY CAR FOR MORE THAN THREE MONTHS. NOW A PART INSIDE OF THE ENGINE THAT WAS REPLACED HAS FAILED. THE CAR IS OVER HEATING. HYUNADI WOULD NOT PAID FOR A RENTAL CAR THE DEALER GAVE ME ONE. THIRD, HYUNDAI WANTED THE DEALER TO SEND PICTURES OF THE ENGINE, THEN SEND PICTURES OF THE OIL MIXING WITH THE ANIT FREEZE LIQUID. I CALLED HYUNDAI AND SPOKE TO MR. CHRIS LOWE AT THE EASTERN REGIONAL HYUNDAI OFFICE HE ASSURE ME THAT HE WOULD CALL THE DEALERSHIP ON WEDNESDAY OF LAST WEEK HE DID NOT AND I HAD TO CALL HIM ABOUT MY CAR. HE WAS NOT HELPFUL. I OWE A GREAT DEAL ON THIS CAR AND I CAN NOT AFFORD TO PAY 800.00 A MONTH FOR A NEED CAR WHICH I DID NOT WANT. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A USED 2017 WITH MILEAGE UNDER 12, 000. NO ACCIDENTS.  I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE RESPONSE AND POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT I HAVE RECEIVED FROM HYUNDAI.  THE ENGINE WAS PROVIDED BY HYUNDAI AND THEY SHOULD HELP ME WITH THE CAR OR BUY IT BACK AND SO I CAN GET INTO A DIFFERENT CAR WITHOUT THE ENGINE PROBLEMS.
LEFT REAR LIGHTING ASSEMBLY MELTED DUE TO REAR LIGHT BULB POSSIBLY SHORTING OUT OR OVER HEATING. IT CAUSED ENOUGH HEAT FOR THE BULB TO BECOME LODGED AND STUCK INTO THE ASSEMBLY DUE TO THE BULB ASSEMBLY MELTING AROUND IT. THIS IS A POTENTIAL FIRE HAZARD THAT COULD IGNITE THE PLASTIC CAUSING A FIRE IN THE TRUNK. WE ARE ASSUMING THAT THE CAR WAS RUNNING.  THE BULB THAT BURNT OUT WAS BLACKEN DUE TO THE HEAT.
TAKATA RECALL???  2012 HYUNDAI SONATA AIR BAGS NOT WORKING. THE AIR BAG LIGHT IN MY 2012 SONATA (BOUGHT BRAND NEW) STAYS ON. MY CONCERN INITIALLY WAS THAT THE BAGS WOULD DEPLOY SPONTANEOUSLY BUT WHEN TAKEN INTO DEALER, I WAS TOLD "THEY WOULD NOT DEPLOY AT ALL - EVEN IF THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT." THIS SEEMS TO BE A MANUFACTURE'S DEFECT. COULD THIS BE UNDER THE TAKATA RECAL? .
I'M HEARING CLICKING IN STEERING WHEELS ,  IT FEELS AS THOUGH THE STEERING WILL FALL OFF. I WAS TOLD I NEED  STEERING COUPLER REPLACEMENT
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE DRIVING VARIOUS SPEEDS, THERE WAS A KNOCKING NOISE COMING FROM THE ENGINE. THE FAILURE RECURRED NUMEROUS TIMES.

THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 90,000.
I HAVE TRIED THREE DIFFERENT TIMES TO GET MY RECALL SERVICED AT HOOMAN HYUNDAI IN INGLEWOOD, CA AND THEY HAVE REFUSED TO WORK ON MY CAR. I KEEP GETTING EXCUSES. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ALMOST A YEAR. THERE IS A RECALL FOR THEM TO CHECK MY ENGINE BECAUSE IT CAN STALL.
THE STEERING ON MY HYUNDAI SONATA APPEARS TO HAVE A MIND OF IT'S OWN AND HAS A VERY WEIRD PULL. ON PERFECTLY FLAT ROADS, IT MOVES TO THE RIGHT AND OR LEFT WHEN LEFT ALONE. MY HYUNDAI ELANTRA DOES NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM. THIS IMPLIES THAT DRIVING REQUIRES CONSTANT STEERING ASSISTANCE CAUSING A DISTRACTION TO DRIVING.    I ACTUALLY NOTICED THIS ISSUE ONLY AFTER MOVING TO ANOTHER CITY. I USED TO LIVE ON THE HILLS AND I ASSUMED THIS WAS DUE TO THE TERRAIN. BUT NOW IT IT DEFINITELY AN ISSUE.    ON AN ANOTHER NOTE, THE STEERING BEHAVES PERFECTLY AT LOWER SPEEDS. IT IS ONLY AFTER YOU CROSS 40MPH THAT THIS ISSUE CROPS UP. I HAVE BSERVED IT FOR OVER A MONTH AND I HAVE HAD MY WHEELS BALANCED, TIRES ROTATED AND INSPECTED AT A DEALER.
BOYFRIEND'S VEHICLE. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND THE CODE P0087 WAS NOTED BY THE OBDII (FUEL RAIL PRESSURE LOW) MECHANIC ORIGINALLY STATED THAT THIS WAS AN "INTERMITTENT" PROBLEM AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED AT + $1200. THIS DIDN'T MAKE SENSE TO HIM SO HE ASKED TO BE SHOWN EXACTLY WHERE THE PROBLEM WAS LOCATED, AND WHAT PART WAS CAUSING THE PROBLEM. THE MECHANIC COULD NOT GIVE HIM AN ANSWER. "IT'S AROUND THIS AREA" HE REPLIED AS HE WAVED ACROSS THE CENTER OF CAR. HE WENT TO ANOTHER MECHANIC AND ANOTHER AFTER THAT.  ONLY CONSISTENCY HAS BEEN THE LACK OF KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. IN THE MEANTIME, HIS OIL IS THICKENING AND DARKENING, AND HIS FUEL IS NOT GIVING HIM THE MILEAGE IT SHOULD. IT SEEMS THE ONLY ASSISTANCE ANYONE WANTS TO GIVE REVOLVES AROUND REPLACING THE WHOLE SYSTEM, YET THE SERVICEMEN THEMSELVES ADMIT THAT THEY ARE UNCERTAIN THAT THIS AVENUE FOR REPAIR IS NECESSARY. NONE OF THEM CAN OFFER US A REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF THE SENSOR ITSELF. FINALLY, ONE MECHANIC ADVISED US THAT UNDER THE P0087 ERROR CODE THE FOLLOWING COULD BE CAUSING THE ENGINE LIGHT TO COME ON: 1. WEAK FUEL PUMP, CLOGGED FILTER OR SCREEN, RESTRICTED FUEL SUPPLY LINE 2.FAULTY FUEL PUMP DRIVER MODULE 3.FAULTY FUEL PRESSURE SENSOR. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS MECHANIC IS A STUDENT AND NOT CERTIFIED TO PERFORM REPAIRS. I VERIFIED HIS OPINION THRU OBDCODES.COM  BUT WAS QUICKLY DISILLUSIONED BECAUSE AGAIN, NO ONE IS WILLING TO CHECK THESE CAUSES INDIVIDUALLY. FINALLY MY BOYFRIEND WAS TOLD TO JUST BUY A CAN OF AIR SPRAY TO BLOW OUT ANY SURROUNDING DUST AND THEN JUST LET HIM 'RESET' THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND SEE HOW LONG IT STAYS OFF. I KNOW THAT THIS IS WRONG AND HAVE FOUND A REPAIR GUIDE FINALLY. BUT,I ALSO NOW FIND SERVICE BULLETIN NO.: TSB-15-01-010 COMPONENT(S):  ENGINE NHTSA ID NUMBER: 10058132 THAT SEEMS TO BE ABOUT THIS ISSUE. HOW DO WE RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM ALREADY?

WHEN DRIVING IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST, I WENT OVER A BUMP AND THE STEERING WHEEL STARTED TO RATTLE (MAKE A RATTLING SOUND) AND SHAKING.  I NOTICED FROM THEN ON THAT THE SOUND AND SHAKE WOULD START WHENEVER I WENT OVER A BUMP AND/OR DROVE BETWEEN SPEEDS OF 60-70MPH.  I TOOK MY VEHICLE INTO MY LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALER AND AS SOON AS I STARTED DESCRIBING THE INCIDENT TO THE TECHNICIAN, HE IMMEDIATELY IDENTIFIED IT AS A PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING COUPLING AND TOLD ME THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE 2011 AND SOME OF THE 2012 SONATAS.  I CALLED HYUNDAI CUSTOMER SERVICE AND EXPLAINED TO THEM WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND ASKED IF THERE ARE ANY RECALLS (THERE ARE NONE).  THEY ALSO TOLD ME TO SCHEDULE AN APPT WITH THE DEALER TO HAVE THE ISSUE INSPECTED IN ORDER TO SEE IF IT WAS COVERED BY WARRANTY.  AFTER MY SECOND APPT. WITH THE DEALER - IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE STEEING COUPLING AND OF COURSE, THAT PART IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY .   CONSIDERING THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE, WHICH AFFECTS THOUSANDS OF HYUNDAI OWNERS, A RECALL NEEDS TO BE INITIATED.

ON OR ABOUT OCTOBER 1, 2103, THE EMERGENCY BRAKE LIGHT ON THE DASH CAME ON AS I STARTED THE CAR AND BACKED OUT OF THE GARAGE. I CHECKED AND RECHECKED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE TO MAKE SURE IT WAS OFF AND THE PEDAL WAS NOT DEPRESSED. EVERY OTHER TIME OR SO, WHEN WE USED THE CAR, THE EMERGENCY BRAKE LIGHT WOULD COME ON AND WE ALWAYS DOUBLE CHECKED TO ENSURE THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS OFF. ON OCTOBER 7, 2103, WE WENT TO THE JENKINS HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP AND AFTER THEY CHECKED THE VEHICLE, THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE BRAKES OR THE COMPUTER. AS WE LEFT THE PLACE, THE BRAKE LIGHT CAME ON FOR THE 20 MILE TRIP HOME. THE HYUNDAI WARRANTY STATES THAT WE SHOULD NOT DRIVE THE VEHICLE BECAUSE THE BRAKES COULD LOCK UP AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. IT IS EITHER A BRAKE PROBLEM OR A COMPUTER AND I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE IT FIXED BEFORE IT CAUSES AN ACCIDENT.   *TR

The contact owns a 2013 Hyundai Sonata. The contact stated that the check engine warning light was illuminated. While driving approximately 55-60 MPH, the vehicle lost motive power, and the vehicle decelerated. The vehicle regained power, and the contact was able to continue driving at slower speeds. While driving at various speeds, the vehicle stalled and went into LIMP Mode before regaining power approximately 3 to 4 times. The vehicle was taken to the dealer who confirmed that the VIN was not under recall. The contact had spoken with another dealer, Sheehy Hyundai of Waldorf (2910 Robert S. Crain Hwy, Waldorf, MD 20601) and it was confirmed that the VIN was not under recall. The vehicle had not been diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was informed of the failure and opened a case. The manufacturer related the failure to NHTSA Campaign Number: 17V226000 (Engine and Engine Cooling); and referred the contact to the dealer. The failure mileage was 126,000.
Car was purchased on [XXX] for our daughter for a little over $6500.00 for a 2013 Hyundai Sonata Limited addition. On around July the 2nd the car started running weirdly and by [XXX] it had stopped running all together and the men from work had to help her push it onto her jobsite, which she wasn't far from.  I had the car towed from her job to a mechanic who stated the engine was frozen. I immediately started googling the year make and model to see how much a used engine would cost. That's when a page came up stating there was a recall on that make and model. I was relieved because we do not have money and this was a necessity for our daughter who is [XXX]  to get to work. I spoke with the dealership on approximately the 4th or 5th of July and scheduled an appt to  had the car towed on July the 8th.. The car has been at the dealership until today 08/12/2023. The car is not running correctly. The didn't say anything other than the new engine has been placed and we can come pick the car up. This car is a hazard. Please help.

2013 Hyundai Sonata with known engine failure issue. While driving, vehicle experienced complete engine failure during operation in confined express lane of highway. Vehicle was rendered inoperable and required towing to dealer for repair. Delear declared "complete engine failure" and offered to apply for repair assistance through Hyundai engine failure recall assistance, but then repair was declined by Hyundai Motor Co. Same vehicle was in Hyundai service for service/repair 04-23, with check engine light. Hyundai, knowledgeable of engine failure recall, only advised me of a possible fix via high pressure fuel error (another known issue) at cost of $1200.00, with a note to "start here." One year later complete engine failure without any prior warning, light, change in engine performance, etc. Obviously caused by known issues.
We purchased this vehicle used in good condition. We have kept up the maintenance especially oil changes and all recalls. The car uses or burns shall I say a lot of oil between oil changes. It is showing no signs of leaks anywhere and I have had to add at least four quarts of oil so far and it isn't even time to change it yet. The check engine light came on. So, I am about to take it to the shop before it stops on me like I have read in the many complaints here.
The car's engine has a loud rattling noise, the engine vibrates, the check engine flashes, and it lost much of its power . The characteristics of the Recall 162 which has already passed and was fine at that time.

Since November 2021, my 2013 Hyundai Sonata is found to have a dead battery on multiple random occasions. I replaced the battery with a brand new battery twice before bringing it in for inspection at a Hyundai dealer on September 1, 2022.  The dealer diagnosed the problem as an electrical short circuit within the rear view mirror console and replaced said part for $711.   The vehicle has had a dead battery twice since that repair, indicating there is still an electrical draw/short circuit somewhere within the vehicle. Each instance of a dead battery was preceded by rainy humid weather.   I brought the vehicle back to the Hyundai dealer on November 14, 2022. I explained that I suspected moisture was getting in somewhere that it shouldn’t be and causing the electrical short circuit thus draining the battery.   The Hyundai dealer found no electrical short and documented that the electrical system was performing to specifications (no electrical draw found that exceeds 50MA).   There have been no dashboard warning lights or messages indicating the issue. Hyundai has no solution. I have replaced the battery three times within one year.  I am concerned that the undiagnosed electrical problem may lead to a fire while parked and off and/or a dangerous failure while driving.   Vehicle is available for further inspection upon request.
I was driving down the street and the all the dashboard lights came on and suddenly the car died.  My safety was put at risk because it was near the entrance of the highway on ramp. The car was towed to a local shop where they performed diagnostic testing. Upon further inspection, the shop replaced the starter.  However, car will not turn on. Shop stated engine had had failed. The shop stated the car needs to be towed to a Hyundai dealership due to recalls of other Hyundai vehicles.  My car is not included in the recall campaign. Prior to the car stopping, there were no warning lights or engine problems prior.
Engine failure, car seized in traffic
I was traveling north on interstate 295 in New Jersey at 65 mph in the left lane . Without warning my car stated to go into shut down mode loosing speed and forced me to exit onto rt70 in cherry hill when all the dash warning lights came on and the engine shut off. I pulled over to a safe haven. I checked the oil dipstick which was full. I tried to restart the engine and starting hearing a loud metal tapping sound from the engine with multiple dash board warning lights flashing. I immediately shut the car off and called for a 70 mile tow home. I had to Uber other family members home do to no safe seats for 4 people in the tow truck. I started a case number 20174138 with Hyundai  corporate customer service.
The contact's fiancé owns a 2013 Hyundai Sonata. The contact's fiancé received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 22V312000 (Fuel System, Gasoline) however, the part to do the recall repair was not yet available. The contact stated that the manufacturer had exceeded a reasonable amount of time for the recall repair. The contact stated that while his fiancé was driving at an undisclosed speed, a strong fuel odor was detected. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic who advised the contact to tow the vehicle to the dealer. The vehicle was then towed to the dealer where it was diagnosed with a fuel pump leak. The dealer confirmed that parts were not yet available. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 125,000. VIN tool confirms parts not available.
On May 7th 2022 my 2013 Hyundai Sonata engine caught fire just driving down the road. I had only bought it 2 months prior. Smoke started coming pouring out of the vents and I had to pull over and have the fire department put it out.   Hyundai has looked at it and offered to pay off my loan but I gave $4000.00 cash down and now that is lost. They won't cover that.  Will there be another class action lawsuit ?

engine seized up after 2 weeks of having an oil change...stopped on highway had it towed several times from breakdowns on highway to shop they put in new battery it ran for one day and would not start had it towed to another shop was advised the engine seized up due to gunk in oil pan..had an oil change two weeks prior to incident of vehical stopping  was advised  the oil change was fine no problems.....contacted hyundia consumer affairs filed a complaint  advised them of the situation they had me tow the car to the hyundia dealership they looked at the car told me the engine was seized due to gunk in the oil.  i sent them proff of all my oil changes and maintence records.. they denied the claim said i had not enough maintence records i have only had  the vehical for three years have had no problembs with the vehicle untill it hit 99.000 miles...the dealership offered to repair the engine for $7500.. i could not pay. so i had to return the vehical to finance company as i still owed a balance now i am without a vehical and in debt to the finance company. for a vehical that had been on recall..can you assist me with this situation.. I believe they should should have accepted the fault of the engine seizing due to recalled parts.....
there was a clicking noise and vibration coming from the steering column at 65 mph. Have an appointment with Joe Holland Hyundai on November 16th to get checked out.  There was no messages prior to issue.  105,000 miles on car
Issue with loud popping noise coming from the antenna area of the vehicle, and has occurred when vehicle is not on and the keyless entry has not been used. I have tried for almost 3 years to get this resolved. The dealerships hear the noise but could not fix it. Case open with Hyundai USA.
When accelerating to 65 mph, the check engine light came on, and the vehicle stopped accelerating. Took the vehicle in to a mechanic, who stated there was poor acceleration at high RPM's  and the car had jerking symptoms during hard throttle. For the engine diagnosis there was a fault code for the knock sensor found. Very low oil levels were in crankcase, no additional fault codes found, abnormal noises. Signs of internal engine problem low oil pressure suspected, no apparent lubricant to upper part of the engine. Recommended replacing the engine. The mechanic estimated the car was also losing oil faster than it should've. Prior to this incident occuring, the car has been regularly maintenanced at the dealership. Car was taken in to an independent mechanic to be looked at because dealership service repair did not have an opening for 2 weeks to look at the car.  The lower acceleration could cause an accident on the freeway if driving at high speeds and the acceleration malfunctions without warning.  No other persons have looked at the car yet. There was no lights, symptoms, or messages indicating a problem prior to this incident happening. This was the first time this incident has happened with the vehicle.
Check engine light began flashing and my 2013 Hyundai Sonata went into "limp" mode. I checked the code with a diagnostic tool and a P1326 Knock Sensor Detection System code was returned. The car burns oil at an alarming rate, I changed my oil 4,000 miles ago and it burned nearly 4 quarts of oil. There's 133k miles on the car. The dealership in Escondido, California keeps giving me the run around and is trying to charge me full price despite there being a well known engine failure/rod knock recall/campaign with this model/year car.
I purchased (4 tires) 205/65R16 Sumitomo HTR A/S P02  for my vehicle in January 2019. In the past few months I’ve noticed a constant rumbling noise from the rear while driving. I have had my vehicle serviced for an inspection and oil change. Each time I received no recommendations during the multipoint inspections related to my tires. The last time I took it in I mentioned that I planned to purchase new tires and the mechanic looked at me strangely. He measured that my tire thread were at a 6 and he could not see any visible defects. Once the tires were rotated the noise moved from the back to the front. There is clearly a defect with the tire and it is out of warranty to be replaced.
IKUS BOUGHT CAR 3 WEEKS AGO 11000 DOLLARS WAS COMMING HOME WAS TURNING LEFT IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AN MOTOR DIED I COULD BARLEY TURN WHEEL WAS ALMOST HIT BY A SEMI TRUCK DOING 50 MPH AN THEN ALMOST WRECKED I ZCOUDNT TURN WHEEL BACK STRAIGHT BECAUSE NO POWER BECAUSE ENGINE FAILURE I COUDVE DIED OR SOMEONE WHO DIDNT HAVEE SAME STREMGH TO TURN WHEEL IM POOR NOW POORER CAR PAYMENT NO CAR
THE STEERING HAS BECOME LOOSE MAKES A VERY AUDIBLE CLUNKING SOUND WHEN STEERED LEFT AND RIGHT. THERE IS A SEVERE AMOUNT OF PLAY IN THE STEERING YOU CAN TURN IT UP TO 3 IN BEFORE THE VEHICLE ACTUALLY TURNS. IT ALSO CAUSES DRIFT DUE TO THE PLAY. IT MAKES THE CLUNKING NOISE EVEN WHEN SITTING STILL, ALSO HAS THE PLAY IN THE WHEEL WHEN SITTING STILL. IT WILL DRIFT WHILE IN MOTION AND HAVE THE SAME PLAY IN THE WHEEL AND CLUNKING.
I HAVE TO CHANGE TAIL LIGHTS EVERY MONTH. NOW A NEW ASSEMBLY IS REQUIRED BECAUSE THE BLOWN BULB HAS MELTED IT. THIS IS VERY UNSAFE AND I'M TRYING TO AVOID TICKETS AND COURT IF POSSIBLE. ALSO THERE'S A SHORTAGE IN THE WIRING.
WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, I'VE HAD SEVERAL INSTANCES WHERE I PUSH THE GAS PEDAL DOWN AND THE CAR DOES NOT ACCELERATE. THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE IN OTHER HYUNDAI VEHICLES WITH THE BRAKE PEDAL STOPPER AND I'M WONDERING IF MY 2013 HYUNDAI SONATA IS HAVING THIS SAME PROBLEM THAT WAS RECALLED ON MANY OTHER VEHICLES.
STEERING WHEEL MAKES CLICKING AND POPPING SOUND WHEN WHEEL IS TURNED LEFT AND RIGHT, THE VEHICLE IS ALSO PULLING VERY HARD AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. VERY DANGEROUS TO DRIVE.
DRIVING MY CAR 2013 HYUNDAI SONATA FROM NYC TO OHIO, CAR OVERHEATED AND SHUT DOWN ON INTERSTATE 80 WEST BOUND POLICE MANDATED A TOW TO NEARBY MECHANIC WHERE THEY SAID MY THERMOSTAT ALONG WITH THERMOSTAT HOUSING WAS FRIED UP. IT WAS REPLACED ONLY TO 3 MONTHS LATER CAR OVERHEATED AGAIN, ALONG WITH GAS SMELLS IN THE AIR VENTS, AND STALLING AS WELL AS TOTAL ENGINE POWER LOSS. HOWEVER, COUPLE MONTHS LATER, RECALL 189 WAS ISSUED BUT DIDN'T RESOLVE OVERHEATING ISSUE, IN FACT MADE THE CAR REACTED MORE NEGATIVELY. ONE MORE MONTH LATER I WAS NOTIFIED OF HYUNDAI THETA ENGINE CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT SETTLEMENT AND PURSUED NEARBY DEALERSHIP WHO SAID THEY WOULD DIAGNOSE IT, WHICH SHOWED 7 CODERS SHOWING MISFIRE AND ONE FOR BATTERY FAULTY AND ONE FOR THE GAS RAIL AND PIPES. MY DEALERSHIP DIDN'T NOTIFY HYUNDAI THAT I MENTIONED MY CAR HAD BEEN STALLING, SHUTTING ITSELF DOWN A FEW TIMES AND HYUNDAI DENIED MY CLAIM FOR REPAIRS UNDER THIS SETTLEMENT WHICH IS A LIFETIME WARRANTY ON THE ENGINE. THERE IS EXTREMELY SOMETHING FAULTY WITH THE GAS PIPING ON THIS ENGINE
I WAS DRIVING VEHICLE AFTER GETTING GAS AND I SAY WITHIN 15 MINUTES AFTER, VEHICLE STARTED SHUTTING DOWN AND NOISE STARTED TO COME FROM THE ENGINE
YESTERDAY I WAS DRIVING AND OUT OF NOWHERE MY CAR SHUT OFF AND ALL THE LIGHTS CAME ON BUT THE CRAZY PART IS. THE CAR STILL WAS MOVING AND DIDN'T STOP UNTIL I STOPPED AND PULLED OVER.(SO WEIRD) I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND STARTED IT BACK UP. IT CAME ON WITH NO PROBLEMS BUT NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS ON AND IT'S FLASHING. I NEVER SEE A FLASHING CHECK ENGINE LIGHT. BACK TO THE STORY I'M DRIVING BUT I CAN ONLY GO A CERTAIN SPEED OR THE CAR WOULD STALL AND JERK LIKE IT'S ABOUT TO CUT OFF. I DID NOT REPEAT DID NOT STOP UNTIL I MADE IT HOME LOL. THE WHOLE TIME DRIVING IT KEPT STALLING. IN ORDER FOR ME TO GET HOME I HAD TO JUMP ON THE HIGHWAY BUT I TOOK BACK ROADS JUST BECAUSE I WAS SCARED THE CAR WOULD STOP ON THE HIGHWAY.O AND DON'T LET ME STOP AT A RED LIGHT HUNNI, IT'S TAKING ITS TIME TO GET UP SOME SPEED. THIS THE SECOND OR THIRD TIME IT DID THAT BUT THIS TIME THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. IS THIS UNDER A RECALL? IF NOT IT DEFINITELY SHOULD BE BECAUSE THAT WAS SO [XXX] SCARY DRIVING. THAT WAS THE LONGEST 23 MINS EVER LOL.    PARTS OF THIS DOCUMENT HAVE BEEN REDACTED TO PROTECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).
OUT OF NO WHERE THE TRANSMISSION STARTED TO GIVE ME ISSUES. IT NOW TAKES LONGER FOR THE GEAR TO CHANGE FROM A STOP, REVING MY CAR PAST 4,000 RPM'S TO 5,000RPM'S. WHEN BREAKING THE GEARS JERK WHEN LOWERING, AND WHEN DRIVING WITH CRUISE CONTROL, MY CAR WILL NOT STAY THE SAME PACE. IT WIL LAG OR IT WILL KICK HIGHER, EITHER WAY MAKING MY CAR JERK.
TL* THE CONTACT'S DAUGHTER OWNS A 2013 HYUNDAI SONATA. THE CONTACT STATED WHILE DRIVING 55 MPH, THE VEHICLE HESITATED WITH AN ABNORMAL VIBRATION. THE CONTACT STATED MULTIPLE UNKNOWN WARNING LIGHTS WERE ILLUMINATED. THE CONTACT PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROADWAY, RESTARTED THE VEHICLE AND CONTINUED DRIVING TO HIS DESTINATION.

THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED HOWEVER, THE FAILURE RECURRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS INFORMED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 80,000.
I WAS DRIVING 70 MPH ON THE HIGHWAY AND THE CAR JUST LOST POWER. I HAD TWO KIDS IN THE BACK SEAT. I AM ALL UP TO DATE WITH MY CAR MAINTENANCE.   I REALLY DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING MY HYUNDAI SONATA.  *TR
I WAS TRAVELING TO HOUSTON TEXAS ON APRIL 17, 2020 WHEN I NOTICED MY SERVICE ENGINE CHECK LIGHT WENT ON. I HAD JUST PASSED SWEETWATER TEXAS SO I DRIVE TO THE NEAREST AUTOZONE WHICH WAS LOCATED AT STORE #1367  311 E COMMERCE, BROWNWOOD, TEXAS 76801AND HAD IT CHECKED THEY SAID IT WAS FUEL RAIL SYSTEM PRESSURE WAS TOO LOW. THIS IS WHEN I DISCOVERED IT HAD A RECALL ON IT FOR THE SAME THING.  DO I NEED TO RETURN TO DEALERSHIP I BOUGHT FROM AND ARE THEY RESPONSIBLE FOR SELLING CAR AS IS WITH A RECALL ON IT. THE RECALL WAS ISSUED ONE DAY AFTER I PURCHASED VEHICLE. I'M STILL DRIVING VEHICLE AND DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO GET IT REPAIRED MYSELF. I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY  AT THE TIME OF ALL THIS.  *TR
HAVING TO REPLACE EXTERIOR BACK RUNNING / BRAKE LIGHT BULBS AT LEAST OR NEAR EVERY 2 MONTHS. NOTICED THAT MAYBE THE BULB IS GETTING TO HOT CAUSING THE LENS TO WRAP WHICH IS MAKING CHANGING THE BULB A REAL TASK AND HARD TO GET THE BULB BACK IN PLACE. GETTING READY TO CHANGE IT AGAIN TODAY (3/10/2020).
OK I'M AM SERIOUSLY GOING TO START LOOKING INTO FILING A CLASS ACTION AGAINST HYUNDAI. FOR THE 6-7TH TIME MY BRAKE LIGHTS ARE MELTING AND BURNING OUT. AT THIS POINT IT'S BECOME A SAFETY ISSUE DRIVING AROUND AT NIGHT OR EARLY MORNING WITH NO BRAKE LIGHTS. HOW HAS THIS NOT BEEN RESOLVED BY NOW? THE COST OF REPAIRS IS TOO MUCH FOR THE ISSUE TO NOT EVEN BEING RESOLVED. ALMOST EVERY HYUNDAI I SEE HAS BRAKE LIGHTS OUT AND PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY TELLING ME MY LIGHTS ARE OUT. EVEN POLICE NOTE HYUNDAI DRIVERS HAVE A CONSTANT ISSUE WITH THIS. THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL NOW!
WHILE DRIVING OUT OF TOWN 2 HOURS AWAY FROM HOME ON MAJOR HIGHWAY CAR SUDDENLY STOPPED. HAD MY 3 CHILDREN IN THE BACK AND HAD TO GET IN THE MIDDLE  LANE AND TURN MY HAZARDS ON AND CALL A TOWN TRUCK. I HAD TO PAY 300 DOLLARS TO GET THE CAR TOWED HOME. WHILE SEARCHING ONLINE I SAW A ENGINE RECALL AND SEVERAL OTHER RECALLS FOR THE 2013 HYUNDAI SONATA. I CALLED THE HYUNDAI RECALL  LINE AND THEY SET UP AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE THE CAR CHECKED OUT. I CALLED HYUNDAI AND ASKED IF THEY HAD ANY TOW SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDED, THEY STATED THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR TOW SERVICES SO I THEN PAYED 60 DOLLARS TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO HYUNDAI BY AAA WHICH HYUNDAI ADVICES. HYUNDAI CALLED AND INFORMED ME THE NEXT DAY THAT THEY PUT IT ON THE MACHINE AND THAT IT WAS THE ENGINE THAT FAILED AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO ORDER AN ENGINE FROM HYUNDAI THEY ALSO INFORMED ME THAT I WOULD BE CHARGED 150 DOLLARS FOR THEM TO GET THE KEY FOB TO WORK TO THE CAR. AFTER HYUNDAI RECEIVED THE NEW ENGINE THEY CALLED AND INFORMED ME THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO PULL THE ENGINE IN AND OUT OF THE CAR DUE TO FROM END DAMAGE WHICH INCLUDED THE RADIATOR, MOTOR BLOWER, AND  HEAD GASKET AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE TO PAY 2895 DOLLARS FOR THEM TO EVEN PUT THE ENGINE IN THE CAR. HE ASKED ME IF THE DEALERSHIP I BOUGHT THE CAR FROM HAD REPORTED ANY WRECKS WHERE THE FRONT END COULD BE DAMAGED. I THEN EXPLAINED TO THE MANAGER OF HYUNDAI MECHANICS THAT I HAVE A CLEAR BLUE TITLE AND IN ORDER FOR THERE TO BE A WRECK THAT CAUSED FRONT END DAMAGE I WOULD BY LAW HAVE TO HAVE A SAVAGE TITLE.I WAS SOLD THE CAR AS IS FROM CAR LOT BUT WAS INFORMED THERE WERE NO ACCIDENT AND HAD BEEN CERTIFIED TESTED. LOOKING ONLINE AND SPEAKING WITH ANOTHER MECHANIC I WAS INFORMED THAT RADIATOR MOTOR BLOWER AND HEAD GASKET ARE ARE CAUSES DUE TO AN CAR RUNNING HOT FROM ENGINE FAILURE.SPEAKING WITH CORPORATE THEY MADE FALSE PROMISES AND THEN DECLINED.
TRANSMISSION HEAT SENSOR FAILURE, CAUSING CAR TO HAVE PROPULSION ISSUES IN TRAFFIC. THIS IS A COMPLAINT BY SEVERAL OWNERS FROM 2011 THROUGH 2014.
JUST RECENTLY MY STEERING WHEEL STARTED HAVING A CLICKING SOUND WHEN TURNED IN EITHER DIRECTION IT IS GETTING  WORSE EVERY DAY.STEERING IS REAL LOOSE SEEMS LIKE I HAVE LESS CONTROL.I WAS TOLD IT'S PROBABLY A BUSHING AND THAT THERE WAS A RECALL BUT I HAVEN'T FOUND ANYTHING
THERE HAS BEEN AN UNIDENTIFIABLE CLICK IN THE STEERING SINCE PURCHASED NEW. MAKES HORRIBLE NOISES NOW WHEN DRIVING AND WHEN HITTING SLIGHTEST BUMPS IN ROAD. THIS APPEARS TO BE A WIDESPREAD ISSUE AND SHOULD BE A RECALL. OUR REPAIR SHOP DIDN'T WANT TO WORK ON IT AND SAID THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A RECALL, BUT I CANNOT FIND ONE.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE!
TAKATA RECALL. THE DEALERSHIP SAYS IT HAS BEEN REPAIRED, BUT I HAVE NO RECORD OF THEM EVER HAVING REPAIRED IT. THANKS, RLC
TAKATA RECALL IM DRIVING ON SMALL ROAD ABOUT TO MAKE A LEFT TURN IN MY 2013 HYUNDAI SONATA CAR COMPLETELY SHUT OFF DASHBOARD LIGHT BLINKING LIKE THE CARS BATTERY WENT DEAD. MADE A SLIGHT TICKING NOSE WHEN I TRIED TO RESTART CAR WOULD NOT START. HAD TO DISCONNECT THE BATTERY FOR THE CAR LIGHT TO STOP BLINKING.
WHILE DRIVING AND MY PHONE IS ON THE GAS PEDAL MY CAR LIVES IN THE MIDDLE OF ME PUSHING THE GAS  SO I HAD TO TAKE MY FOOT OFF THE GAS AND PUSH IT DOWN ON IT AGAIN
STEERING COUPLER HAS GONE BAD. THIS IS A CRITICAL SAFETY COMPONENT WHICH HAS A LONG HISTORY OF BEING DEFECTIVE ON HYUNDAI VEHICLES. I ALSO HAVE A 2011 HYUNDAI THAT HAD TO HAVE THIS ITEM REPLACED.  ALTHOUGH THIS HAS HAD THE WARRANTY EXTENDED THIS ITEM SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE LONG LIST OF RECALLED ITEMS ON THESE VEHICLES.
I WAS DRIVING AND AS I WAS MAKING A TURN, THE STEERING WHEEL SEIZED.  AS I WAS TRYING TO TURN OUT OF THE TURN, THE WHEEL UNSEIZED AND TURNED THE WAY I WAS TRYING TO TURN IT, BUT THEN WENT SLACK WHICH CAUSED THE CAR TO START DRIFTING TO THE RIGHT EVEN THOUGH I WAS TRYING TO STRAIGHTEN OUT. THEN I FELT THE STEERING CATCH AND I WAS ABLE TO CONTROL THE CAR AS NORMAL.  I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALER NEXT WEEK SO THEY CAN CHECK IT OUT.  THIS SHOULD REALLY BE A RECALL.  IT IS VERY DANGEROUS.
LAST YEAR 2017 WE HAD CAR IN FOR INSPECTION AND IT ALSO HAD A RECALL AT TIME.  DO THE INSPECTION AND RECALL.  RECALL WAS FOR METAL SHAVINGS IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  WE GOT VEHICLE BACK AND WAS TOLD EVERYTHING WAS FINE.  THIS YEAR 2018 AFTER AN OIL CHANGE AT JIFFY LUBE THERE WAS AN ENGINE NOISE.  THEN WE GOT A RECALL ABOUT THE COMPUTER CHANGE WITH THE BEARING WEAR ISSUE'S WE HAD THE OIL CHANGED BEFORE WE TOOK IT IN NOT FOND OF SERVICE AT FAULKNER.  SO THEY WERE TO DO THE RECALL AND TO PLEASE CHECK THE ENGINE NOISE WE STILL HEAR IT ONCE AND A WHILE.  WE ALSO DID A CASE WITH HYUNDAI WITH ENGINE NOISE ISSUE AND THE FACT THAT THIS LAST RECALL WAS NOT A FIX IT WAS A COVER YOUR [XXX] RECALL.  I DID NOT WANT ANYONE IN MY FAMILY DRIVING A CAR THAT THE ENGINE COULD JUST SLOW DOWN ON THE HIGHWAY.  CAR IS USED FOR LONG DISTANCE DRIVING TO AND FROM WORK..  200 MILES A DAY.  DOING 70 -75 ON HIGHWAY THINKING THAT THE ENGINE COULD SLOW DOWN AND YOU HAVE TRACTOR TRAILERS ON YOUR BUMPER DOES NOT GIVE ME A WARM AND FUZZY FEELING.  AFTER WE TOOK IT IN FOR THIS RECALL THEY TOLD US THEY COULD NOT CHECK THE ENGINE FOR METAL SHAVINGS DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE JUST CHANGED THE OIL.  NOW IF THIS IS THE CASE WHY DID THEY NOT TELL US THIS THE LAST TIME THEY "CHECKED THE ENGINE"  THINKING THEY DID NOT CHECK IT CAUSE THEY DID NOT CHANGE THE OIL.  I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT I STILL DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN THIS CAR.  WHAT CAN BE DONE AT THIS POINT?  THE CAR HAS 140,000 THOUSAND MILES AND OTHER THEN THIS ENGINE IT MIGHT LAST ANOTHER COUPLE YEARS.  THE ENGINE MAKES THE NOISE WHILE SITTING STILL, BUT NOT ALL THE TIME.  NOBODY AT THE DEALER WANTS TO TAKE THE CAR AND DRIVE IT FOR A WHILE.  THE CASE WAS CLOSED AFTER WE TOOK THE CAR TO DEALER FAULKNER OF HYUNDAI BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT CHECK FOR ENGINE METAL.  THIS WAS MARCH OF 2019.  I DO NOT HAVE THE CASE NUMBER  BECAUSE OF THIS THE CAR HAS NO RESALE VALUE.  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 HYUNDAI SONATA. THE CONTACT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 18V934000 (ENGINE, FUEL SYSTEM, GASOLINE). THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE MANUFACTURER EXCEEDED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THE RECALL REPAIR. THE DEALER (PIAZZA HYUNDAI OF WEST CHESTER, 1360 WILMINGTON PIKE, WEST CHESTER, PA 19382, (610)-399-3100) WAS CONTACTED AND CONFIRMED THAT THE PARTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE RECALL REMEDY. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE ISSUE. THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE. PARTS DISTRIBUTION DISCONNECT.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 15 MPH, THE VEHICLE STALLED WITHOUT WARNING. THE DEALER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 78,000.
STEERING WHEEL NOISE/CLUNK. I AM EXPERIENCING A NOISE IN THE STEERING WHEEL. AFTER RESEARCH I SAW ALOT OF PEOPLE REPORTING THE SAME ISSUE ON YOU TUBE. A FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAS THE SAME MODEL HAD THE SAME ISSUE AND HAD IT FIXED. LOOKS LIKE IT'S A COMMON ISSUE ON THIS MODEL CARS.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 HYUNDAI SONATA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE MANUFACTURER ISSUED NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 18V137000 (AIR BAGS AND SEAT BELTS) ON FEBRUARY 27, 2018. PRIOR TO THE RECALL, THE CONTACT WAS INVOLVED IN A CRASH. THE CONTACT WAS AT A STOP LIGHT WHEN ANOTHER VEHICLE CRASHED INTO THE REAR OF HER VEHICLE. AS A RESULT, THE CONTACT'S VEHICLE SLAMMED INTO THE PRECEDING VEHICLE. NONE OF THE AIR BAGS DEPLOYED. A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED. THE DRIVER, FRONT PASSENGER, AND TWO REAR PASSENGERS SUSTAINED WHIPLASH, NECK PAIN, AND BACK PAIN THAT REQUIRED MEDICAL ATTENTION. THE INSURANCE COMPANY WAS NOTIFIED AND THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED. GREAT LAKES HYUNDAI (9630 OH-14, STREETSBORO, OH 44241, (330) 422-1212) WAS CONTACTED, BUT DID NOT DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE AIR BAG FAILURE. THE MANUFACTURER SENT A LETTER ON JULY 9, 2016 STATING THAT THE SYSTEM FUNCTIONED NORMALLY. THE COLLISION DAMAGES WERE REPAIRED BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY. THE CONTACT WAS UNCERTAIN IF THE MANUFACTURER WOULD AUTHORIZE THE RECALL REPAIR. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED PRIOR TO THE RECALL BEING ISSUED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS NOT AVAILABLE.
STEERING MALFUNCTION OCCURRED ABOUT 10 MINUTES INTO A DRIVE ON THE HIGHWAY.  WHILE TRAVELLING ABOUT 45 TO 50MPH, THE CAR UNEXPECTEDLY STARTED PULLING TO THE RIGHT, AND WOULD NOT RESPOND WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL WAS TURNED TO THE LEFT.  IT WAS ALMOST LIKE CHANGING LANES, IN THAT WHILE THE CAR WAS GOING FORWARD, IT ALSO KEPT MOVING TO THE RIGHT.  THE CAR WOULD NOT CHANGE DIRECTION, EVEN THOUGH I KEPT TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL TO THE LEFT.  THIS CONTINUED ACROSS SEVERAL LANES OF THE HIGHWAY, UNTIL THE CAR HIT THE HIGHWAY BARRIER WALL.      THE AIRBAG DEPLOYED, AND THANK GOD THAT I WAS ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE CAR, AND THEN CALL 911.  THERE WAS DAMAGE MAINLY TO THE RIGHT-FRONT OF THE CAR.  BOTH THE OFFICER AND THE INSURANCE ADJUSTER CHECKED AND CONCLUDED THAT THE TIRES WERE IN GOOD CONDITION.  THE ENGINE STILL STARTED WITHOUT HESITATION, HOWEVER DUE TO THE ENTIRE REPAIR COST, THE INSURANCE COMPANY TOTALED THE CAR.      CONSIDERING THAT THERE WERE MANY OTHER VEHICLES ON THE HIGHWAY AT THAT TIME, IT WAS A MIRACLE THAT MY CAR DID NOT HIT ANY OTHER CARS, AND THAT OTHER CARS DID NOT HIT MY CAR.      THE NHTSA SERIOUSLY NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE THIS DANGEROUS SONATA VEHICLE-STEERING ISSUE, TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN, AND BEFORE IT RESULTS IN EVEN MORE HAZARDOUS, OR TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES.
TAKATA RECALL:  MY 2013 HYUNDAI SANOTA IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH OIL OR TO THE BEARIMGS I HAVE ALREADY TAKEN THE CAR TO THE HYUNIDA DEALERSHIP AND LET THEM FIX THE 5 RECALLS IT ALREADY HAD ON IT WHICH ONE WAS THIS ISSUE AFTER THE FACT THEY WAS "FIXED" 3 MONTHS LATER IN CONSTANTLY HAVING TO REPLACE PURGE VALVE MANIFISTER VALVES PRETTY MUCH AND THING THAY HAS TO DO WITH FUEL OR AIR OR GAS GETTING TO THE ENGINE NOW ITS CONSTENTLY STALLING WHEN IM ON THE EXPRESSWAY AMD TODAY SMOKE STARTED COMING OUT FROM UNDER THE HOOD I REALLY LIKED THIS CAR IT ONLY HAS 103,000 MILES ON IT I DO ALL THE DEALERSHIP RECOMMENDED MAINTENCE AMF THIS IS WHAT I GET VERY UPSET WITH HYUDAI SENSE THEY SUPPOSABLY FIXED THE RECALL FOR THAT ALREADY THERES NOTHING THEY CAN DO SO THERES 10,000.00 DOLLARS DOWN THE DRAIN
THE GLASS SUNROOF EXPLODED FOR NO REASON.. I WAS DRIVING 9/5/18 ABOUT 5PM, NO ONE IN FRONT OF ME, NOTHING OVERHEADS,  AND I HEARD A LOUD SOUND (LIKE A BULLET) DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING AROUND ME,  THE WINDSHIELD LOOKED FINE, BUT THE GLASS SUNROOF  HAD SHATTERED. THANK GOODNESS THE INSIDE ROOF LINER WAS CLOSED AND THE SHATTERED GLASS DID NOT FALL ON MY FACE OR INTO MY CAR.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE DRIVING VARIOUS SPEEDS, AN ABNORMAL NOISE WAS HEARD WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL WAS TURNED TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT. THERE WERE NO WARNING INDICATORS ILLUMINATED. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE EXPERIENCED THE SAME SYMPTOMS AS LISTED IN THE MANUFACTURER'S EXTENDED WARRANTY: TXX7 (STEERING). THE VEHICLE WAS NOT TAKEN TO A DEALER FOR DIAGNOSTIC TESTING OR REPAIRS. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 97,000.
I HAVE BEEN HAVING AN ONGOING ISSUE ON MY 2013 HYUNDAI SONATA LIMITED. IF YOU JUST LOOK AT 2011+ HYUNDAI SONATA'S ON THE ROAD WHILE DRIVING 90% OF THEM HAVE A TAIL LIGHT OUT! THE ISSUE IS THE TAIL LIGHT ASSEMBLY WHERE THE BULB CLIPS IN IS MELTED SO THE BULB WILL NOT STAY IN PLACE. THE BULB IS CONSTANTLY MOVING AROUND WHILE DRIVING SO IT COMES LOSE OR BLOWS OVER AND OVER. THE ONLY PROPER FIX FOR THIS IS TO CHANGE THE WHOLE TAIL LIGHT SO I BELIEVE HYUNDAI NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS AS IF YOUR TAIL LIGHTS ARE OUT YOU CAN EASILY MEET IN AN ACCIDENT. I HAVE CHANGED MY BULB AT LEAST 6 TIMES FOR FAR AND I HAVE ONLY HAD THE CAR FOR 6 MONTHS, ITS A 2013 HYUNDAI SONATA LIMITED 2.4 NON TURBO NA. I SEARCHED SEVERAL FORUMS ONLINE AND OTHERS HAVE REPORTED THIS ISSUE OR SPEND $300 TO FIX ONE OR $00 FOR BOTH. THIS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT THE TAIL LIGHT SHOULD NOT BE MELTING.
"TAKATA RECALL" CASE # 11315399. PASSENGER BRAKE LIGHT IS INOPERATIVE. HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT DETERMINED THAT BOTH TAIL LAMP HOUSING IS WARPED AND IN NEED OF REPLACEMENT. HYUNDAI CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE FURTHER EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS CONDITION OCCURRING IS THAT  THE HOUSING SOCKET HEATS UP AND IS THE CAUSE OF THE WARPING. I BROUGHT THIS TO THE DEALERSHIP ATTENTION ABOUT A POSSIBLE ELECTRICAL DEFECT ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS. I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH HYUNDAI USA GOOD WILL DEPARTMENT AND REQUESTED THAT THEY REPAIR THE VEHICLE, THEY DECLINED BASED ON THE WARRANTY EXPIRATION.     THE TAIL LAMP HOUSING WARPING ON ANY VEHICLE IS NOT A NORMAL OCCURRENCE DURING THE LIFE OF A VEHICLE. FURTHER, HYUNDAI IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM. THEY HAVE BEEN REQUIRING CUSTOMERS TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS ON AFFECTED VEHICLES.     THE CONSUMER SHOULD BE ABLE TO REPLACE THE LAMP BULB AND NOT THE LAMP HOUSING AS A GENERAL WEAR AND TEAR OPERATION.  I PRESENTLY HAVE A VEHICLE THAT I CAN NOT DRIVE DUE THE EXORBITANT COST TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM. I AM REQUESTING THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER IN ORDER TO GENERATE A RECALL ON THIS VEHICLE FOR DEFECTIVE TAIL LAMP OR WIRING HOUSING PROBLEM.
THE CAR CONFRONTS PROBLEMS WITH THE AIR BARGS SYSTEM. THIS HAPPENED TO US IN THE AFTERNOON AFTER A CHANGE OF LIGHT THE CAR WAS RUNNING AT 8 TO 10 MPH AND SUDDENLY WITHOUT ANY WARNING THE CAR EXPLODED THE FRONT AIR BAGS AND BOTH OF THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER DOORS.
TRAVELING ON HIGHWAY 65MPH REAR ENDED 2 CARS AT A GLANCING ANGLE WHILE ATTEMPTING TO AVOID THE CRASH. DRIVER SIDE FRONT FENDER, BUMPER ETC DAMAGED. AIR BAG DID NOT DEPLOY. THERE IS A SENSOR EXACTLY IN THE SPOT OF IMPACT. I STILL HAVE THAT SENSOR IF ANY TESTING EXISTS FOR FAULTY UNIT.

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE DRIVING 30 MPH, A CLICKING SOUND WAS HEARD COMING FROM THE ENGINE. ALSO, A RUBBING SOUND WAS PRESENT WHILE MAKING RIGHT TURNS AND THE ENGINE REVVED. THE DEALER COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE ISSUE, BUT THE AIR CONDITIONER WAS REPAIRED DUE TO A LEAK AND THE HABITUAL AND IGNITION SWITCH WERE REPLACED; HOWEVER, THE NOISES WERE STILL PRESENT. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE ISSUE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 80,000.
STEERING DEVICE COUPLING LOOSE OR DEFECTIVE SHOULD BE REPLACED AS A DEFECTIVE PART PER LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP. SHOULD BE UNDER RECALL ON THE SONATAS AS THE PROBLEM IS GETTING MORE COMMON.
TAKATA RECALL , MY LIGHT BULBS SEEM TO BLOW OUT MORE THAN USUAL ON MY CAR AND ON THE PASSENGER SIDE THE BAKE BRAKE LIGHT BULB BLEW OUT AND I WENT TO REPLACE IT AND I HAD TROUBLE REMOVING THE BULB BECAUSE IT HAD MELTED THE  AREA THAT YOU STICK THE BULB INSIDE OF I'M WORRIED THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE WIRING  AND I'M SURE THIS IS HAPPENING AT ANYTIME MY LIGHTS OR ON.  *TR
WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD, WHETHER IT BE ON THE HIGHWAY OR CITY STREETS, THE STEERING WHEEL STICKS AT THE CENTER POSITION AND IT NEEDS TO BE TUGGED ON TO GET IT TO MOVE.  IT STARTED OUT NOT THAT NOTICEABLE BUT AS TIME HAS PASSED IT HAS GOTTEN WORSE.  BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM OF THE STEERING WHEEL STICKING THE CAR  SWERVES QUITE A BIT WHILE DRIVING.  I WAS TOLD BY THE HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP THAT IT WAS THE STEERING COLUMN THAT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO WORSEN IF NOT REPAIRED.  THIS ITEM IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY AND I CAN'T SEE HOW IT CANNOT BE A DANGER TO DRIVE THE CAR IN THIS STATE.  *TR
MY STEERING COUPLER IS DANADGED AND MY STEERING IS SHIFTING WHILE DRIVING DUE TO THIS DEFECT. HYUNDAI IS ASKING ME TO PAY $300 TO FIX IT. EVEN MY CAR IS JUST 3 YEARS OLD THEY ARE NOT COVERING THE ISSUE UNDER WARRANTY.
VEHICLE HAS 70000 MILES.  BOTH FRONT COIL SPRINGS ARE BROKEN DUE TO CORROSION.  FOUND ON INSPECTION AT DEALERSHIP.  VERY PREMATURE FAILURE .  IF NOT FOUND COULD HAVE LED TO TIRE PUNCTURE AND POSSIBLE ACCIDENT.
VEHICLE WAS NOT USED FOR ABOUT 4 WEEKS IN FEBRUARY.  THEN THE CAR WAS STARTED IN REVERSE WITH THE FOOT ON THE BRAKE PEDAL.  PEDAL WENT MUSHY WITH LITTLE TO NO PRESSURE RESULTING BASIC LOSS OF BRAKE FUNCTION WHILE MAKING LOUD NOISES.  HAD TO STOP VEHICLE WITH PARKING BRAKE.  HAD VEHICLE TOWED TO DEALER.  SERVICE MANAGER DROVE VEHICLE, ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROBLEM, AND INDICATED THAT RUST HAD ACCUMULATED ON ROTORS.  HE SAID HIGH/LOW SPOTS DUE TO RUST CAN RESULT IN LOSS OF BRAKE PRESSURE, AND LOUD NOISE WAS A RESULT OF BRAKE PADS RUBBING ON UNEVEN SURFACES.  AFTER DEALER TECHNICIAN DROVE SEVERAL MILES AND APPLIED BRAKES, RUST WORE OFF AND BRAKE FUNCTION RETURNED. THE DEALER SERVICE MANAGER SAID THE CAR SHOULD BE DRIVEN EVERY COUPLE DAYS OR AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING.  HE INDICATED HE COULD TURN THE ROTORS BUT THE RUST WOULD JUST RETURN.  I HAVE NEVER OWNED A VEHICLE IN 30 YEARS WHERE THE ROTORS ARE SO PRONE TO RUST RESULTING IN BRAKE FAILURE IF NOT DRIVEN FOR 4 WEEKS, MUCH LESS A WEEK.  THANKFULLY THIS WAS NOT NOTICED AT HIGHER SPEED ON A ROAD OR THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT IN THE MAKING.  I BELIEVE THERE COULD BE A ROTOR MATERIAL DESIGN OR QUALITY ISSUE THAT IS PROMOTING CORROSION AT SUCH A RAPID RATE.  DEALER'S INVOICE IS ATTACHED FOR REFERENCE.
ENGINE SUDDENLY WITHOUT ANY PRIOR INDICATORS STOPPED WORKING WHILE DRIVING 60 MPH ON HWY.  LOST ALL POWER INCLUDING POWER BRAKING AND STEERING.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 HYUNDAI SONATA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING AT APPROXIMATELY 30 MPH, THE CHECK ENGINE WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED AND THE VEHICLE FAILED TO ACCELERATE WHEN THE ACCELERATOR PETAL WAS DEPRESSED. IN ADDITION, WHEN PARKED, THE VEHICLE HAD A DELAYED START WHEN THE KEY WAS TURNED TO THE START POSITION. THE FAILURE OCCURRED CONSTANTLY. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 52,772.
I WAS DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE AT 65MPH AND MY ENGINE SEIZED WITHOUT WARNING. I DRIFTED OFF OF THE ROAD AND CONTACTED HYUNDAI ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP. AFTER 3 BUSINESS DAYS OF NOT GETTING ANY ANSWERS ON THE PROBLEM FROM THE DEALERSHIP THEY FINALLY CALLED ME AND SAID THE ENGINE HAD "SLUDGE" AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE CAR IS A 2013 THAT I PURCHASED IN 10/2012 AND HAD 45,000 MILES AT THE TIME OF THIS INCIDENT. I WAS INFORMED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THAT COULD BE DONE AND THE WARRANTY WAS DECLINED DUE TO LACK OF MAINTENANCE (OIL CHANGES). I JUST HAD MY OIL CHANGED THE SAME DAY THAT THIS HAPPENED. I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THEY COULD DO AND A USED ENGINE WOULD COST $4,000+. I DECLINED THE SERVICE. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE AT BOTH HYUNDAI AND THE DEALERSHIP IS AWFUL. MY CAR IS STILL AT THE DEALERSHIP. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 25 MPH, THE BRAKES FAILED TO RESPOND WHEN DEPRESSED. AS A RESULT, THE VEHICLE ACCELERATED THROUGH A RED LIGHT AND AVOIDED A CRASH. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER. THE TECHNICIAN STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS FUNCTIONING AS DESIGNED.

WE PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE NEW FOR MY WIFE. I DROVE THE CAR HOME FROM MARYLAND WHERE WE BOUGHT IT. I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY MAINTAINING MY LANE ON THE WAY HOME. I THOUGHT IT WAS DUE TO HAVE MANUAL STEERING ON ANOTHER CAR AND AN SUV AS A SECOND VEHICLE. MY WIFE DROVE THE CAR TO MY HOME IN HAMPTON AND HAD THE SAME PROBLEM MAINTAINING HER LANE. I DROVE IT BACK TO WOODBRIDGE SINCE SHE WAS SCARED OF THE CAR AFTER THE STEERING ISSUE. I CONTINUED TO OVERSTEER THE CAR AND HAVE PROBLEMS JUST MAINTAINING A STRAIGHT TRACK. THE VEHICLE REQUIRED CONSTANT MODIFICATIONS TO THE STEERING WHEEL TO STAY IN THE LANE. THE PRESSURE REQUIRED TO MOVE THE STEERING ALSO SEEMED EXCESSIVE. I TOOK THE VEHICLE AFTER COMPLAINING TO CORPORATE HYUNDAI. THEY SET AN APPOINTMENT FOR ME TO GET THE CAR STEERING REPROGRAMMED. SINCE REPROGRAMMING THE VEHICLE IT STEERED A LOT BETTER. THE PROBLEM NOW SEEMS TO BE NOW THAT AT MEDIUM TO HIGH SPEEDS THE VEHICLE RESPONDS RAPIDLY TO STEERING INPUT AND IN EVASIVE MANEUVERS SEEMS UNCONTROLLABLE AS IT OVERSTEERS RAPIDLY. I REALLY FEEL A RECALL NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THESE CARS AND WONDER HOW MANY RUNNING OFF THE ROAD ACCIDENTS HAVE OCCURRED DUE TO THIS VERY HORRIBLE STEERING DESIGN. THE REST OF THE CAR IS GOOD EXCEPT FOR THE IGNITION BEING ABLE TO BE TURNED OFF ACCIDENTALLY WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION. I FILED A COMPLAINT ALSO ABOUT THAT BEFORE THIS COMPLAINT.  *TR
STEERING, VEERING ONE WAY THEN ANOTHER. SOMETIMES THE STEERING WHEEL SEEMS STUCK OR IS STICKING, NOT HAPPY AT ALL. HAD IT BACK TO DEALER & SAID IT WAS IN SPEC. HELP  *TR
VEHICLE WILL NOT HOLD A STRAIGHT LINE AND WONDERS ALL OVER THE ROAD.  *TR
CAR PULLS TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT AND CAN'T KEEP STRAIGHT ON THE HIGHWAY. FEELS DANGEROUS AND UNSAFE! REQUIRING CONSTANT CORRECTIONS OF THE STEERING MAKES DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY STRESSFUL.  *TR
I WAS ON THE RIGHT MOST LANE ON HIGHWAY 121 AT 70 MILES SPEED WHEN MY CAR STARTED PULLING RIGHT & LEFT AS IF IT WAS SKIDDING ON ICE. THE WEATHER WAS FINE. IT WAS VERY SCARY. I WAS HOLDING THE STEERING WITH BOTH HANDS. AFTER THAT DAY, WHENEVER I GO OVER THE SPEED OF 60, CAR STARTS PULLING LEFT & RIGHT. I HAVE TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAYS.  *TR
TL* HE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 HYUNDAI SONATA GLS. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHEN THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WAS RELEASED, THE VEHICLE WOULD CONTINUE ACCELERATING, AS IF THE CONTACT WAS STILL DEPRESSING THE ACCELERATOR. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE DEALER WHO PERFORMED A DIAGNOSTIC TEST BUT WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE FAILURE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE ISSUE BUT WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE ANY ASSISTANCE TO THE CONTACT DUE TO THE FAILURE NOT BEING ABLE TO BE DIAGNOSED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 400 AND THE CURRENT MILEAGE WAS 1,950.
The contact owns a 2014 Hyundai Sonata. The contact stated that the vehicle was inspected by a mechanic, and during the test drive, the vehicle experienced a loss of automotive power. There was no warning light illuminated. The local dealer was contacted; however, the vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The contact referenced NHTSA Campaign Number: 17V226000 (ENGINE AND ENGINE COOLING) as a possible cause for the failure. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 68,000.
Due to a recall Hyundai promised a lifetime extended warranty on the engine of my 2014 Hyundai Sonata concerning a defect in the engine manufacturing. We're as metal shavings can cause rod bearings to wear out causing what is known as engine knocking noise. Well my engine is knocking, and I was told by a license certified mechanic that it's my rod bearings & that the engine is fixing to throw a rod. This is covered under the extended lifetime warranty.  When I called Hyundai they said we aren't going to fix the issue because the vehicle has a salvaged title.  I had a consumer rear ended me years ago, there insurance company totaled out my car which was not totaled. Only minor rear damage. I ended up keeping the car and it drove fine, no engine damage due to the wreck on rear end damage.  This shouldn't stop my rights to a new engine which Hyundai promised during a lifetime extension of the engine. This is considered unfair Deceptive Trade Practice Act violation.
I was driving and my car started beeping and the wheel jerked to the left and my car slowed down from 65mph to 20mph and almost caused me to have an accident. After I replaced the breaking module, my battery started shorting out and my car once again jerked off to the side and then slowed down abruptly from 65 mph to 20mph.
The contact owns a 2014 Hyundai Sonata. The contact stated while driving 70 MPH, the engine seized. The contact stated that several unknown warning lights were illuminated. The contact and several nearby drivers pushed the vehicle to the shoulder of the roadway.  The contact started the vehicle; however, the failure reoccurred. The contact researched and discovered a reported failure that identified the rearview camera as the source of the failure. The contact stated that the article instructed to disconnect the rearview camera to stop the electrical failure. The contact disconnected the rearview camera. The contact stated that there were no more failure occurrences after the rearview camera was disconnected. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 114,000.
The driver's seat lost a bolt and the seat was no longer bolted down at the back, although sitting on it would lower it. I took it to a mechanic and they re-attached the screw and bolt but were unable to do so in a way that the seat operates properly. It still lifts when I get out of the car and lowers when I sit down. This is available for inspection if needed. The safety concern is that in the event of an accident, the seat may detach from the base of the car. The problem has been reproduced by an independent service center. The work was done in Feb 2022. The vehicle hasn't been inspected by any others. There were no warnings or other symptoms before or after the event.
Rear Driver Side door latch actuator assembly.  Part failed and door cannot be opened even to change/repair the part.  This is a major safety issue as the door cannot be opened by rear passengers.
Left driver side rear and front headlamps would burn out, after time noticed the left headlamp flickering 9n and off while driving at night in auto mode, also inside dash lights dimming, also left driver side seat will not adjust, this is a Hazzard for myself and others while driving at night, with lights malfunctioning, was pulled over by highway patrol, and given a warning to fix headlamp.Issue has not been inspected by anyone and the vehicle can be inspected upon request, no dash or warning lights have came on.
This fuel pump recall 227 was issued on May 2022 and I've yet to be able to make an appointment to get it fixed. The Hyundai of San Bruno I was finally able to reach said they'll call me back when the parts come in. That was almost a year ago and when you call their service department, you can't even leave a voicemail. On some occasions you can leave a voicemail, but it's never returned. This is a fuel pump hose, not a complicated part. They should have this part. This is unacceptable as this recall addresses a potential fire risk.
MY CAR HAS BEEN DRIVING IN LIMP MODE FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS. I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALERSHIP OVER 8 TIMES FOR THE SAME PROBLEM WHILE IT WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY. THE REPLACED THE KNOCK SENSER TWICE AND IT PASSES THE BEARINGS TEST. MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT BLINKS AND IT HESISTATES WHILE DRIVING. I ONLY HAD THE CAR FOR ONE MONTH SINCE THIS STARTED AND EVERYONE IS GIVING ME THE RUN ARAOUND AND NOT FIXING THE PROBLEM. NOW MY WARRANTY IS EXPIRING BECAUSE I HAVE OVER 100,000 MILES ON IT BUT NOTHING IS FIXED.
From the time of my purchase of the car used in 2016 I noticed the the brake would sometimes make a squeaking sound if the brake pedal was depressed suddenly. In September of 2021 I noticed that a Brake Warning light would come on when starting the car. Sometimes the brake pedal would push to the floor as if there was no brake fluid pressure. I took the car to the Hyundai dealer and asked them to inspect and repair the problem. The problem was determined to be the ABS Pump along with the ABS Assembly. The units were replaced at a cost of $908.91.  Later in June of 2022 the noise returned and the brake light again began to light. I didn't lose brakes but the light remained on whenever the vehicle was operating. I returned to the same dealer service shop and they inspected the problem and found DTC C1236. They checked pressure and it had 1054 Bar (needs to be 1000 Bar).The technician replaced the Hydraulic Electronic Control Unit and installed a Hybrid Noise Fix Kit. The cost for these repairs was $3351.15.  I am aware of problems with other Hyundai model cars brakes. I hope that our car is safe to operate or park.   The dealer confirmed the problems for both repair instances. I do not know if any other authorities have inspected this.  I don't have the defective parts. The dealer service center retained them after both repairs.
The headlights and signal lights go out at least twice a year without warning which happens at night and or when raining. The dealership says they know that's why they keep plenty in stock. I've been dealing with this for 6 years afraid to drive at night or in rain because I never know when they will blow. I'm sure this can be verified by the amount of bulbs being replaced and sold. Help. This has to be a defect. Thank you.
Brake / parking lights on both sides have burned out more than 2 dozen times. This started when the car was less than 2 years old at about 20,000 miles and continues. Reported to dealer several times. Most recently on 4/22/2022. We were told they have no solution to correcting the problem.
While driving home, going about 40-45 mph my dashboard lit up with a check engine, battery, steering and oil lights.  Within a couple miles (2 maybe 3) I lost all power.  All this happened within minutes.  I tried to restart after sitting for 10 minutes, and the engine would not (even try to) turn over.  Ended up using jumper cables to start get car started when the engine started knocking--horribly.  *Likely not available for inspection unless said inspection happens soon.*  My safety was extremely compromised as it all happened within minutes of any dashboard indicators that there was a concern at 6pm.  I was in the midst of driving on a semi-busy road during rush hour.  I barely made it up the hill where I had just enough room to pull off into a *slightly* wider area of the road--this road had no gutters/pull-offs.  The car has not been inspected as of yet.  It will be going to the dealer by COB today (2/25/22).  I was informed it would take at least a few days for them to go over the car.  It has not been inspected by any police or insurance representatives as of this time.
I brought my 2014 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid in for the 964- AUXILIARY CANISTER INSTALLION & 966- ENGINE MONITORING LOGIC Service recall campaigns on 12/08/21. Today, 12/21/21, in heavy traffic on the highway, my car engine abruptly shuts off, immediately decelerating, completely losing any ability to accerate while the engine light, parking break light come on along with an "electric motor warning - safely pull over and do not drive" message on the dashboard. All this happens while a high pitch alarm goes off. All happening simultaneously without warning on the highway with vehicles surrounding us driving 70 mph! This has never happened prior to today and should never happen. How we managed to avoid an accident or worse was a miracle.  This was life threatening and should not be taken lightly!
went to start my car-ignition locked,brakes are locked along with steering wheel.having a tow company to get my car to auto mechanic to  figure out the problem.Worked fine day before-has been parked in driveway for about 13 hours prior,-no messages appeared -this is the first time ever happened.

GLASS FLYING OFF THE ROOF ONTO CARS BEHIND ME. VERY DANGEROUS. I SEE MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. AND YET STILL NO RECALL!!
ENGINE OVER HEATS AND WON'T START FOR SEVERAL HOURS.  IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE ENGINE HAS BEEN RUNNING FOR 5 MINUTES OR AN HOUR OR MORE.  WHEN TURNING THE KEY THE ENGINE CLICKS AND WON'T START.  YOU HAVE TO TURN THE KEY ON SEVERAL TIMES (WHEN THE ENGINE IS COOL) TO HAVE THE ENGINE START RUNNING.  I HAVE READ THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN UNDER RECALL BY HYUNDAI, BUT MY VIN NUMBER IS EXCLUDED ACCORDING TO ONLINE INFORMATION.

FUEL LEAK/ FUEL SMELL / LOSS OF FUEL AFTER FILLING THE TANK TO FULL MARK
I HAVE RECENTLY NOTICED WHILE TRYING TO TURN MY WHEEL OUT OF A PARKED POSITION, THAT IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO MOVE. I PLACE MY KEY IN THE IGNITION AND TRY TO TURN IT ON IT DOES NOT WANT TO TURN UNTIL I GET THE STEERING WHEEL TURNED.  WHEN IT FINALLY DOES AND IT RELEASES THE KEY TO TURN, I BEGAN TO NOTICE THAT WHEN I AM TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL LEFT OR RIGHT IT MAKES A "CLUNKING SOUND".  I AM ALSO BEGINNING TO NOTICE A LIGHT CLUNKING WHILE DRIVING AT A LOWER SEED WHEN I AM TURNING EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT.  IT MAKES ME NERVOUS THAT THE STEERING MIGHT GO OUT WHILE I AM DRIVING AND I WON'T HAVE CONTROL OF THE CAR.  THE CAR IS 5 YEARS OLD AND JUST UNDER 100K.  I HAVE GONE ONLINE TO A FEW HYUNDAI FORUMS AND I AM SEEING MANY, MANY OTHERS WITHT HTE SAME COMPLAINT YET I'M NOT SEEING A RECALL ON THIS.  MY FEAR IS THAT SOMEONE MAY GET TERRIBLY INJURED BEFORE SOMETHING IS DONE.

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE DRIVING 60 MPH, A LOUD NOISE WAS HEARD. THE CONTACT STOPPED THE VEHICLE AND NOTICED THAT THE SUN ROOF HAD SHATTERED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT TAKEN TO A DEALER OR INDEPENDENT MECHANIC FOR DIAGNOSTIC TESTING OR REPAIRS. THE DEALER (FOLSOM LAKE HYUNDAI, 12530 AUTO MALL CIR, FOLSOM, CA 95630, (916) 293-4760) WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 35,000. THE VIN WAS NOT AVAILABLE.
THE CAR WAS TOKEN THE DEALER, WHERE IT WAS BOUGHT, SINCE THEY HAD TOLD US THEY HAD SOME REPAIRING TO DO BUT THE CAR STAYED THE SAME.  THE ENGINE MAKES A VERY UNPLEASANT NOISE, EVERY TIME. WITH THE STEERING WHEEL, WHILE TURNING LEFT, IT SEMI GETS STUCK. IN ORDER FOR THAT TO NOT HAPPEN, YOU BASICALLY HAVE TURN IT RIGHT AWAY. IT IS AT VERY HIGH RISK DUE TO THE FACT THAT IF IT WOULD MANAGE TO GET STUCK, IT MAY CAUSE AN UNNECESSARY ACCIDENT. WHEN IT COMES TO THE WHEELS, EVERY TIME IT TURNS LEFT OR RIGHT IT MAKES A VERY ROCKY NOISE.  WE HAVE CALLED TIME AND TIME FOR A REPARATION OR TO AT LEAST HAVE SOMETHING DONE. NO ONE HAS SEEMED TO REALLY CARE NOR CATCH THEIR ATTENTION.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE DRIVING VARIOUS SPEEDS, THE VEHICLE SHOOK VIOLENTLY. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE SPEEDOMETER FAILED TO INDICATE THE INCREASE IN SPEED WHEN THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WAS DEPRESSED. THERE WERE NO WARNING INDICATORS ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO TUSCALOOSA HYUNDAI (3831 HARGROVE RD E, TUSCALOOSA, AL 35405 (205) 752-8113) WHERE IT WAS INSPECTED AND THE TIRES WERE BALANCED. THE DEALER DIAGNOSED THAT THE MOTOR MOUNT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE VEHICLE WAS THEN TAKEN TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE FRONT BRAKES AND THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE AXLE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE BRAKES WERE REPAIRED, BUT THE AXLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE CONTACT REFERENCED NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 17V226000 (ENGINE AND ENGINE COOLING). THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 63,315.
CAR NOT STARTING.  BRAKE IS HARD NOT ABLE TO PUSH AND STEERING WHEEL LOCKED. HAPPENS INTERMITTENTLY.  CAR LOSES ACCELERATION WHILE DRIVING. ON THE FREEWAY AND CAR LOSES POWER AND SLOWS DRAMATICALLY, THERE IS NO LIGHT ON THE DASH AND THE BRAKE LIGHTS DO NOT COME ON.  WAS ALMOST REAR ENDED ON FREEWAY 3X
THERE IS A STRANGE METALLIC CRACKLING NOISE COMING FROM THE ENGINE DURING ACCELERATION AND SOMETIMES AT CONSTANT SPEED. IT SOUNDS LIKE SMALL LOOSE PIECES OF SCRAP METAL HITTING ONE ANOTHER.
KEY REMAINS STUCK IN IGNITION UNTIL BATTERY IS DISCONNECTED. CAR IS IN PARK STEERING WHEEL IS NOT LOCKED AND CAR IS NOT IN MOTION AND TIRES ARE ALIGNED.
MY VEHICLE HAS FOR THE LAST YEAR SHOWED SIGNS OF THE RECALL AND WE HAVE GOTTEN A HYUNDAI TO FIX IT WITH A RING BUT THE NEXT DAY THE VEHICLE SHOWED THE SAME THINGS.  THE SYMBOL IN THE MIDDLE THAT DISPLAYS DRIVE WHEN IT DISAPPEARS THE CAR STRUGGLES TO ACCELERATE AND DRIVE , AND WHEN I COME TO A COMPLETE STOP WITH IT DISAPPEREARED THE CAR TAKES ALOT OF GAS TO ACCELERATE. WHICH I BELIEVE IS FROM THE TRANSMISSION AND THE CAR NOT BEING ON THE SAME PAGE.. WHICH IS TERRIBLE AS IT CAN COST A LOST OF LIFE DUE TO THE CAR SUDDENLY STOPPING AND IT IS A EXTREME HAZARD TO MYSELF AND MY FAMILY.  AND I WISH THAT HYUNDAI WOULD DO SOMETHING OR REPLACE THE VEHICLE.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE DRIVING AT VARIOUS SPEEDS, THE VEHICLE ACCELERATED INDEPENDENTLY WITHOUT ANY WARNING.

WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY AT ABOUT 60MPH, 100 DEGREES OUTSIDE, A/C ON LOW INSIDE THE CAR (NO A/C VENTS IN THE REAR OF VEHICLE), I HEAR A LOUD POP.  I THOUGHT A TIRE BLEW.  I LOOKED IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR TO SEE THE BACK WINDOW SHATTERED YET STILL IN PLACE AS IT'S SAFETY GLASS.  WITH EACH BUMP IN THE ROAD THE GLASS BEGAN TO FALL INTO THE CAR. MY CAR HAS 5340 MILES ON IT. I HAD NO CHIPS IN THE GLASS. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A TERRIBLE SITUATION HAD I HAD A REAR FACING BABY SEAT IN THE CAR WITH AN INFANT.  OR REAR PASSENGERS OR BEEN SO STARTLED BY THE SITUATION IT CAUSED AN ACCIDENT.  NONE OF THESE THINGS HAPPENED, FORTUNATELY.    *TR
I bought this sonata one month ago. Driving down [XXX] in bonita springs Fla the car shut down. No noise all dash lights came on I got to a safe place. Sat in the parking lot of fresh market for at least 30 minutes went to start it and nothing happened. No crank nothing. AAA came towed it to my house. The filling day I checked the battery it is good. So had it towed to Scotty’s automotive. They called me Friday morning and said the motor was locked up. According to Carfax the car was at brand ton Hyundai in May of 25. I called after I bought the car Carfax said they found the alignment was off. I called to see if they did the alignment they said they did not do it. The wholesale it. My thinking is they did service it according to Carfax report and knew there was signs something and wholesale it. I did not buy it from Brandon Hyundai I bought it from a guy in Leigh acres Fla.  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
The car just stopped while driving.
In 8-2021 the original engine locked up due to a crankshaft bearing lock up. The dealer replaced the entire engine with a rebuilt.  It locked up within 10 seconds after I drove from the dealer due to a massive external oil leak from the engine front area.  The dealer could not determine where the leak was coming from and prepared a report to reflect this.  The dealer then replaced this first replaced engine with another rebuilt engine.  I drove it and within 5 minutes of driving the radiator plastic side tank exploded open and lost coolant. The engine then misfired and began to smoke out the tailpipe. and engine areas.  The dealer demanded I pay $1,100 for a replacement radiator and then they would confirm that the head gasket was leaking from the combustion chamber into the cooling system that exploded the radiator side tank due to overpressurization from exhaust gas.  Another dealer saw that the combustion gas had a large leak that was coming out of the broken radiator plastic side tank  and advised repalcing the engine with another engine and radiator.   The engine locked up while driving it as a result of overheating and/or coolant inside the cylinder that has the head gasket leak.  The dealer and factory refuses to repair the engine that is still under two different kinds of warranties.   The warranties expire on 10-12-2025
I was driving down the street I went to show down by hitting my brakes they wouldn't slow down the vehicle then the car caught fire

The contact stated that after the vehicle was at the dealer for a routine oil change and an engine flush, the following day while driving at approximately 10 MPH in a stop-and-go school zone,  the vehicle stalled and smoke emitted from underneath the hood. All the warning lights on the instrument panel were illuminated. The contact merged to the shoulder of the road and safely exited the vehicle. The vehicle was engulfed in flames. The police department was at the scene and attempted to extinguish the fire. The fire department later arrived and successfully extinguished the fire. The contact mentioned that the flames consumed the vehicle and only the framing was left but it was not determined destroyed yet. The vehicle was towed. A police report was filed. The VIN was included in NHTSA Campaign Number: 21V749000 ( Exterior Lighting, Electrical System) however the vehicle did not receive the recall remedy prior to the failure. A dealer was contacted. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was 161,765.
Check engine light illuminates repeatedly causing the car to go into limp mode (max speed of 30) & at times it stalls while driving. I purchased it on 9/30/23 & check engine warning light has illuminated 20+ since then. I’ve repaired and addressed all of the codes. It also occasionally accelerates abruptly when stopped causing the car in front of me to be hit from behind. In addition to all of the above safety issues, it also has an extremely high oil consumption rate. The engine is faulty and needs to be replaced.
Panoramic Sunroof randomly exploded while i was driving down the street.  Appears to be a known issue and a class action lawsuit has been filed.
The driver's seatbelt does not retract.  The engine is burning oil.
The contact owns a 2015 Hyundai Sonata. The contact stated that two weeks after having the oil changed, the low oil warning light was illuminated on the instrument panel.

The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 110,000.
My car has an anti theft defect that’s making cars like mine easy to be stolen. Over the weekend I took my kids to six flags and my car was stolen. I had my 3 kids with me and my wife. My kids are scared and feels unsafe. If theirs anything you guys can do to help me out, I will appreciate it. I do not have the money to fix my car at the time. I need my car to get back and forth to work.
While driving on a highway, I heard a rattling sound, which could best be described as tying cans to the car and dragging them along the road. I had never heard this noise before. No safety indicator lights turned on to alert me of any issue. With minutes of first hearing the sound, a very loud pop noise could be heard, followed by immediate engine power failure. I was able to navigate off of the highway, into a more residential area. Upon the vehicle coming to a stop on its own (I was not able to apply the brakes at all), a dark cloud of smoke starting coming from underneath the hood. Seconds later, it burst into flames. I was able to safely exit the vehicle with my dog, but if traffic were any heavier, there would have been no safe way for me to get off the road and to a safe location
The engine stopped working completely
The contact owned a 2015 Hyundai Sonata. The contact stated that while driving at various speeds, the vehicle was shaking uncontrollably and stalled. The accelerator pedal was depressed but the vehicle failed to move. The check engine warning light was illuminated. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic and the contact was informed that the failure was due to the engine. The local dealer was not contacted. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was not contacted. The failure mileage was approximately 140,203.

The issue is with the hybrid system, which malfunctioned and apparently ruined the rest of the car. The damaged components are adding up to over 75% of the car's value. The vehicle slowed and stopped suddenly on a busy road when the issue started. Currently, it has been inspected by two different shops and they have both given me the same diagnosis.
My car was a 2015 Hyundai Sonata that was stolen off a well lit street in Milwaukee two days ago. The car was locked with the alarm activated. I feel violated and my safety was at risk and the company knows about the safety issues of these cars and have done nothing about it.
While driving on the interstate, the car began to jerk, and then the engine proceeded to rev as if the car needed a power boost to continue performing. The dashboard then said "Hybrid System Warning! Stop and Do Not Drive" and then the car would no longer accelerate and I had to pull over. This was an extremely dangerous and unsafe situation to be in, and unfortunately, the error only presents itself while driving so the mechanics are unable to get a code that clearly defines the issue that needs to be resolved. I have spent numerous hours on forums with complaints from Hyundai Sonata Hybrid owners who had the same issue and have visited various mechanics to fix the issue, only to end up having the issue arise yet again, further endangering their lives on the road. I believe the best solution forward is to take a serious investigation into the issue and issue an open recall so drivers can get the assistance they need to remain safe on the roads.
The contact called on-behalf of her daughter who owns a 2015 Hyundai Sonata. The contact stated that while her daughter was driving approximately 70 MPH, the vehicle started vibrating abnormally. Additionally, the vehicle inadvertently decelerated to 35 MPH. There were no warning lights illuminated. The driver was able to safely drive the vehicle to the residence. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic and diagnosed with engine failure. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 42,000.
The contact owns a 2015 Hyundai Sonata. The contact stated while driving at 45 MPH and approaching a stop sign, the vehicle started shuddering and stalled. The contact noticed smoke coming out of the hood of the vehicle. There were several unknown warning lights illuminated. The contact was unable to restart the vehicle after several attempts. The contact was able to push the vehicle to the side of the road with the assistance of a bystander.  The vehicle was towed to an independent mechanic who informed the contact to take the vehicle to the dealer for repair. The vehicle was then towed to the dealer where it was diagnosed that the engine had failed and needed to be replaced. The dealer sent a claim with diagnostic report to the manufacturer ; however, the manufacturer declined to cover the repair. The contact followed up with the manufacturer and was informed that they could not assist as  she failed to complete an unknown software update, under Service Campaign Number: 553, designed to report vehicle imbalances  prior to the engine failure. The vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 142,000.
Vehicle started making a front end noise when turning or hitting a bump.
Hyundai reprogramed their Theta engines to prevent an ongoing problem related to Theta engines not receiving oil to the crankshaft and connecting rod bearings.  The software modification was done by an unknown software house.  When I got the first notice, I asked both the local dealer, and the official Hyundai site if this software would cut power, potentially at the wrong time, like going up an entrance ramp.  I got no response and I found out why.  I tried entering a highway where traffic was at 75 mph.  When I got onto the ramp the car was running fine.  Suddenly the power just went away.  I had the gas pedal all the way to the floor and watched the tachometer and speedometer go down rather than up.  I pulled off at the next exit and switched the programming on my transmission to normal from econ mode.  Up the ramp I went, and car started slowing down.  Tried one more time using the sport mode and the power went away.  I'm afraid to try and run on a freeway at rush our because of the lack of power.   I think the needs to be a review of the software and see if changes can be made.
My vehicle started losing oil between oil changes.  Not leaking on the ground.  I looked it up and found out this is a very common issue.  Just my luck.  My vehicle now has major engine issues.  Knocking in the engine, shaking.  I looked it up and to not my surprise, very common.  My vehicle is available for inspection. Safety wise I was traveling 70 on the interstate and the engine just quit and decelerated very quickly with cars driving by fast.  I am getting the vehicle checked inspected Monday 11/29  I had it towed to a garage.  I will also contact the local Hyundai dealer.  No warnings lamps prior to incident
The contact owns a 2015 Hyundai Sonata. The contact stated that while driving at an undisclosed speed, a knocking sound was present coming from the engine before the vehicle stalled. The vehicle was towed to an independent mechanic who diagnosed that the engine had failed. The vehicle was then towed to the local dealer. The failure was not yet repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The failure mileage was 82,455.
I brought car in to see about engine light they told me it was a cvvt and it would cost $1700 which I couldn't afford they stated that because I did not get my oil changed there they could not cover it even though I had prrof of my oil changes from other companies. So took car to mechanic he stated that if I did have cvvt replaced in 6 months time I would have needed a new engine anyway . So he replaced the engine . I have done my homework spoke to numerous people and they have they same issue . How does a 2015 Hyundai with 104000 miles need an engine replaced
I WAS DRIVING TO WORK AT LIKE 4:00 IN THE MORNING IT WAS STILL DARK OUTSIDE THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN AND AS I HIT THE GAS PEDAL THE CAR STALL IT WAS MOVING SLOW SO ON MY RIGHT HAND SIDE THERE WAS A BUILDING SO I TRY TO MAKE IT TO THE PARKING LOT THE CAR STARTED TO POWER DOWN IN A KNOCKING NOISE STARTED IT WAS A BUSY MORNING IN THE MORNING WORK TRAFFIC

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 HYUNDAI SONATA. THE CONTACT STATED WHILE DRIVING AT 70 MPH, THE CHECK ENGINE WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED AND VEHICLE POWER WAS REDUCED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO JOSEPH AIRPORT HYUNDAI LOCATED AT (1220 W NATIONAL RD, VANDALIA, OH 45377) TO BE DIAGNOSED. THE DIAGNOSIS WAS P1326 (MALFUNCTION INDICATOR LAMP) FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED HOWEVER, THE FAILURE RECURRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE BUT OFFERED NO ASSISTANCE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 143,000. THE VIN PROVIDED WAS INCORRECT.
ENGINE KNOCKING, CHECKED THE OIL AND IT WAS FINE. DROVE IT STRAIGHT HOME WHICH WAS ABOUT THREE MILES. THE NEXT DAY I WAS DRIVING IT TO WORK AND THE KNOCKING WAS GETTING LOUDER AND LOUDER, PULLED OVER, CHECKED THE OIL AND IT WAS SLUDGE. TOOK IT TO GREASE MONKEY, WHICH WAS DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM WHERE I WAS. THEY CHANGED THE OIL AND PUT AN ENGINE CLEANER THROUGH IT. STILL THE SAME. THEY TOOK A LOOK AT IT AND SAID THAT THE ENGINE IS SEIZING. I ALWAYS MAINTAINED THE CAR AND NO WARNING LIGHTS EVER CAME ON UNTIL AFTER THE OIL CHANGE, THEN THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. MILEAGE AROUND 113,000 WHEN THIS HAPPENED.
ON OCTOBER 8, 2019, I WAS DRIVING ON HWY 285 IN GEORGIA, WHEN MY HYUNDAI SONATA BEGAN TO REDUCE ITS SPEED DESPITE ME PRESSING THE GAS. AS I ATTEMPTED TO GET TO SAFETY, A WARNING LIGHT FLASHED 'TRANSMISSION HOT..STOP'. THERE WAS NO WARNING OTHER THAN THAT LIGHT THAT POPPED ON AT THAT MOMENT. WHILE DRIVING THROUGH AN INTERSECTION MY CAR COMPLETELY TURNED OFF. I MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO RESTART WITH NO LUCK. THERE WAS NO PRIOR WARNING AND I MAINTAIN REGULARLY OIL CHANGES. I HAD TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED TO A LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP, WHERE I WAS TOLD THAT MY MOTOR/ENGINE NEEDED TO BE COMPLETELY REPAIRED. WHEN I ASKED WHAT THE CAUSE WAS, I WAS INFORMED THAT MY 3RD PISTON HAD EXPLODED AND DAMAGED THE MOTOR TO THE POINT OF NEEDING REPLACEMENT. THE MECHANIC STATED THAT IT WAS NOT KNOW WHY THIS OCCURRED. I WAS ALSO INSTRUCTED THAT THE MANUFACTURER WAS NO LONGER MAKING THE MOTOR THAT I HAVE IN MY CAR AND I WOULD NOT TO PURCHASE A USED ONE. THIS WOULD COST ME APPROXIMATELY $5000 AT THE LEAST. I HAVE ONLY HAD THIS CAR FOR LESS THAN TWO YEARS AND REQUIRING A NEW MOTOR IS UNBELIEVABLE. THE MECHANIC SHARED THAT I WAS LUCKY THAT THE CAR DID NOT CATCH ON FIRE WHILE I WAS DRIVING IT.
I PURCHASED MY 2015 HYUNDAI SONATA RECENTLY WITH ONLY 46K MILES ON IT.  AFTER 3 WEEKS, THE ENGINE STARTED CLICKING LOUDLY AND IT LITERALLY SOUNDED LIKE A ROLLER COASTER BEING PULLED UPHILL WHEN UNDER LOAD.  A WEEK LATER THE TICKING WAS CONSTANT.  MY HUSBAND CHANGED MY OIL AND STRAINED IT, FINDING SMALL METAL FRAGMENTS IN THE OIL.  THESE FRAGMENTS ARE FROM AN ENGINE DEFECT THAT HYUNDAI EVEN ADMITS HAVING.  NOW AS THE SECOND OWNER, I HAVE NO SERVICE RECORDS PRIOR TO OWNERSHIP AND MY WARRANTY CLAIM WAS DENIED BECAUSE OF IT.  HOW CAN THIS BE HAPPENING?  HYUNDAI ADMITS DEFECT BUT ARE STILL ALLOWED TO RIP OFF CONSUMERS WITH BAD ENGINES?  THE GDI HYUNDAI ENGINES ARE DEFECTIVE AND IT COST ME $3,000!
VEHICLE SHUDDERS AND SHAKES AND LOSES POWER (WITHOUT COMPLETELY STALLING) WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A COMPLETE STOP SUCH AS PULLING OUT OF A DRIVEWAY OR AT AN INTERSECTION.   DEALER RESET THE COMPUTER AND IT HELPED FOR A FEW HOURS, THEN STARTED ACTING UP AGAIN.
I WAS IN MOTION (JUST COMING OUT OF A STEEP CANYON ON AN INTERSTATE/HIGHWAY) AND SUDDENLY THE ENGINE JUST STOPPED. THE CHECK OIL, CHECK ENGINE, AND CHECK BATTERY LIGHTS FLASHED BECAUSE MY IGNITION WAS STILL ON, BUT I HAD TO TRY TO COAST TO A SAFE STOP. NO WARNING, NO OVERHEATING, NO ISSUES WITH BATTERY OR OIL OR OTHER FLUIDS. THE ENGINE JUST SQUEAKS FAINTLY WHEN I TURN THE KEY AND WON'T TURN OVER.
ENGINE HAS APPROXIMATELY 60,000 MILES AND BURNS BETWEEN HALF TO ONE QUART OF OIL EVERY 1,000 MILES.  HYUNDAI DEALER PERFORMED AN "OIL CONSUMPTION TEST" WHERE THEY RECORDED OIL LEVEL AFTER 1,000 MILES THREE TIMES.  AFTER THE FIRST 1K MILES IT WAS DOWN ABOUT HALF A QUART OF OIL, SAME ON SECOND 1K MILES, AND ABOUT 1 QUART ON THIRD 1K MILES.  HYUNDAI ADVISED THIS IS NORMAL OIL CONSUMPTION AND WOULD NOT INVESTIGATE FURTHER UNLESS AVERAGE USE WAS MORE THAN 1 QUART AFTER 1K MILES.    THE SUGGESTED OIL CHANGE INTERVAL FROM HYUNDAI IS 7,500 MILES.  AT THE RATE OF OIL CONSUMPTION THE VEHICLE WOULD BE OUT OF OIL BEFORE THE RECOMMENDED SERVICE INTERVAL FOR OIL CHANGES.
THE GAS TANK LEVER GOES DOWN AS IF I WERE SIPPING ON THE GASOLINE.  THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE I PURCHASED THE USED VEHICLE AROUND JUNE OR JULY 2018
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE DRIVING AT AN UNKNOWN SPEED ON THE HIGHWAY, THE ENGINE SEIZED AND THE CHECK ENGINE AND OIL WARNING INDICATORS ILLUMINATED. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NO LONGER OPERABLE. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED BACK TO THE CONTACT'S RESIDENCE. THE DEALER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 58,000.
WITH ONLY 27,000 MILES, THE CAR STALLED AT AN INTERSECTION WITHOUT ANY WARNING ON A JUNE DAY IN 2016 IN TEXAS.  TOWED TO DEALERSHIP FOR WARRANTY REPAIR.  WARRANTY COMPANY DECLINED THE REPAIR, CLAIMING "CUSTOMER MAINTENANCE ISSUE".  WARRANTY COMPANY REFUSED REPAIR AFTER LOOKING ONLY AT PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE ENGINE.  WARRANTY COMPANY DIDN'T REQUEST, AND DEALERSHIP REFUSED TO EVEN ACCEPT OWNERS MAINTENANCE RECORDS.      AFTER THE REPAIR WAS DECLINED, I RESEARCHED THE PROBLEM AND FOUND OUT ABOUT RECALL FOR PREVIOUS MODEL YEARS 2011-2014.  THAT RECALL WAS A RESPONSE TO SIMILAR FAILURES AND CUSTOMER'S SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ABOUT WARRANTY COMPANY AUTOMATICALLY CLAIMING "CUSTOMER MAINTENANCE ISSUE".    DEALERSHIP SHARED WITH ME THEIR COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE WARRANTY COMPANY WHICH ASKED ONLY FOR PHOTOS OF THE PROBLEM.  HOW CAN THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE BE DETERMINED BY PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE ENGINE WHEN THE PREVIOUS FOUR MODEL YEARS USED THE SAME EXACT ENGINE MODEL RESULTING IN MAJOR RECALLS?  ALSO, HOW CAN THE WARRANTY COMPANY REFUSE TO SEE MAINTENANCE RECORDS AND THEN BLAME OWNER'S FOR THE FAILURE?    CLEARLY THE COMPANY IS EXECUTING A NATIONWIDE POLICY OF DECLINING REPAIRS EVEN WHEN THEY ARE COVERED BY THE WARRANTY.  HOW MANY SIMILAR FAILURES WERE COVERED BY THE WARRANTY?
I BOUGHT THE CAR IN 2015, CURRENTLY THE CAR HAS LESS THAN 14,000 MILES. WITHIN THIS 3 YEAR AND  LOW MILEAGE I HAD EXPERIENCE SEVERAL PROBLEMS  1.- TIRES BREAKS EASILY  2.- ELECTRICAL WIRES INSULATOR HAS BEEN APPLIED WITH VEGETABLES SOLUTION, MAKING FATAL ATTRACTION TO RODENTS      3.- BATTERY DOESN'T LAST OVER 12,000 MILES  4.- SEAT BELTS ARE DEFECTIVES, AND STILL IS  5.- BETWEEN THE TRANSMISSION AND THE TRANSFER CASE THE IS A DRAGGING NOISE  6.- TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE? EXPENSIVE AND MALFUNCTION MAKING THIS SAFETY ISSUE DANGEROUS.  7.- RADIO......PART OF THE TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE STOP WORKING IF YOU STOP HYUNDAI SO CALLED BLUE LINK SERVICE  8.- SCREEN AT MY DASHBOARD WENT BLANK 3 TIMES AT 3,000.  7,000 AND 11,000 MILES  9.- WHILE DRIVING MY VEHICLE ENGINE SHUT OFF AT STOP LIGHT (THANKS GOD IT HAPPENS WHEN I WAS DRIVING LOCALLY)  ALL THIS HAPPENS WITHIN THIS 3 YEARS THAT I OWN THE CAR
MY WIFE BELIEVES OUR CAR HAD A "SUDDEN UNINTENDED ACCELERATION" THAT CAUSED THE CAR TO LURCH FORWARD AT A HIGH SPEED AND REAR END THE CAR PARKED IN FRONT OF HER. SHE KINDLY SUGGESTS THAT EMPLOYEE TAKE THE TIME TO RESEARCH THIS ON THE INTERNET. USE GOOGLE AND TYPE IN HYUNDAI SUDDEN UNINTENDED ACCELERATION. YOU WILL SEE STORIES FROM NUMEROUS HYUNDAI CAR OWNERS WHO SAY THEY HAVE HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM HAPPEN.    THIS PROBLEM IS VERY DANGEROUS AND I FEAR FOR MY WIFE'S SAFETY WHEN SHE CONTINUES TO DRIVE OUR HYUNDAI. I KNOW WE HAVE NO PROOF OF THIS HAPPENING UNLESS HYUNDAI MOTOR CORP. "OWNS UP" TO THE PROBLEM. BUT MY WIFE IS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT OUR CAR SUDDENLY UNINTENDED ACCELERATED FORWARD CAUSING THE REAR END COLLISION. SHE WAS ATTEMPTING TO PARK HER CAR ON A STREET.  MY WIFE IS A VERY SAFE AND CAREFUL DRIVER. SHE HAS BEEN DRIVING   FOR 30 YEARS WITHOUT HAVING AN ACCIDENT, UNTIL RECENTLY. SHE TRULY  BELIEVES THE ACCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY THE SUA AND SHE WAS NOT AT FAULT.
ENGINE PERFORMANCE WAS REDUCED; A KNOCKING SOUND COULD BE HEARD FROM THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ENGINE; WITHIN A FEW DAYS THE ENGINE STALLED WHILE DRIVING AND WOULD NOT RESTART. HYUNDAI DEALER INSPECTION INDICATES THE ENGINE IS SEIZED UP. SYMPTOMS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN ENGINE-RECALLED HYUNDAI SONATAS FROM THE PREVIOUS MODEL YEAR. HYUNDAI DECLINES TO PAY TO REPLACE THE ENGINE, BUT I SUSPECT THIS IS THE SAME PROBLEM AS OCCURRED IN PREVIOUS MODEL YEAR, FOR WHICH HYUNDAI IS REPLACING ENGINES.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 HYUNDAI SONATA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING, HE HEARD A RATTLING NOISE UNDER THE HOOD.

THE TIRE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE TIRE WAS REPLACED AT THE OWNER'S EXPENSE. THE DOT NUMBER WAS UNKNOWN. THE APPROXIMATE TIRE AND VEHICLE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 16,000.
MY 2015 HYUNDAI SONATA LIMITED SPORT 2.0 HAS A DEFECTIVE GLASS ROOF.  THE GLASS PANEL WAS VERY LOOSE UPON DELIVERY OF VEHICLE AND MADE NOISE 100% DURING DRIVING.  MY LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALER HAD A 3RD PARTY VENDOR ATTEMPT A REPAIR.  THE NOISE WENT AWAY BUT NOW THE GLASS PANELS DON'T FIT ANYMORE AND THE TRIM AROUND THE GLASS IS FAILING.  *TR
I WAS DRIVING ABOUT AT 50 MPH ON A HIGHWAY WITH MY KIDS AND HAD ONLY 1 TO 2 MILES LEFT TO EXIT. SUDDENLY, I FELT SOMETHING WRONG IN THE ENGINE OR POWERTRAIN AS I COULDN'T ACCELERATE MY CAR. WHEN I TRIED TO HIT HARD ON THE ACCELERATION PEDAL, MY CAR WOULD ACCELERATE A LITTLE BIT, BUT NOT THAT MUCH. WHILE I STEPPED DOWN ON THE PEDAL, I FELT MY CAR WAS ROLLING UP AND DOWN. ANYWAY, MY SPEED WAS BEING REDUCED AS IT DIDN'T ACCELERATE. FINALLY, I EXITED THE HIGHWAY. I HAD TO STOP AT THE INTERSECTION AND THEN TRIED TO START, BUT MY CAR MOVED VERY SLOWLY AND HARD WITH THE ROLLING. IT IS ONLY 1-MILE DISTANCE TO MY HOME FROM THE INTERSECTION, BUT I HAD TO PULL OVER MY CAR TO A SHOULDER AS I FOUND THAT I COULDN'T NO LONGER DRIVE MY CAR WITHOUT INTERRUPTING THE TRAFFIC. I ALSO COULD SEE WHITE/BLACK SMOKE COMING OUT FROM MY CAR THROUGH MY ROOM MIRROR AND SMELL SOMETHING BURNT IN THE ENGINE ROOM. LASTLY, I HAD TO CALL A TOWING COMPANY FOR PICK-UP.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE DRIVING 65 MPH, THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO LOSE POWER AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO DECREASE IN SPEED WHEN THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WAS DEPRESSED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO A DEALER WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE TURBO FAILED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 30,000. THE VIN WAS NOT AVAILABLE.
THE STEERING WHEEL ON THIS CAR WILL LOCK OR GET STUCK AS I AM OPERATING THE VEHICLE.  IT HAS HAPPENED AT SLOW SPEEDS AS WELL AS HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND EVEN HAPPENED IN REVERSE ONCE.  IT IS INTERMITTENT AND RANDOM BUT THE FREQUENCY IS INCREASING.  ON MY FIRST DEALER VISIT 12/10/15 THERE WAS A CODE FOR THE ELECTRONIC STEERING WHICH THE DEALER CLEARED AND RETURNED THE CAR TO ME WITHOUT MAKING ANY REPAIRS.  THE PROBLEM CONTINUED SO THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO A 2ND DEALER WHO FOUND A CODE PERTAINING TO ECM OVERHEATING.  HYUNDAI ADVISED THE DEALER TO CLEAR THE CODE AND RETURN THE CAR TO ME.  I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH HYUNDAI CUSTOMER CARE ON 12/16/15 AND RECEIVED AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT EMAIL THAT A REPRESENTATIVE WOULD CONTACT ME IN 3-5 DAYS. ON 12/21 I CONTACTED HYUNDAI CUSTOMER CARE, EXPLAINED THE CAR WASNT SAFE TO DRIVE SO WHAT SHOULD I DO.  I WAS TOLD HYUNDAI WOULD NOT OFFER A LOANER CAR BUT I COULD ASK MY DEALER IF THEY WOULD PROVIDE ONE AT THEIR COST.  I ASKED ABOUT A REPRESENTATIVE CONTACTING ME AND I WAS TOLD IT HASNT BEEN 5 DAYS YET SO I NEEDED TO BE PATIENT.  AS OF 12/30/15 I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED A RESPONSE FROM HYUNDAI CUSTOMER CARE.  *JS
WHEN IN DRIVE, AT LOW SPEEDS (BETWEEN 5MPH AND 10MPH) THE VEHICLE BECOMES JERKY WHEN DECELERATING, VEHICLE SHUDDERS AS IF TROUBLING TO CHANGE GEARS.
THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF FILING THIS REPORT IS TO PREVENT A CHILD FROM DYING IN A LOCKED TRUNK.  AS I PACKED MY RENTAL CAR FOR A TRIP I STUPIDLY LOCKED MY KEYS IN THE TRUNK OF THE CAR.  AN UNLOCKING SERVICE CAME AND POPPED  MY DOOR LOCK BUT BECAUSE THE ALARM SYSTEM WAS ON THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO ACCESS TO THE TRUCK AT ALL.  THIS MODEL HAS DROP DOWN SEATS BUT ARE LOCKED FROM IN THE TRUNK.  IT TOOK A COUPLE OF HOURS FOR SOMEONE TO CORRECTLY TELL ME TO OPEN THE TRUNK I HAD TO VISIT A HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP FOR A KEY....NO OTHER WAY TO ENTER THE TRUNK.   I OFTEN DRIVE ACROSS THE DESERT...NO DEALERSHIP AND NO UNLOCKING SERVICES.  IF MY GRANDSON HAD PLAYED IN THE TRUNK AND LOCKED HIMSELF IN HE WOULD HAVE DIED OF HEAT EXPOSURE BEFORE IT COULD HAVE BEEN UNLOCKED.  THIS IS UNNECESSARY.  THERE ARE RELEASE LEVERS IN THE TRUNK BUT A YOUNG CHILD WOULD BE UNABLE TO PULL THEM.  THIS IS A TRAGEDY WAITING TO HAPPEN.  I WAS SAVED ONLY BY THE FACT I WAS IN A VERY LARGE CITY.  *TR
Driving and engine began to tick, for a couple minutes, then died. Would not restart.

What component or system failed or malfunctioned, and is it available for inspection upon request? Engine  How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk? I was driving 60 mph down a busy highway when I lost the ability to accelerate—putting myself and others at risk while trying to get off the road to a safe location.  Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? Yes.  Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives, or others? Yes. A mechanic that has been in our area for decades. Were there any warning lamps, messages, or other symptoms of the problem before the failure, and when did they first appear? No.
Car has been meticulously maintained with the best oil and premium gasoline.  The car is only used on the freeway at 60-70 mph.  Husband was on his way home and engine light came on.  Car started shaking horribly.  He had put a fuel injector cleaner in his recent full tank the day before.  Drove car to auto zone.  Got the code for misfire on cylinder 3.  Replaced all spark plugs.  Still code.  Replaced cylinder 3 coil.  Still code.  Swapped cylinder 2 coil with 3.  Code still on 3.  Took it to shop thinking fuel injectors.  Car has no compression on cylinder 3.  Needs engine.  Hyundai has somehow gotten away with not having to replace engines unless they through a rod.  This car has the knock update on it.  A lot of others are in the same boat as me.  Hyundai should be held accountable for faulty engines.  It’s not safe to drive an engine with a bad cylinder that shakes violently.
I'm making a complaint on my 2016 Hyundai Sonata’s engine.  The problem started in February 2023 with the valve cover gasket leaking, the mileage was around 98,000 miles.  Then, 2 months later, the oil pan was leaking.  The vehicle was still losing oil.  They can not find where the oil went to.  Took the car to the dealer to do an oil pressure.  Before the oil pressure, oil levels were down 1 ⅔ quart  low.  Drove the vehicle for 1,000 miles and checked and the oil was down ¾ quart low, which was in range according to Hydundia.  Checking the oil level every 1,000 miles and the oil level were about 1 quart oil low.  Since last year, checking the oil level every 1,000 miles until this month the oil level was 3 quarts low at 1,000 miles.  This engine should be recalled, which I had found out several different ones I came across are having the same problem.
I have a 2016 Hyundai Sonata that I purchased in 2021. The engine began "knocking" at 142,000 miles so I took it to dealership as it looked to be the same issue many of the Hyundais have been experiencing. I was then informed my claim was denied because a Service Campain from 2018 had not been performed. This is a known issue with these vehicles but my claim was denied over something outside of my control.
Engine began misfiring, spark plug coated in oil which indicates piston ring defect. I get regular scheduled maintenance, often needing oil far before maintenance would be due. This is a KNOWN issue and Hyundai is NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY.
Yesterday while driving my vehicle engine stalled and wouldn't go over 40 MPH, about 10 seconds later the engine would not go over 15 MPH.
Engine is constantly burning through oil. I would get my oil checked 4 times more just to make sure I had oil and even then it would burn empty. I did not have a leak. This cause my engine to blow. This was unsafe as I could have been driving when this occurred. This is being confirmed by a certified Hyundai mechanic. No warning. Other Hyundai cars have a recall for this SAME engine issue but not my model and make
The headlight setting changes on its own, it will change when using the blinker or it'll just change on its own. By change I mean the headlights turn off. Even if it's set to auto, they still go completely off. My bulbs don't need to be replaced.  It's been happening for a few months now. I can't recall a specific date
Car is consuming an increased amount of oil. PVC valve replaced. 5 quarts of oil after oil change is only lasting about 2.5k miles with oil on dipstick being barely readable requiring 4 quarts to get oil in middle of normal range for vehicle.
Engine burning too much oil, about 1/2 quart per month. Dealership said that there was a recall for the engine to be replaced but I must wait until my engine dies.  I understand that we may be stranded if we take a long trip.  Being the 2nd owner of this car, we never received the letter/notice of the recall.  My husband is trying to talk to the Hyundai customer service rep in California to try to get permission to have the engine replaced sooner so that we can stop the over-burning of oil and not be stranded on the road.  So far the rep is 5 days past due in calling us back.  Can you help us? The car is available for inspection upon request.  There were no warning lights indicating a problem only the soot accumlating in the tail pipe.  Mu husband also observed blue smoke coming from the tail pipe when I was driving the car and he was following me in his car.
Since the previous recall associated with the turn signal sometimes signaling in the wrong direction, I have noticed for months that when driving at night when the turn signal is on in either direction the lights function will start moving from on to auto to off causing the lights to turn off when signaling. This is very dangerous especially at night.
The contact owns a 2016 Hyundai Sonata. The contact stated four days after purchasing the vehicle, he needed to add oil to the engine. The contact stated that the low oil pressure warning light was illuminated. The contact took the vehicle to the local dealer, where it was diagnosed with needing an oil consumption test performed. The contact stated after 1,000 miles the vehicle was taken back to the dealer and the contact was informed that oil needed to be added to the engine. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer had not been informed of the failure. The failure mileage was 67,156.
The vehicle is able to be started without a key by using a usb cable. This makes the vehicle extremely vulnerable to theft. Because of this issue vehicles incur other damages due to theft such as broken windows and possibly bodily injury due to theft.   They are able to remove the steering column cover, unplug the ignition switch and using a usb cable as an object to turn the ignition.   Because the switch appears to be plug and play it makes it easy to steal cause Hyundai car owners unnecessary dollars for repairs.   https://youtu.be/fbTrLyqL_nw  This is the link showing what they do. It’s not just Kia vehicles.  My vehicle was stolen the same way.
Vehicle has excessive oil consumption.   Has been an issue for some time now.    Same engine is under recall for the rods/valves malfunction.  vehicle has had regular maintenance done.   there is no aftermarket work done to the engine.   Vehicle has been to the dealer for this issue 3 separate times now and the issue is progressively getting worse.
Somehow, either by design or manufacturing defect, a part in the headlamp assembly melts and causes a gap in the illumination of the lights while driving. Technicians have said that this is a progressive issue, rather than some sudden onset, and multiple people have said they've never experienced this before but are having this issue with the Hyundai Sonata.
I went to my mechanic today to see why my car was making rattling noises coming from the steering wheel.  It's been happening randomly for about a year now or more now. The mechanic said he's seen this over a thousand times with Hyundai, and I need to bring it into Hyundai to fix because something is wrong with the "Steering Rack Support Yoke", which is making the noise. If this is happening to so many Hyundai's this should be fixed for free and recalled! He googled it and gave me a whole printout from Hyundai. It says  2011 to 2018 model year Sonata  2011 to 2018 model year Sonata Hybrid  2012 to 2017 model year Azera  2013 to 2018 model year Santa Fe.  This is what my mechanic gave me and said all these cars are affected. So why isn't this recalled, it is dangerous because eventually you could loose control of the steering wheel I think and it's going to cost a lot to fix.  Thanks
The contact owns a 2016 Hyundai Sonata. The contact stated while driving 70 MPH, the vehicle lost motive power and stalled without warning. The contact was able to pull over safely; upon inspection, the contact noticed that there was oil leaking from under the front of the vehicle. The vehicle was towed by AAA to an independent mechanic to be diagnosed. The contact was informed that there was a hole in the engine block and the engine needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 33,000.
Took car to accredited service center for routine oil change early. Was given an opinion that the their was internal engine damage and that my engine would blow out if car was continued to be driven. I then had it towed to Hyundai dealership to be serviced and to get a second opinion. Service was done, and told it was a simple issue, after paying $400 after services were complete, I left feeling relieved it wasn’t a bigger issue. Not less than maybe 6 hours later, early sunday morning, I was driving at night on the road and my engine completely blew out on me. My safety was put at risk and others around me on the road as well because I could have caused an accident, if I had been on the high-way going a higher MPH, my engine would have more than likely caught on fire or possibly have caused an accident. Clearly the issue was not fixed and they sent me to drive in a car that was faulty and not fixed, endangering my life and possibly others around me. It has only been inspected by hyundai, but clearly inspection by them is inadequate. No engine light warnings ever appeared. Oil light would occasionally flash on and off but I didn’t think anything of it because, 1) no loud sounds/vibrations were happening, 2) my next oil change service wasn’t until almost over 1,000 miles, as I regularly keep up with maintenance on my vehicle. I would say the on and off oil light was flashing maybe for about a week or so, and this was NOT after prior oil change, this occurred miles and miles after.  I have attach pictures from the 1st opinion service, as well as the service I received from Hyundai before incident occured. I have also if needed to be provided, documentation of routine maintenance by Hyundai Dealership and from an accredited service center by the Better Business of Bureau.
The contact owns a 2016 Hyundai Sonata. The contact stated that while driving at an undisclosed speed, there was a knocking sound, and the vehicle lost motive power. Additionally, the vehicle consumed an excessive amount of oil, and there was a smoke odor detected. The check engine, oil, and two other unknown warning lights were illuminated. The vehicle was taken to the dealer on three separate occasions; however, the dealer could not duplicate the failure. The vehicle was then towed to an independent mechanic and diagnosed with engine failure. The vehicle was not repaired and will be towed back to the dealer. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure and informed the contact that they would call back. The failure mileage was unknown.
I was driving on the highway 11/30/2021 when my engine light came on and the vehicle was shaking uncontrollably and I couldn’t accelerate much. I pulled over and called a relative to trail me to a local Firestone. I assumed it was spark plugs but they tested it and it was a code p 304 cylinder 4 misfire. My car is currently at a mechanic shop named forest hill garage in Montgomery Alabama they called me 12/8/2021 and told me it’s a cylinder 4 misfire and it costs around $5,000 to fix and replace. He also stated there’s 7 other vehicles the same type of Hyundai up there with the same exact issue!!! Something is definitely wrong and needs to be recalled. I haven’t gotten the other documentation as of 12/08/2021 because I am at work
2016 HYUNDAI SONATA. CONSUMER WRITES IN REGARDS TO PAINT PEELING OFF VEHICLE.
*The engine is the component with the issue.  The car is at the dealership and has been for the past almost 6 weeks. *The car started "stuttering" or "stalling"  while my son and I were in the car.  My son has special needs.  Luckily, it happened on our street and I was able to get back to my home. *The dealership has identified the problem:  The car was 3 quarts low on oil and the oil had been leaking into the spark plugs.  The car only has around 32500 miles on it.  Hyundai has requested an oil consumption test.  This requires me to drive it 1000 miles and have oil checked.  They want me to do this 3 times!  I will not feel safe doing that, knowing that oil is leaking into the spark plug assembly.  I transport my special needs son and another young man who is severely autistic.  I cannot take the chance of the car stalling while out driving possibly causing an accident. I barely put 50 miles on my car during a week.  It will take me forever to do the oil consumption test.  They know oil is leaking into the spark plugs. *The car started having issues (while in reverse) a week before the check engine light came on.  No other warning lamps or messages appeared. Blue Link was contacted. They said the error code indicated a Powertrain problem.  I had to have the car towed.
KNOCKING NOISE, ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON, OIL IN WHERE SPARK PLUG IS, LEAKS OILS AND RUNS OUT WAY BEFORE NEXT OIL CHANGE. CAR IN MOTION, STARTS TO IDLE WEIRD AND THEN CAR SHUTS OFF.

ON FRIDAY NIGHT, OCTOBER 23, 2020, I WAS DRIVING EAST ON E. MAIN STREET IN MESA, AZ HEADED TO THE RED MOUNTAIN 202 FREEWAY. THE LIGHT WAS GREEN AS I APPROACHED THE INTERSECTION AND I MADE A RIGHT TURN ONTO THE FREEWAY FRONTAGE ROAD TO HEAD SOUTHBOUND.  I WAS DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 25 MPH AS MY CAR'S STEERING BECAME RIGID AND FELT LIKE MY POWER STEERING HAD GONE OUT. I COULD BARELY COMPLETE THE RIGHT TURN CAUSING MY CAR TO CAREEN INTO THE CONCRETE SIDE BARRIER CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE FRONT DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE VEHICLE. MANY OF THE DASHBOARD LIGHTS WERE ON WITH MANY DIFFERENT ALERTS AS I PULLED OVER WITH MY PASSENGER. WE PULLED OVER IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE COLLISION TO ASSESS THE DAMAGES AND OUR WELL BEING FOR A FEW MINUTES.  I THEN PROCEEDED TO DRIVE TO MY PLACE OF WORK A FEW MILES AWAY AND PARK THE CAR SO I COULD CONTACT THE DEALERSHIP WHO HAD WORKED ON MY CAR THREE DAYS PRIOR. THE NEXT MORNING, OCTOBER 24, 2020, I CALLED THE HORNE HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP AND LEFT A MESSAGE AT THE SWITCHBOARD FOR A SERVICE MANAGER TO CALL ME.  I INFORMED HER THAT I HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT.  ON MONDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 26, 2020 I DROVE THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP TO BE INSPECTED.  ON WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 2020, I WAS INFORMED BY MATT COLTON, SERVICE MANAGER FROM HORNE HYUNDAI, THAT IT WAS NOT THEIR ISSUE AND THAT I 'NEEDED TO TURN IT INTO MY INSURANCE.' AS A RESULT, I HAVE NOT DRIVEN MY UNREPAIRED CAR, IT IS SECURELY PARKED AT MY PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT AS TO PRESERVE IT FOR INSPECTION.
NUMEROUS POSTS AND THIS HAS OCCURRED TO ME NUMEROUS TIMES WITHIN THE PAST 2 MONTHS. AFTER DRIVING VEHICLE ON THE FREEWAY, AND GETTING OFF TO GET GAS OR STOP TO GET GROCERIES OR ANYTHING, WHEN THE VEHICLE IS TURNED OFF, CHECK HYBRID SYSTEM LIGHT COMES ON AND VEHICLE IS DISABLED. WILL NOT START OR ATTEMPT TO START FOR AT LEAST 20 MINUTES. WHEN VEHICLE STARTS BACK UP THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AND STAYS ON UNTIL THE VEHICLE IS TURNED OFF AGAIN THEN THE CEL GOES AWAY. SOUNDS LIKE NUMEROUS PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS ISSUE, I HOWEVER HAVE BEEN LUCKY THAT IT HASN'T SHUT OFF WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY, SOUNDS LIKE MANY OTHER PEOPLE IT HAS. THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL OR THE CAR BE LABELED AS LEMON OR SOMETHING.
MY CAR HAS SLOWLY BEEN CONSUMING MORE AND MORE OIL AS ITS LIFE GOES ON. I CURRENTLY HAVE 80,000 MILES ON IT AND I CAN'T EVEN GO A WHOLE 3,000 MILES WITHOUT AN OIL CHANGE OR ADDING MORE OIL BECAUSE IT GOES THROUGH IT ALL. SOMETHING NEEDS DONE ABOUT IT AS THIS IS NOT NORMAL FOR A CAR.
IT BURNS THROUGH ABOUT 2.5 QUARTS OF OIL EVERY OIL CHANGE AND HYUNDAI SAYS THAT NORMAL... THAT'S FAR FROM NORMAL.
ON SEPTEMBER 1,2019 MY CAR WOULDNT START. I PURCHASED A BATTERY AND A IT TURNED OVER. ON SEPTEMBER 8TH I DROVE TO GET A OIL CHANGE AND TUNE UP WHICH SEEMED ABNORMAL WHEN I GOT HOME. THERE WAS A TICKING NOISE. I WASNT SURE WHAT WAS CAUSING THE TICKING NOISE SO I DIDNT DRIVE THE CAR. ON SEPTEMBER   9TH I GOT INTO CAR AND STARTED IT WHEN I NOTICED A KNOCKING NOISE, THE NOISE ACCELERATED ONCE I PRESSED ON GAS PEDAL SO I DIDNT WANT TO DRIVE IT. MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS RAPIDLY BLINKING.
CAR LOSES POWER WHILE DRIVING. THIS INCIDENT HAS HAPPENED 3 SEPARATE TIMES SINCE PURCHASING THIS VEHICLE. IT IS UNSAFE, AND NO ENGINE INDICATOR LIGHTS HAVE EVER COME ON. THE CAR CONTINUES TO HAVE MOTOR ISSUES NOW THAT IT IS OUT OF HYUNDAI'S WARRANTY. HYUNDAI HAS NEVER FOUND A CLEAR SOLUTION AND CONTINUES TO "GUESS" AT FIXES AS ISSUE DOESN'T ALWAYS REPLICATE ITSELF DURING SERVICE.     EVENT HAS HAPPENED 3 DIFFERENT DATES
I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AND HEARD A GUNSHOT SOUND THEN GLASS STARTED FALLING. MY SUNROOF EXPLODED. HYUNDAI IS TRYING ALL THEY COULD TO NOT COVER THE ISSUE
ON  OCTOBER 26TH MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING MYSELF AND OUR 2 CHILDREN WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN WE WENT FROM GOING 45 MILES AN HOUR TO STOPPING AND THEN EVEN AFTER THE GAS PEDAL WAS PUSHED ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR WE WE WERE GOING APPROX 5 MILES AM HOUR. OUR ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND AFTET APPROX 5 TO 10 MIN WE FOUND A PLACE TO PULL OVER AS THERE WERE NO PULLOFFS READILY AVAILABLE. AFTET WE PULLED OFF THE ROAD WE SHUT THE CAR OFF FOR A FEW MINUTES AND RESTARTED THE CAR AND WERE ABLE TO MAKE IT HOME . THE ENGINE LIGJT WAS STILL ON BUT POWER AND SPEED WERE RESTORED. WE CALLED OUR HYUNDAI DEALER ON FRI MORNING AND THEY SAID TO BRING IT DOWN ON MONDAY. THE CAR SAT ALL WEEKEND AND WAS NOT DRIVEN DUE RO FEAR OF IT HAPPENING AGAIN. I DID HOWEVER START THE CAR ON FRIDAY AND ENGINE LIGHT WAS STILL ON. WE BROUGHT THE CAR DOWN MON AT 9AM. THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS NOW OFF BUT THE HYUNDAI MECHANIC SAID EVEN IF THE LIGHT WAS OFF A CODE WOULD STILL BE IN THE SYSTEM. WE RECEIVED A CALL AROUND 3PM SAYING THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG  BUT EVEN THEY DID NOT UNDER WHY NO CODE AT ALL SHOWED UP. THEY ARE KEEPING THE CAR UNTIL FRIDAY TO KEEP STARYING AND DRIVING IT TO SEE IF SOMETHING HAPPENS. MU HUSBAND DID REPORT THE ISSUE TO HYUNDAI AND THEY SAID THEY WILL INVESTIGATE. IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN AGAIN WITH SOMEONE DRIVING BEHIND US IT COULD BE A VERY SERIOUS ACCIDENT. VERY NERVOUS AND SCARED SOMETHING CAN HAPPEN ESPECIALLY DRIVING MY YOUND CHILDREN AROUND.

I have recently acquired this vehicle. There has been zero unrecorded recalls, and I have been told that there is an active recall on the engine in this vehicle. I am inquiring this. The car has recently been taken to my mechanic and he has told me this plus the car engine is using a excessive amount of oil. I have heard that it is possible to have the engine replaced due to the recall I am inquiring about that. On the date of the incident that has occurred. I am putting the date of the purchase of the vehicle order that is on the Pohanka buyers order.
My car was recalled because of the paint chipping. I had it fixed however it is still chipping in more spots. I'd like it fixed considering I have paid over $27,000 and still owe $12,000 more. It would be nice to still have a decent car after I finally pay it off. I'd appreciate the help.
Car has been burning oil since September of 2024. It’s burning 2 quarts of oil every 500 miles. The oil is burning out spark plugs and coils every 3 months. These engines need to be recall and Hyundai needs to be held accountable.
The contact owns a 2017 Hyundai Sonata. The contact stated that within a two week period she has add to add 2 quartz of oil in the engine though she has yet to observe an oil leak. The check engine warning light was illuminated. The vehicle has was not taken to a dealer in independent mechanic. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was 161,000.
My engine burns oil like crazy. At least 1 qt every 1,000 miles or less. Took to dealership and was given a hard time about it having an issue. Now my power steering light keeps randomly coming on. I'll feel the steering start to get hard to steer. Thought I needed belts so I replaced both serpentine & water pump belt but it still happens. When my power steering light comes on and steering wheel locks up, I have to put the car in park & rev the engine to get the light to turn off. Mechanics said all pulleys are in good shape so not sure what's doing it. My lights also start to flicker when power steering light comes on. I have a new altenator and battery so it's not caused from that. I have no idea what's causing it but it's extremely dangerous!!
EGR cooler leaks and slowly burns off engine coolant resulting in the car overheating while driving, forcing a quick exit from the road, or stopping in traffic not to damage the engine. Google search shows this is a very common issue with these hybrids.
Key is stuck in ignition and won't come out. Key comes out maybe a half inch but won't turn either way. Steering wheel is not in locked position.
While driving the 2017 Hyundai Sonata Plug-In Hybrid, the car will begin to stall, a rapid number of audible beeps will start, the "Check Hybrid System" notification will pop up on the dashboard, and the "Check Engine Light" appears.. The car therefore cannot be driven anymore, and I am forced to pull over to the side. In order to fix the issue temporarily, I need to turn the car off and turn it back on again. Once this is completed, both the "Check Hybrid System" and the "Check Engine Light" disappears and the car can be driven again. An OBD Scanner is unable to find exactly what is going on as the "Check Hybrid System" and the "Check Engine Light" no longer appear.   This has happened 4 times now within the span of 3 months. The people at risk are me (the driver), my passengers, and potentially everyone else on the road in my nearby vicinity as the problem occurs.  This problem has been confirmed by the dealer in their Hybrid vehicles. This vehicle has not been inspected yet but that is an ongoing process.
I was driving the vehicle with 2 other occupants onboard on [XXX]  towards US-101. The EPS warning light already came on after entering [XXX] from [XXX], but initially, I didn't think it was much of an issue. As I merged to the right lane in preparation of entering the highway, the steering began to feel very stiff, so I immediately made a right turn into a local street when there was a little bit of steering left. As soon as I pulled over, the steering locked up completely, and both the EPS warning light and the dash display's lane-departure system warning were activated. Luckily no other vehicle or humans were endangered at the time. I put the car into park and powered it off. When I powered it back on again several minutes later, the issue resolved itself and I was able to continue driving with normal steering, and steering remained normal after several power on/off cycles which included both local and highway driving. Come to think of it, ~3 months before this incident happened, I already noticed occasional stuttering of the steering wheel and humming of the EPS assembly when the car is stationary or at low speed. I took the car to a third-party repair shop on the next day since the Hyundai dealership appointment is a week away at the earliest. They ran diagnosis before telling me that the steering sensor in the EPS motor assembly failed, and this happened very frequently for 2017 Sonata Plug-in hybrids. This happens so often, apparently, that Hyundai issued service bulletin [XXX], but this very much looks like a recall to me, as when the system fails, steering is lost completely, and could cause great harm to myself as well as the occupants onboard, not to mention other vehicles around me. I was lucky that it happened before I entered the highway and also had a place to pull over. INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
About 3 weeks ago I had just left my house, battery fully charged and gas tank full. I was coming down a hill to a stop sign and started braking. Suddenly the car seemed to lose power and essentially stopped moving. There was an error on the dash saying "hybrid system failure". There was barely able enough power to slowly pull the car over to the side of the road. I turned off the car and checked the battery in the trunk - I didn't see any obvious concerns. My husband got there 10 minutes later and we tried turning the car on again. It came on fine but there was an engine warning light. We were able to drive it without difficulty back to my house. I was unable to get a timely appointment at my local Hyundai dealer, so a couple days later My husband drove it to a local garage to see if they could figure out what the problem was. When he turned the car on again the engine light was no longer on. However, at the garage they were able to pull up a history of the car alerts and it confirmed that it said hybrid system failure. I have done some research online and it sounds like there was a recall on Hyundai sonatas hybrids for 2017 but I did not see a recall for the plug-in version of the hybrid. I searched online, however, and there were many other owners of Hyundai sonata plug-in hybrids that reported the same incident. I am hoping that a recall gets is issued for the plug-in hybrid as well so that more owners don't have the same problem. If I had been driving on the highway at 65 mph in a middle lane and my engine suddenly lost power it could have been fatal. Oh - one other recent problem I had that I'm not sure is related is that my car recently started losing electric miles very quickly. From the time it was purchased until a few months ago, it was losing plug-in miles at about 1 mi per year (i.e. each year a fully charged battery gave me 1 mile less). Then about 6 months ago it started losing electric miles very quickly - about 1/mo. Dealer said it was normal aging.
Engine Shut Off Without Warning problem of the 2017 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid While driving the car on the freeway, it will jerk forward and then shortly after lose power.   I pull over (luckily haven't been killed yet) on the side of the freeway.   I've taken my car to a Hyundai dealership third times. All Three time I was stranded on a busy california highway.  I have looked into this warning over a year and no one seems to know the problem. This should be a recall and all Hyundai dealers should be made aware of what this warning is. We as Hyundai owners need answers and help.
The engine has started to burn oil from the inside of the motor was first noticed May 8th after the oil sending unit was replaced on the March 17th 2023 I thought it was faulty took to the dealership and all the oil had burned out in it. Dealership filled it up went about 1k miles and the oil light came on again too it back to the dealership they decide to do 2 oil composition test on the car. The care failed both times and under the 1k mile mark. Told Hyundai about and put in a claim they entered the wrong mileage on my car so it was denied for recall. I was told to continue to keep just adding oil for every 1k miles I have done this since July 1st 2023 and still is doing it an the engine keeps just burring the oil in the engine
Engine burns oil at a very high rate. I can’t even make it to the recommended oil change mileage before it is completely out of oil and that is very unsafe. I have to either fill it up with oil or pay for a new oil change when it is not needed.
Excessive oil consumption
The check engine light started flashing Check hybrid system turn off engine massage appeared  The gas pedal doesnt work and the car jumps   The problem happened 4 times so far with me   The same problem happened about 5 times with my uncle that drives 2016 sonata hybrid
Total loss of power while driving occurred on 2 separate occasions driving the Hyundai Sonata. The dashboard lit up with multiple failures with no warning, and car lost all power. Both times were in peak traffic conditions and on one of the two instances, a very dangerous mountain road with very little time to react. Towed on 2 occasions to 2 different dealers with no clear cut fix for the car. These were very scary and dangerous incidents and I am afraid to drive this car to be honest. Hyundai has not done much to contact or reassure me that they were dealing with the situation.
2017 Hyundai Sonata with Theta II engine received knock sensor detection software update 7/30/19. Engine knock increased substantially during August and September of 2022 with periodic, partial loss of power at idling and significant oil consumption. Dealership initiated oil consumption testing 9/24/22. On 11/2/22, vehicle fully stalled with blue smoke from exhaust during slow-speed turn in normal driving conditions. Owner and child in vehicle were uninjured. Dealership unable to replicate stall or identify error codes. Dealership's 11/11/22 oil consumption test identified excessive oil consumption. Dealership cleaned combustion chamber. Vehicle experienced partial stall 12/15/22 at moderate speed in normal driving conditions. Dealership performed final oil consumption test 12/20/22 and reported normal oil consumption (.25 quart in 1,000 miles).
While driving the electric power steering locked and I couldn’t turn while driving. Hit curb and someone’s personal property. I was so frustrated because there wasn’t anything I could do. The steering locks up and you can’t move it.
The contact owns a 2017 Hyundai Sonata. The contact stated while driving approximately 70 MPH, the vehicle stopped accelerating as needed. There were no warning lights illuminated. The contact activated the hazard lights and coasted the vehicle to the residence. The contact then was followed by a friend to the dealer. The vehicle was diagnosed with a knock sensor and cylinder failure. The vehicle was repaired; however, the failure reoccurred. Additionally, while attempting to shift the vehicle into reverse, the vehicle failed to respond. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 85,700.
While driving my 2017 Sonata on a winding backroad my power steering suddenly locked up without warning, and I was unable to turn the vehicle left or right. Prior to this incident there were no warning or check engine lights lit indicating any type of issue with my car, and my power steering was operating normally. I hit, and jumped a curb striking a rock wall attempting to turn slightly left to keep myself in my lane, and on the road damaging the right passenger side rim and fender. After coming to a stop I noticed there were two warning lights that had activated. I immediately called my local Hyundai dealer (Imperial Hyundai of Milford Massachusetts) informing them of what had happened, and scheduled a service appointment to have this issue diagnosed. I was informed by the dealership that Hyundai is having issues with their electric assist steering motor, and computer module which controls the steering assist motor. Had this been my wife or son this would have definitely turned out differently, because I'm over 240lbs and could barely get the steering wheel to turn at all prior to hitting the curb. After shutting off the car, and then restarting it repeatedly for approx 30 minutes suddenly the service lights went out, and the vehicle started operating normally again. My appointment at the Hyundai dealer is on July 13, 2022. I was told Hyundai has extended the warranty on parts associated with the steering system, but they wouldn't tell me which parts are covered or not covered. That is the least of my concerns, because like I said had I not been the driver, or if this had happened at highway speed this could have been tragic. It's a serious safety issue
I only had my car for 5 months the car out of no where started to jerk and my car stopped now my car is at the dealership but my car been there for a month now nothing is being done to it.
I own a 2017 Hyundai Sonata. About a year ago I was driving it and suddenly the steering wheel froze and I lost control of my car. Two warning lights went on. I pulled off the road to a safe place, struggling to turn the steering wheel in the direction I needed to go. I turned the car off. When I turned the car back on, everything seemed normal. The next day I took it to the Hyundai Dealer in Renton, WA. They ran it through a $180 diagnostic but couldn’t come up with a problem.  Fast forward to May 1, 2022. As I was leaving a parking lot the steering froze up and it was hard to control just like the first incident. Two lights came on, the stabilizing and a triangle with an ! indicator lights.  Again, I turned the engine off and back on and it worked normally. 30 miles later while maneuvering a turn, the car froze up again in heavy traffic. Turning the car off and back on fixed it.  Today I took the car back to the same Renton Car Pro Hyundai.  They determined this time that the steering column needed to be replaced for a cost of $2005 and it wasn’t under warranty.  (the mechanic said that it expired 12000 miles earlier---about a year ago).  I have since researched the internet on this problem, and it is widely known that this is a problem has affected many Sonata drivers. https://www.carproblemzoo.com/hyundai/sonata/steering-problems2.php This problem causes extreme safety issues. It causes the driver to lose control of the vehicle. It appears to happen at unknown or predictable times and gives the feeling of being in a very unsafe auto. This car has 73k miles and has not been in any accidents. I am the original owner and have had regular servicing on the vehicle. I believe it is important for the auto makers to be held accountable for having so many vehicles with this problem. It is an expense that should not fall onto the owner of the car.  I hope you will research the documented reports of many, many incidents where the steering has froze up during operation.
On January 8, 2022, I called McGrath City Hyundai and Genesis of Oak Park to ask about any recent recalls on my vehicle due to my engine leaking out oil after putting in new oil. Prior to that, I had a mechanic look at it in case the oil change place made a mistake on their end and found they were not at fault. So after the Hyundai dealership told me there was 2 recalls that she can see from her end based on my VIN, 1 for the engine and the other for the trunk, we set up an appointment to try and repair the vehicle because at this point the vehicle was not drivable and we had to get it towed. We also had no prior knowledge that there was any recall due to the fact we bought the vehicle in May of 2020 from a dealership called Toyota of Lincoln Park. After bringing in paperwork to Hyundai in person for proof we have been maintaining the car and after waiting weeks for our car to be fixed, we are being told they cannot fix the engine due to the fact that the recall was from 2018 and the previous owners did nothing to resolve the issue. We were also told that the dealership that sold us the vehicle cannot look up recalls from other vehicles and only can do it with Toyota. The car had already almost failed on the expressway and could have caused an accident had we not pulled off to the exit. And we were fortunate enough to get it to our home. The engine wasn't locked up and we feel now it might be while in the hands of Hyundai. Hyundai has denied the claim to have it serviced due to it being a 2018 recall and all we want is the car running again. We cannot afford to get another car and it is our only means of transportation.
The electrical steering system lock up.  If I cannot steer it a big safety problem for me and other drivers Will call dealer today (not sure if it must be towed) No inspection yet Yes I did get a waring lamp light but the streeing wheel could not be moved ( light came on after staring car
I lost the ability to steer my car any more than 15 to 20 degrees in any direction while traveling at a maximum speed of 25 mph and within approximately 300 yards of driving. Once steering control became limited a warning was displayed on my dash very briefly saying my high beams were not functioning properly. Then my dash showed 7 different warning icons. My safety and that of others was most definitely put at risk. The dealer told me they had to replace the steering column. He also told me that this type of malfunction only occurs on the Hybrid models of the Sonata.

ISSUE: CRUISE CONTROL SPEEDS UP TOO MUCH GOING UPHILL, AND SLOWS DOWN TOO MUCH GOING DOWNHILL.   DESCRIPTION: I SET MY CRUISE CONTROL TO 75MPH, THE CAR WILL GO OVER 77MPH WHEN GOING UPHILL, AND SLOWS DOWN BELOW 73MPH WHEN GOING DOWNHILL WITHOUT ANY DRIVER INPUT. THIS DOESN'T OCCUR ON OTHER GASOLINE ONLY HYUNDAI I DROVE SUCH AS SANTA FE. IT ONLY HAPPENS ON MY SONATA HYBRID. I GUESS HYUNDAI MAY NEED TO LOOK INTO HOW THE ELECTRIC MOTOR WORKS WITH CRUISE CONTROL.  *TR
WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, A NOTICE WAS SHOWN ON THE DASHBOARD THAT THE HYBRID SYSTEM AND CRUISE CONTROL SYSTEM WERE NO LONGER FUNCTIONAL. THE VEHICLE THEN STARTED TO ACCELERATE, UPHILL, WITHOUT THE GAS PEDAL BEING ENGAGED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN OFF THE HIGHWAY AND WHEN COMING TO A NEAR COMPLETE STOP THE VEHICLE STOPPED WORKING COMPLETELY. AFTER RESTARTING THE VEHICLE AND DRIVING IT TO A SAFE PLACE TO PARK A NOTICE INDICATED THE BREAKS WERE NO LONGER FUNCTIONAL. THE CAR WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TOWED. THE VEHICLE HAS HAD NUMEROUS REPAIRS SINCE AND IS STILL EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUE(S) AS OF 12/05/2019.
POWER STEERING LOCKS UP OR STOPS, WHEN CAR IS MOVING OR WHEN PARKING,  I HAVE TO SHUT THE CAR OFF TO RESTORE STEERING.  THIS PROBLEM HAS NEARLY CAUSE 3 ACCIDENTS, THE HYUNDIA DEALER HAD THE CAR IN SHOP 2 TIMES AND SAID THEY CAN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM SO THE CAN'T FIX. I KNOW MANY OTHER OWNERS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. THIS PROBLEM HAPPENED ON THE HWY'S AND IN TOWN DRIVING.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2017 HYUNDAI SONATA. WHILE STOPPED AT A LIGHT, THE VEHICLE STALLED AND WAS UNABLE TO RESTART. ALSO, THE CHECK ENGINE WARNING INDICATOR ILLUMINATED. THE CONTACT WAS FINALLY ABLE TO RESTART THE VEHICLE AND DROVE HOME. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO WORLD HYUNDAI MATTESON (LOCATED AT 5337 MILLER CIR DR, MATTESON, IL 60443, (866) 486-2915) WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT IT CONSUMED AN EXTREME AMOUNT OF OIL, BUT THERE WAS NO REMEDY AVAILABLE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 57,000.
I WENT TO OPEN THE PASSENGER DOOR ON THE DRIVERS SIDE & THE DOOR HANDLE SNAPPED RIGHT OFF.
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
WHILE DRIVING TO WORK THIS MORNING, BRAND NEW HYUNDAI SONATA WITH 980 MILES SHUT DOWN AND TURNED ITSELF OFF WHEN I MADE A STOP AT A RED LIGHT.  I WAS LUCKY I WASN'T MOVING FAST ON A HIGHWAY WHEN IT HAPPENED AND DIDN'T GET INTO AN ACCIDENT, BUT IT'S TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE FOR A BRAND NEW CAR TO SHUT DOWN LIKE THIS.
My car is consuming oil. Hyundai knows this is happening with the theta II engines. I was told to bring it in and do an oil consumption test which shows my car is consuming 1 qt oil every 406 miles but was denied help due to it being high Mileage and not under warranty. My car has now started misfiring due to cylinder 1 & 2 consuming oil.
On 05/27/2025, my rear back-up camera started to malfunction. Last week my dash started to malfunction electronically. When I would start my vehicle, all of the lights would start to turn on and stay on on my dash. My speedometer would not move while I was driving, so I could not see how fast I was going. I believe this is a severe safety issue for myself as well as others. The tachometer would jump up and down and would not function correctly. My dash stated that I had low tire pressure, that I was having problems with my traction control, that my BSD system was not working, that my ABS was not working, that my emergency brake was on even though it was not. It also stated that I did have functioning air bags, which is a severe safety hazard in the chance that I could've gotten into a wreck and they might not have worked. It also stated that I was not in Drive even though I clearly was. It also stated that I had no power steering while I was driving, before the light would turn off and I could properly steer again. This is a severe safety issue that could put me at risk. Finally, my check engine light turned on and stayed on. Yesterday on 06/09/2025 I was able to take it a vehicle maintenance shop so they could run a full diagnostic test. They discovered that I did not have power steering even though there was fluid due to the electrical problems with my dash. They also discovered the C-CAN buss was off and that my vehicle was losing communications with the TCM and HVAC. It was discovered that this was due to my rear view back-up camera malfunctioning, causing the C-CAN network to short out. They had to unplug my rear back-up camera to return everything to normal. I have found on hyundai recall forms that other years of hyundai models had similar problems and I believe that 2018 hyundai sonatas are also having the same problem. I wanted it to be made aware because online, people have stated they are having the same issues. Attached gif that shows part of problem.
2018 Hyundai Sonata Registered owner [XXX]  Vin [XXX]  Which qualifies for a replacement engine under the "recall" and "class action" due to engine oil consumption damage. On [XXX] I was driving home from California, and my 2018 Hyundai Sonata made a loud noise and stalled on me while driving on the freeway. On Jan 2, 2025 I towed my 2018 Hyundai Sonata to ABC Hyundai for repairs. I was told the engine failed or locked up. I have a drivetran warranty up to 150k. My vehicle currently has 115k. However, Hyundai denied the engine repair stating that I neglected the maintenance on the vehicle. They were requesting oil change receipts from 2018 when I bought the car. I've submitted all oil change documents that I could find. Most auto shops have purged their system, updated their software and also got entirely new systems, therefore those receipts were not found. Carfax also has a record of oil changes. I did not always take my vehicle to the dealer for oil changes since our family has a certified mechanic that can vouch for all the other oil changes done on the vehicle. Including tune-ups. The dealer and I have provided several oil change receipts approx. 18+ carfax, Hyundai, family mechanic and misc. receipts. That's should be more than enough evidence for Hyundai to honor their warranty. Please help. NOW HMA says t claim for oil consumption and repairs were denied due to the vehicle being outside of warranty based on time and mileage. Once a claim is denied that is the final decision from HMA. This is untrue my vehicle is NOT out of warranty. Due to the oil consumption class action, and faulty engine put in ny car, the drivetran warranty was extended to 150K, and my vehicle is only has 115K and 7 years old. Hyundai put a bad engine in my vehicle to begin with. A few months ago I got a oil change at Firestone, 4 weeks later there wasn't a drop of oil in my car, that is a problem. Everytime I got a oil change, I had to extra oil after 3-4 week INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
The electrical and engines in these cars are horrible . The steering wheel keeps locking up while driving cause everything to flick inside the car . This is a major safety issue for me when I am driving and I am unable to control the steering wheel. Dealership claimed they don’t see the issue with the car which I am stating . The vehicle was only inspected by a mechanic and since Hyundai said they couldn’t find anything a 3rd party confirmed that this was a ongoing issue and dealership could’ve caught it but it’s cheaper the sell the car . No everything happens at once especially if I’m turning or driving under 40 mph. First appeared 15 days after I bought the vehicle I alerted the dealership immediately
The engine of my 2018 Hyundai Sonata has been losing oil at a significant rate. By the time I take my car in for a regular oil change the oil is either completely out or nearly out. I contacted Hyundai regarding an oil consumption test which is what was recommended to me by Hyundai corporate when I called to report the problem. Hyundai has completed the oil consumption test and although they stated that it is consuming oil at a higher than normal rate, it still meets their “standard” and the recommendation that they have was to fill up my oil every time I put gas in my car which is an unreasonable expectation .  The safety risk is significant. Although Hyundai recognizes this is an issue, they have said that there is nothing they can do. For a vehicle that has only 79,000 miles on it, there is no indication of where the oil is leaking to. During my last oil change, valvoline stated that this is a known issue and that the oil leaks into the engine of the vehicle. Hyundai inspected the vehicle and again stated that although it is burning oil off at a higher than normal rate, their standards state that it is not burning off enough to warrant an engine repair. The oil warning light did appear just before my last oil change which was approximately January 2024. When the light came on, I immediately scheduled an oil change and that is when I was first made aware that this was a known issue with certain Hyundai models
Purchased this vehicle with about 64K miles. Vehicle, as per CarFax report, has been meticulously maintained. Upon delivery, we changed the oil and filter with full-synthetic Amsoil. We ensured oil levels were appropriate prior to returning to service. No more than 1,000 miles later, roughly incurred in about a month, we checked oil levels again. This time, it required about 1.25 quarts to return it to the appropriate level .We did research and apparently, there is a class-action lawsuit filed by owners of Hyundai vehicles with this specific engine, the Theta II 2.4L 4-cylinder engine. Here's an article making reference to apparently your organization already looking into these complaints.   [XXX]   Could you please advise if the NHTSA will take the necessary steps to request Hyundai to issue a recall? I have found multiple articles where Hyundai is rejecting to take any action on their own, in most cases, advising their customers that such level of oil consumption is 'normal'. That clearly contradicts their own owner's manual guidelines. I own a 2001 Chevrolet Suburban 1500LT with 302K miles and the vehicle will go nearly 5K miles between oil changes while requiring no more than 1/2 quart of oil to keep it at the appropriate levels. I also own a 2019 Honda Accord 2.0T that normally requires oil changes every 10K miles and it seldom requires more than 1/8 of a quart to keep at the appropriate oil levels.   There is definitely something definitely wrong with this engine type and requires governmental involvement to hold the manufacturer to provide adequate remediation.

My engine was burning oil, I was/ am up to date with my oil changes. The oil suddenly kept being dirty. My car broke down twice. One time oil was shooting out of the top of my engine and it was smoking. Hyundai claimed it was neglect and only accepted my paper copy of oil changes but not the ones on my debit card statement.
I was driving on freeway and all dashboard warning started to flicker on and off simultaneously then my steering wheel locked in place. I was unable to stop or turn wheel and had to maneuver car until it came to a stop. I had to get it towed home. I spoke with dealership and asked me to tow it to them so they can look at it and gave me a report that mention nothing about what I originally told them it did while I was driving but pointed out everything else that was wrong with it that added up to more than $4,500.00 in repairs. Dealership guy got upset that I asked him to email rather than phone calls and didn’t want to answer anything through email only phone calls he was refusing service and kept pushing us to approve all the other expenses without telling me anything about why the car did what it did. He then told me that it was my fault since car was just passed over 100,000 miles and I should’ve known that was going to happen. Luckily nobody got hurt during this. My wife was pregnant at the time and thank goodness nothing bad happened and dealership guy was so unprofessional and rude and just wanted our money rather than help by giving us any answers.
2018 Hyundai Sonata SEL-Cylinder Misfire with engine oil consumption. It is a hazard to drive a vehicle that can cut off or engine lock up while driving. The same  applied to 2014 -2015 Hyundai and Kia vehicles. Hyundai and Kia were required to replace the motors in those vehicles. Due to vehicles been unsafe to drive.  The vehicle is currently at the dealership now. First was told that engine was going to be replace under warranty.  Due to problem of lack of compression. But will not replace engine.

2018 HYUNDAI SONATA. CONSUMER WRITES IN REGARDS TO RUSTY BRAKES. *LD    THE CONSUMER STATED THE VEHICLE HAD ISSUES START DURING COLD WEATHER. IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT 15 MINUTES OR LONGER FOR THE VEHICLE TO TURN ON. THE BATTERY NEEDED TO BE REPLACED PREMATURELY. *JS
SINCE DAY OF DELIVERY TWO YEARS AGO, THE AEB SYSTEM HAS MALFUNCTIONED IN THAT WHILE DRIVING VEHICLE ON ANY ROAD TYPE, THE BRAKES COME ON WITH NO WARNING OR REASON, HAVE ALMOST BEEN REAR ENDED THREE TIMES.DEALER HAS NEVER FOUND ANYTHING WRONG AND INSISTS THE SYSTEM FUNCTIONS AS DESIGNED. THE RADAR OR CAMERA SYSTEMS HAVE TO HAVE A DEFECT. TOYOTA AND HONDA HAVE HAD THIS ISSUE BUT MADE EFFORTS TO CORRECT EITHER BY RECALLS OR SERVICE BULLETINS. PEDESTRIAN DETECTION HAS ALSO NEVER WORKED ON THIS VEHICLE..
MY DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN THE CAR STARTED TO BUCK AND WOULDN'T ACCELERATE.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND SHE PULLED OFF THE HIGHWAY.  SHE CALLED HYUNDAI AND THEY TOLD HER NOT TO DRIVE THE CAR AND TO HAVE IT TOWED TO A DEALERSHIP.  WE WERE THEN TOLD BY HYUNDAI THAT THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM.  THEY INSTALLED A KNOCK SENSOR WIRING HARNESS AND SAID THEY HOPE THAT DOES THE TRICK BUT IT COULD NEED A WHOLE NEW ENGINE.  EXPECTED REPAIR TIME IS 6 WEEKS SINCE PARTS ARE ON BACKORDER.  WE HAVE SINCE SPOKEN TO SEVERAL DEALERSHIPS AS WELL AS CONSUMERS AND THERE ARE SO MANY COMPLAINTS THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WITHOUT THEIR CARS FOR MONTHS.
I TOOK MY 2018 HYUNDAI SONTA SE IN FOR ITS FIRST OIL CHANGE WITH 3564 MILES ON IT. THEY DID A COMPUTER UPDATE AS PART OF A RECALL. I DROVE LESS THAN ( MILES FROM THE DEALERSHIP, WENT TO PULL OUT FROM A STOP LIGHT. IT STARTED MISS FIRING AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STARTED FLASHING. I WENT BACK TO THE DEALER. THEY SAID IT HAD A CODE AND TGEY HAD TO CALL HYUNDAI TO FIND OUT WHAT TO DO. THEY GAVE ME A LONER AND TOLD ME THE WIRING HARNESS HAD TOO MUCH INTERFERENCE/STATIC IN IT AND THEY HAD TO ORDER A NEW ONE. VERY HARD TO BELIEVE A COMPUTER UPDATE WOULD CAUSE THE WIRING HARNESS TO GO BAD.
THE HEADLIGHTS ON MY 2018 HYUNDAI SONATA SHOW TWO BLACK NOTCHES AND A BLACK LINE ABOUT 30 FEET IN FRONT OF THE CAR IN LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS.  IT IS VERY DISTRACTING AND DANGEROUS AS THESE SHADOWS DART ACROSS YOUR PATH AS YOU MAKE TURNS OR GO UP HILLS. HYUNDAI SERVICE COULD SEE THE NOTCHES, BUT SAID "THE SYSTEM IS WORKING WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS AT THIS TIME".  SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED BECAUSE OF THESE UNSAFE LIGHTS.

Engine burns oils horribly. Cannot sell car due to oil issues. Paint is chipping on exterior of the vehicle.
The contact owns a 2019 Hyundai Sonata. The contact stated that while driving at approximately 70 MPH, the vehicle inadvertently revved and decelerated to 40 MPH while the accelerator pedal was depressed. The check engine warning light was illuminated. The vehicle was towed to the dealer where it was diagnosed that timing chain had failed and the engine needed to be replaced. The vehicle was repaired; however, the failure recurred. The contact stated that while driving at undisclosed speeds, the check engine warning light illuminated. The contact then stated that occasionally she needed to add engine oil between oil changes. The dealer was not notified of the failure. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and a case number was provided. The failure mileage was approximately 220,000.
Unknown. This has happened a couple times now. I am driving and the HEV light, engine light and battery light turn on, car won’t brake properly and almost cause me to hit other cars and will shut off on its own on the highway. It will accelerate on its own even when trying to brake. Extremely dangerous.
WHILE TRAVELING IN ONE DIRECTION, AN ONCOMING VEHICLE ATTEMPTED TO U-TURN IN AN INTERSECTION WITH NO TRAFFIC LIGHTS OR STOP SIGNS. THEY HIT MY CAR IN THE FRONT DRIVER'S SIDE, CAUSING ENOUGH DAMAGE FOR THE VEHICLE TO BE TOWED AWAY AND TOTALED. IN THIS CRASH THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. THERE WAS NO PREVIOUS INDICATION THAT THE AIRBAGS WERE FAULTY, NO RECALL, AND THE VEHICLE WAS BRAND NEW AT TIME OF PURCHASE 7 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT. LUCKILY, I WAS NOT INJURED ALTHOUGH MY HAND DID HIT THE STEERING WHEEL OR WINDOW (OR SOMETHING IN THAT VICINITY), IT WAS TOO QUICK TO REALLY REALIZE WHAT SPECIFICALLY I HIT.  *TR
Without warning, symptoms of the A/C blower not working first occurred a little over a month ago. The fan just stopped blowing altogether (no cold or hot air). After turning the car and the A/C system on and off several times, it began working again and that was it. This past week, the same issue occurred intermittently over 3-4 days. The A/C blower did not come on for a day, the next morning it was functioning, that evening it stopped blowing again, and this went on for several days. Research of the symptoms via YouTube and many online forums, and most importantly confirmation through visual inspection of the fuse box, confirmed that the BLOWER fuse is burning so bad it has melted the connecting port in the fuse box. Whatever the electrical malfunction, the fuse burning and melting is disrupting the connection and ultimately the A/C blower itself. In the dead of such a hot and humid summer, it has been insufferable having to ride around with such inconsistent and intermittent air conditioning.
Been having an issue with a check engine light and a popping noise in the from the front of the vehicle for about two years. Took it to the dealership more than 3 times over that span and every time they discovered it was caused by something different..during the July of 2024 while driving on the interstate a loud pop noise was made from the back and my children complain about the seat lifting…shortly after I went to get gas and a full tank was more gallons than usual 14 increased to 17g…. I once again took it to the dealer for the issue of the gas tank expansion and pop but found nothing. No more than a week later my car would hesitate to accelerate and progressively got worse. On 12/27/24 I took it to the dealer and they discovered my gas tank was expanded and was unsafe to drive leaving me without a vehicle.as of 1/04/2025 I still have no solution.
On July 15th I was driving away from work and my car suddenly stopped accelerating. I was able to get it towed to a body shop I previously had it repaired at. They said the battery system was blowing a fuse when it would become undrivable. They took it to the local Hyundai dealership where they applied a new software update related to the battery management system. This did not solve the issue, it continues to stop while in traffic and the dealership refuses to do anything to figure out the cause.
My vehicle is missing it's third brake light. We have confirmed that it was forgotten during manufacturing. The dealer won't cover it. They say call corporate. Corporate says dealer has to fix it. In the mean time I'm pulled over for improper equipment, and brake light being out. It's a serious safety issue, covered by federal law. They quoted over $1000 to have it fixed at my expense.
Exterior paint is peeling and stripping. Hood, doors, front and rear bumper, side skirts, and front lip.
Steering wheel makes whining/scrubbing noise when turning. Steering a vehicle is a critical component of safety and being able to avoid dangerous situations. The problem has been reported, inspected, and confirmed by a dealer. The component has not been inspected by the manufacturer, police, or independent service center. There were no warning messages, lamps, or other symptoms of the problem prior to failure. The problem first appeared when the vehicle was under 15,000 miles. The dealership advised that the worm shaft assembly needs to be replaced.
GASES FROM THE DASHBOARD HEATING CAUSE A FILM TO FORM BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND THE CAMERA. BECAUSE OF THIS, IN HEAVY DIRECT SUNLIGHT,  LANE KEEP ASSIST TOGGLES ON AND OFF WITHOUT WARNING CAUSING UNINTENDED LANE DEPARTURES WITH OUT WARNING. ALSO, WHEN USING SMART CRUISE CONTROL, THE VEHICLE SLOWS TO A STOP BUT MAY CONTINUE MOVING SLOWLY EVEN AFTER DISPLAYING THE PRESS GAS TO CONTINUE SCREEN. THE AUTO HOLD LIGHT DOES NOT ILLUMINATE.
I LOOKED UP UNDER THE HOOD, IT START RUSTING IN FRAME IN DRIVER SIDE. I CHECKED OTHER 2020 SONATA FROM DEALERSHIP AND THOSE CAR ARE EVEN WORST. THOSE CAR RUSTING DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE TOO.  *TR
Air flow check engine light alerted and source was faulty fuel injector which required replacement of 4 fuel injectors.
2021 Hyundai Sonata 59,850 miles  RPM jumps to around 1,300 at zero miles on occasion. If I am stopped, at a red light or behind other stopped autos,  the vehicle jumps forward when I take my foot off the brake. Because this happens quite often, I am aware of this and keep my foot on the brake until other vehicles are out of the way to avoid bumping into them. When this happens, I can cruise at 30 miles per hour without having my foot on the accelerator, I can slow down or stop by applying the brakes but the engine RPM stays at 1,300.  If I stop and shut off the vehicle and restart, the operation goes back to normal but occurs again later. The Hyundai dealer has had the vehicle back 9 times but the issue continues.  The first few times, they could not find an issue, I returned to the shop when this was happening and the service manager and a technician observed this condition, the EGR valve was replaced.  Was OK for a bit but condition returned, the computer was then replaced. Condition continued. Brought the vehicle back and a scan was done and system “re-learned.  After a short time the condition returned. Went back to the service center and they did another scan and another re-learn. Condition returned 4-5 days later.  Problem still not resolved. Have 59,850 miles on the vehicle, warranty expires at 60,00 miles. This started around July 1, Now October 5.  Waiting for a loaner so the service center can drive it around until the situation occurs and they can bring it in immediately for diagnosis.  This is the same issue as reported for the same year vehicle in July 2022.
The Battery dies randomly and requires the physical key to unlock the door.  It is a hybrid, so it has a 12 volt battery button that jumpstarts the car.  While driving the vehicle, the battery meter on the dashboard will show a near-full battery and then a near-empty battery within a few minutes.  This vehicle was bought brand new from a Hyundai dealership and for the first 2 years, there wasn't an issue.  The past few months, the battery issue started.
Discovered that I had no engine heat to use in the cabin with cooler outside temps. Checked coolant tank. Was nearly bone dry. 2021 hybrid is under warranty with only 35K miles on it and regular scheduled maintenance. Have also noticed puffs of white smoke upon easy acceleration and switching from battery to gas. Refilled engine coolant, but it continues to leak internally with use (no evidence of pooling under car) with short mile trips. Had to leave at dealership for repairs and cannot get a repair date for another month out. Other hybrid owners of 2020 and 2021 report their dealerships discovered the coolant is leaking into the engine and mixing with the exhaust (thus the white smoke). I am adding my car to the list of others who have reported the same problem.
After 9 months of ownership, on at least five (5) instances, the car has the following things happen at the same time: 1) all warning lights on the dashboard activate, 2) the battery discharge warning light activates, a loss of power steering, no speedometer, no cameras (rear or front), no AC, and all the safety functions are disabled including but not limited to:  Forward Collision Warning, Parking Collision Warning, Automatic Emergency Braking, Lane Departure Warning, Rear Cross Traffic Warning.  Yes, the car is available for inspection upon request. Safety is at risk by the loss of power steering and the deactivation of all safety functions. After each instance, the car has gone back to the manufacturer's dealer for inspection, they believed it might be an electrical issue after scanning for fault codes, but after 5 times, the dealer has not yet diagnosed the issue.
The contact owns a 2021 Hyundai Sonata. The contact received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 21V00M000 (Visibility) however, the part to do the recall repair was unavailable. The dealer was made aware of the issue and confirmed that parts were not yet available. The manufacturer was made aware of the issue. The contact stated that the manufacturer had exceeded a reasonable amount of time for the recall repair. The contact had not experienced a failure. VIN tool confirms parts not available.
Car is a Sonata Hybrid Limited equipped with a solar roof which charges the hybrid battery. Vehicle began to cut off battery power while parked, requiring the use of a factory equipped 12V override switch in March 2025 after approximately 3.5 years of ownership. This occurred multiple times, often when the car was parked in the sun but independent of how long it had been driven prior or how long it had sat without being started.   Evaluated by two Hyundai dealers; second dealer found a fault in the "solar DCDC converter" as well as the hybrid battery bulging. Battery module replaced. Unclear if this resolves the issue or it will recur again. Am speaking to Hyundai regarding battery warranty extension as vehicle had 88000 miles on it at the time of the issue starting.   Online fora (e.g., Reddit, Facebook) note other customers who have had similar problems with similar fixes.   - [XXX]   - [XXX]   - [XXX]  - one individual in this thread had complete power loss while driving down the highway  This issue potentially risks stranding customers, and if the hybrid battery continues to bulge increases the risk of fire which could lead to property damage, personal injury, or death.

I have had this car for 2 years (13K miles)....intermittently the car stops short when backing up. This has happened at least 15-20 times, backing out of my garage. It also happened twice backing out of a parking space. The most recent incident was driving on the hwy  at 70MPH and the emergency brake warning light came on causing the car to swerve, stop for a few seconds. Needless to say this was very scary. I am attaching a link with the same or similar complaints: [XXX]   I have been in touch with Corporate. The car is currently at the dealer ship and has been for 2 weeks. They are trying to duplicate the problem, but it is so intermittent, I doubt they will find anything. I was told they have to keep it for 30 days, then....I don't know what the next step is. I love this car, but no longer feel safe in it.  Please advise how you can help. INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
Loss of power while accelerating. Engine overheat notification. High oil temperature.
Shifter system malfunction service immediately was displayed on my dash 10+ times which caused me to not be able to shift my car out of drive or whatever gear I was in when this occurred.   I was at an intersection and when I was coming to a stop the car displayed this error code and wouldn’t allow me to go until I turned the car off and on twice till it was able to reset back to park then allowing me to start and shift to drive to actually go. This jeopardizes my safety and the safety of others considering my car could give out or not change gears at any given point. This is extremely concerning.  The problem has not been reproduced by the dealership but has been in 2 times for this issue within a month. I took pictures and showed it to the dealership and they said Hyundai won’t cover it. They felt bad and believed me so much to the point their service department is covering the cost of the Transmission shifter module (TCM) in hopes this will resolve the issue.  Only a Hyundai dealership has worked on my vehicle.
At 134000 miles car got a knock on interstate. 5 miles to next exit a loud bang. Then the knock went to a loud loud bang. Pulled over to find rod thru block. It is a 2010 kia optima with 2.4l 1 year before the recalls with exact probelm. Full of oil and coolant. Just out of the blue.

WHILE SITTING AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT, A VEHICLE REAR-ENDED MY 2010 KIA OPTIMA. THE DRIVER HIT MY KIA SO HARD, I HIT THE MUSTANG IN FRONT OF ME. NO AIR BAGS DEPLOYED UPON EITHER IMPACT. KIA WAS DRIVABLE, BUT THERE WERE NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCES IN THE WAY THE CAR DROVE (I.E. STARTED PULLING TO THE RIGHT, WHEEL SHAKING, ETC). THIS WAS THE EVENING OF 01/23/2014. ON 01/29/2014, THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKED UP AND COLLIDED WITH A PARKED VEHICLE (TOTALING THE KIA) @ 28-30 MPH. AGAIN AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY, AND THE IMPACT LIFTED ME UP AND MY HEAD SHATTERED THE WINDSHIELD FROM THE TOP. SEAT BELT WAS IN USE, BUT DID NOT LOCK UPON IMPACT, FAILING TO SECURE MY BODY. MAJOR CONCUSSION RECEIVED ALONG WITH MULTIPLE BRUISES, CUTS, AND SCRAPES. INVESTIGATION UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE STEERING MALFUNCTION DUE TO THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE.  *TR

After getting HECU recall done , it has caused issues with the HECU module to where the brake lights no longer work and the ESC light comes on the cluster panel. Up on reading the code C2130, it says Brake lamp relay error. Mind you that my car was in working order before this recall was even done. This a huge safety issue not having your brake lights work. I can get rear-ended and i have kids in the car. This has been a issue since July when i got the recall done and KIA has yet to find a fix for this matter.

The air bag and check engine warning lights were illuminated. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic, who diagnosed a failure with the knock sensor. The vehicle was not repaired. After investigating the failure, the contact related the failure to NHTSA Campaign Number: 23V652000 (Service Brakes, Hydraulic), and the VIN was included, but parts were not yet available. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was 157,000.
The contact owns a 2011 Kia Optima. The contact received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 23V652000 (Service Brakes, Hydraulic) however, the part to do the recall repair was not yet available. The contact stated while driving 37 MPH, he noticed a burning odor, and there was smoke coming from underneath the hood and through the A/C vents. The ABS warning light was illuminated. The contact was able to veer to the side of the road. The vehicle was towed to the residence. The local dealer and several unknown dealers were contacted. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The contact stated that the manufacturer had exceeded a reasonable amount of time for the recall repair. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 130,000. VIN tool confirms parts not available.
I was driving out of town and when I went to accelerate and the engine had seized, the brakes had locked up and I lost power steering which almost resulted in an accident. On the dash was showing the engine, oil, and esc light, which were not on the dash before and there was nothing wrong or weird going on with the car prior to the first incident to even indicate that something was wrong. Had to get the car towed home then realized there had been a recall on the engine. Contacted the kia manufacturer and they had towed it to a kia dealership where they replaced the engine. Waited 2 Months to get my car back, the dealership let me leave with the ABS and Eps light on the dash, and couldn't give me a reason why the lights were still on. I had it for 3 days, it drove okay and now it no longer drives nor does it start. I was stranded because the car wouldnt start again giving the same issues as before the recall repair was done, with only accessories turning on. On the dash it only shows  Engine, Oil, Eps and battery light. Found the Serpentine belt already coming apart and misplaced, found strips of the belt laying in the bottom of the hood. Also had found out the entire engine block ROCKS BACK AND FORTH while car is in motion. If I had driven the car any longer the belt would have completely snapped and would most likely result in an injury or worse. With the Engine movement that is also going to cause other damages to the car and more safety hazards. I have not even known about the engine recall on this car until after everything happened and when the car was purchased no one had notified me in anyway about the recall. Now they refuse to cover towing costs back to the dealership because the "5 year warranty had expired" When this in no way is my fault. Second incident was Oct. 17th 2022.
Safety: It appears the vehicle in question has had Engine, Electrical, and Driveability issues within less than 8,000 miles of it being on the road the First record of this vehicle show's one owner, purchased not from a Kia Dealership but a third party. The Carfax history showed there has been a driveability issue an ECM Module has been replaced twice? less than 30,000 miles? It's Believed that the warranty or millage has been used as a reason to deny repair and or Because as the Recall on the engine states it is undetermined as to what is causing a malfunction but it has or will result in fire. This becomes a liability for those who offer works on the vehicle. Something within the vehicle is without warning causing the vehicle to randomly fail while descending from 65-85 miles an hour. There are also sudden jerks that randomly accrue. rendering the car hard to maintain direction. Imagin a first-time driver attempting to handle this on a busy Highway in Texas -  The day we acquired the car we took it to KIA to do a full inspection - oil change, etc- The report given was that there are no problems identified but a computer module may need to be changed. We also asked that they give us an appraisal it was at that point they said that the car had a salvage title.  Which the seller who sold it us ARELLANO AUTO SALES  sail the title was clean. Last year a recall on the engine was issued. the insurance company determined the vehicle a total loss since how the car was branded a lost because it appears Kia refused to Fix the car, While everyone else says they can't recreate the issue for fear of liability. So here are with a car that has an undetermined engine issue that causes other electronics to malfunction. The vehicle has been seen at KIA dealerships according to the carfax. It's been seen. By two other service facilities and all have come up with something that may needed to be service while nothing has fixed the car
I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT STALLED ON ME.  IT WON'T TURN OVER OR ANYTHING.  IT STILL HAS ALMOST 1500 MILES ON UNTIL THE NEXT OIL CHANGE AND THE OIL PLUG IS ON AND TIGHT.

MY COLLEGE STUDENT DAUGHTER DRIVES THE VEHICLE AND IS UNABLE TO SEE SUFFICIENTLY AT NIGHT WHILE DRIVING. THE LIGHTS ARE TOO DIM TO SAFELY SEE AT NIGHT. THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO THE LOCAL KIA DEALERSHIP AND WE WERE TOLD IT WOULD BE $1,000 TO REPAIR THE WIRING PROBLEM THAT IS WELL KNOWN TO THE DEALERSHIP. WE WERE UNABLE TO AFFORD TO MAKE THE REPAIR AND THE DEALERSHIP TOLD HER TO DRIVE WITH HER BRIGHT LIGHTS ON WHILE DRIVING AT NIGHT WHICH COULD CAUSE OTHER DRIVERS ISSUES.
WHILE ON MY WAY TO PICK UP MY DAUGHTER FROM SCHOOL AT AROUND BETWEEN 1 AND 2 OCLOCK PM I WAS STOPPED AT A 4 WAY STOP AT GA HWY 225 IN SPRINGPLACE , AS I PROCEEDED THROUGH THE 4 WAY WHILE IN MOTION I HEAR AND FEEL A SUDDEN JOLT TO MY VEHICLE AND I SKID TO A STOP THANK GOD IT HAD JUST WENT THROUGH THE STOP SIGN AND DID NOT GAIN ANY SPEED. I EXITED THE VEHICLE AND GLANCED UNDERNEATH THINKING THAT I HAD HIT SOMETHING, INSTEAD I NOTICED THAT MY MOTOR AND TRANSMISSION WHERE NO LONGER CONNECTED TO MY VEHICLE ON THE DRIVER SIDE BUT THEY WHERE LAYING ALMOST ON THE GROUND. I HAD TO CALL A TOW TRUCK TO HAVE MY CAR TOWED HOME AND MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR MY DAUGHTER. MY VEHICLE WAS ONE ON THE LIST THAT HAD A RECALL ON THE MOTOR THE REPLACEMENT MOTOR WAS INSTALLED AROUND MARCH OF 2017. IT HAS NOT SHOWED ANY SIGNS OF TROUBLE UNTIL THIS.

I BELIEVE DEBRIS FROM THE ENGINE MANUFACTURING PROCESS BLOCKED OIL LUBRICATION PASSAGEWAYS NOT ONLY TO THE ENGINE BEARINGS, BUT ALSO TO THE OIL PRESSURE SENSOR.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THE INSPECTION PROCEDURE DEVELOPED BY KIA TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE ENGINE IS OK OR NEEDS TO BE REPLACED IS 100% EFFECTIVE.

HEARING A KNOCKING NOISE IN THE STEERING WHEEL WHILE SITTING STILL OR MOVING WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL IS MOVED FROM SIDE TO SIDE, ALOT OF FREEPLAY IN THE STEERING WHEEL. WHEN YOU HIT A BUMP THERE IS A LOUD CLANKING NOISE FROM THE STEERING COLUMN. I WAS TOLD BY MY FRIEND WHO HAS A 2012 OPTIMA THAT HE HAS THE SAME PROBLEM AND HE WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT IT WAS A PLASTIC GEAR IN THE STEERING COLUMN AND WOULD COST ROUGHLY $300 TO FIX. UPON RESEARCH WITH THIS ISSUE I HAVE COME ACROSS SEVERAL OWNERS THAT SEEM TO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WHICH KIA KNOWS ABOUT. I FEEL THAT KIA SHOULD CORRECT THIS PROBLEM AT THEIR EXPENSE BEFORE THIS ISSUE KILLS SOMEONE.
LOW BEAMS ARE NOT ILLUMINATING.. THE REFELECTIVE PAINT INSIDE HAS BURNED OFF AND I CANNOT DRIVE AT NIGHT WITH OUT MY HIGH BEAMS DUE TO THE FACT THAT I CAN'T SEE MORE THAN 2 FEET IN FRONT OF MY CAR. THE STEERING ON MY CAR STARTED THIS CLICKING NOISE WHEN TURNING AND THE STEERING WHEEL RATTLES WHEN I GO OVER THE SMALLEST BUMP ON THE ROAD. IT IS ALSO WEARING OUT MY TIRES AND CAUSING MY CAR TO PULL SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT.

ON 5-4-14  I WAS DRIVING FROM WISCONSIN WHEN WE DECIDED TO STOP AT WAL-MART, WHILE WE WERE WAITING FOR A PERSON TO MOVE OUT OF ITS PARKING SPOT, MY  OPTIMA START TO ACCELERATE EVEN WHEN I HAD MY FOOT IN THE BRAKE, MY FIRST REACTION WAS TO MOVE THE GEAR SHIFT TO NEUTRAL AND THEN THE ENGINE START RACING UP THE RPM WERE VERY FAST (WAS IN NEUTRAL), AT THE MOMENT A LADY AND HER SMALL KID WERE CROSSING IN FRONT OF MY CAR, GOD KNOWS WHAT IT WOULD HAPPENED IF I WOULDN'T MOVE THE GEAR TO NEUTRAL.  THIS IS THE THIRD TIME LAST YEAR IT DID THE SAME THING IN JULY WHEN I WAS AT THE STOP SIGN , THE SECOND TIME WAS THIS YEAR IN JANUARY WHEN I CAME BACK HOME FROM WORK THEN I WAS PARKING WHEN THE CAR STARTING ACCELERATING BUT I WAS HOLDING UP WITH CONCRETE BAR ON THE GROUND THAT IS IN MY PARKING LOT, AT THAT TIME I SHUT THE ENGINE OFF, BUT IT WAS NOT MUCH OF CONCERN BECAUSE I WAS NOT DRIVING THE CAR IN THE STREET.  NEXT DAY (5-5-14) TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER, AND THEY CONTACTED KIA TO REPORT THIS ISSUE, ON MAY 7 AT 4:20 PM A GENTLEMAN FROM KIA  HIS NAME WAS [XXX] CALLED ME TO GET SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THIS SUDDEN ACCELERATION AND TOLD HIM EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED  AND GAVE A CASE #2706364, THEN ON 5-7-14 ANOTHER GENTLEMAN FROM KIA  CORPORATION CALLED ME, HIS NAME [XXX], AND TOLD ME THAT HE IS IN CHARGE OF MY CASE NOW AND WILL CALL ME TO LET ME KNOW ABOUT THE OUTCOME OF THIS, WELL HE DIDN'T CALL SO I CALLED HIM BACK ON 5-15-14, (10 DAYS LATER), HE TOLD ME HE WAS WAITING FOR THE DEALERSHIP TO CALL HIM, I WENT TO THE DEALER AND I WAS INFORMED BY ED THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT THEY WERE DOING SOME TESTS, HE CALLED ME LATER SAYING THAT HE TALKED TO [XXX] IN KIA CORPORATION AND HE GAVE 11 POINT OF INSPECTION TO DO.

I BOUGHT A BRAND NEW 2011 KIA OPTIMA HYBRID AND THE CAR PULLS HEAVILY TO THE LEFT EVEN ON STRAIGHT ROADS.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND THEY DID AN ALIGNMENT AND THEY SAY IT IS WITHIN SPECS BUT IT ACTS THE SAME. IF YOU LET GO OF THE STEERING WHEEL FOR A COUPLE SECONDS YOU'RE ON THE SHOULDER. THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  SECOND ISSUE IS THAT BOTH DRIVER AND PASSENGER SEATS WERE BOLTED DOWN IN ONE BOLT OUT OF FOUR. THE DEALER INSTALLED THE MISSING BOLTS BUT THIS MAKES ME REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THE QUALITY CONTROL AT KIA. WHAT ELSE MIGHT THEY MISSED?  I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED HAD I BEEN INVOLVED IN A COLLISION BEFORE NOTICING THIS. UNACCEPTABLE! *TR
I AM ALSO HAVING THE LEFT PULL ISSUE WITH MY 2011 KIA OPTIMA. I ALERTED THE DEALER AS SOON AS IT LEFT THE LOT AND TOOK THE CAR IN FOR SERVICE ON 5/2/11. SPOKE WITH THE SERVICE TECH TODAY (5/4) AND HE SAID THAT ALL OF THE ALIGNMENT SPECS WERE WITHIN FACTORY STANDARDS BUT THE CAR IS STILL PULLING LEFT. CURRENTLY AWAITING GUIDANCE FROM KIA'S CORPORATE ENGINEERS. THIS PRESENTS A CLEAR DANGER AS THE CAR WILL SWITCH LANES UNLESS CONSTANT PRESSURE IS PUT ON THE STEERING WHEEL.  *TR
Car thought I was breaking when I was pressing the gas and I was merging into a left lane.  I was able to turn on the car without pressing the brakes due to the latter. The car doors are unlocking while im driving without warning. Also traction light on car cameo on
The steering is making a clunking noise when backing up and going forward at low speed.  There is a TSB by Kia about the steering motor rubber gear spacer that simply disintegrates over time  but Kia is only performing repairs on vehicles in warm humid areas up to South Carolina.  Why up to South Carolina?    Being we live on the Eastern End of Long Island in Southampton Town in New York :  we are surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean to the South and Long Island Sound to the North. On Long Island, the temperature frequently approaches 100 degrees in the summer  and is very humid also. I would say we qualify for a recall based on what the TSB says.    There should be a recall for every Kia Optima along the Coastal United States that has this issue as it could become quite dangerous.  From what I have heard and  seen on line , it is a multi hour repair for several hundred dollars.    The  NTSB should get a recall done not a TSB.
Kia sent out a safety recall notice (23V652).  The letter clearly states the remedy is now available for my vehicle; that an engine compartment fire while parked or driving is the primary risk of the default; and that the recall service will take approximately 1-2 hours.  I called two dealerships.  Both said Kia won't send them the parts until an inspection has occurred - potentially resulting in requiring two different appointments prior to this safety recall being addressed - contrary to the verbatim language in the safety recall.  I called Kia's customer service line and they confirmed that although the letter is written as described above, they won't provide parts to service centers until an inspection has been performed.  I filed a complaint with them but know it won't matter unless someone with more authority gets involved.  Considering this is a genuine life-safety issue - with the risk being a fire to the engine compartment - and the language in the recall notice - that the remedy is now available and the service will take 1-2 hours (no implication of multiple visits/appointments) - I think this is absolutely unacceptable.    Someone needs to ensure Kia prioritizes human lives above cost when it comes to safety recalls.
MY CAR IS A 2013 KIA OPTIMA. IT HAS BEEN CHIPPING ABOUT 1 YEAR AFTER I PURCHASED IT. NOW ITS JUST REAL REAL BAD. IT IS THE PEARL WHITE AND CHIPPED ON THE HOOD, ROOF, PASSENGER SIDE DOOR BEHIND THE DRIVER SIDE, TOP OF TRUNK, SIDE OF TRUNK, FRONT OF THE HOOD. IT LOOKS HORRIBLE.

My car caught on fire while driving from somewhere near the engine. The fire was so severe that fire department nor my insurance company were able to determine cause of fire and I’d only had vehicle for 45 days, it was a single owner with no accidents and maintained its entire life up to that point. I am requesting someone to examine vehicle and tell me how this possibly happened.
A few months ago the paint on my car begin to bubble, chip, and peel away. The paint color is Snow white and I have been informed of and read a lot about de-lamination occurring in the pearl and snow white paint of some Kia models. The car has not been involved any accidents and is in great condition aside from the unknown cause of the paint chipping.

THE ENGINE WAS REPLACED HOWEVER, AFTER SEVERAL THOUSAND MILES THE FAILURE RECURRED WITH THE NEW ENGINE. THE CONTACT THE CALLED THE CABLE DAHMER KIA OF LEE'S SUMMIT (400 NE COLBERN RD, LEE'S SUMMIT, MO 64086, (816) 207-6200) AND WAS INFORMED OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 20V750000 (ENGINE). THE CONTACT HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DEALER FOR THE ENGINE REPLACEMENT BUT WAS INFORMED THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO REPLACE THE ENGINE UNDER THE RECALL BECAUSE THE VEHICLE WAS OVER 150,000 MILES. THE CONTACT NOTIFIED THE MANUFACTURER OF THE FAILURE AND THE MANUFACTURER AGREED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE FREE REPAIR. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 162,000.
TRANSMISSION HAS A HARD PULL WHEN IT DOWN SHIFTS FROM THIRD GEAR TO SECOND GEAR AND A HARDER PULL ON FIRST GEAR THIS IS A AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION. IN REGULAR GEARS GOING IN DRIVE WOULD ACTUALLY DO FINE I NOTICED A WEEK LATER WHEN I WAS OUT DRIVING FOR ABOUT AN HOUR THAT THE CAR WOULD NOT GO PAST SECOND GEAR SO I PULLED OFF THE ROAD AND HAD MY CAR TOWED. THE VEHICLE HAS NEVER HAD ANY DASHBOARD LIGHTS COME ON CURRENTLY MY CAR IS IN LIMP MODE AND WILL ONLY GO IN REVERSE TAKES A FEW SECONDS TO INITIATE AN ENGAGE TO GO INTO FIRST GEAR.DEALERSHIP DOES NOT REALLY WANT TO LOOK AT THE VEHICLE IF IT DOES NOT HAVE A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CODE I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS TRANSMISSION I HAVE 168,000 MILES. IT SHOULD GIVE YOU SOME TYPE OF WARNING THAT SOMETHING IS GOING ON WITH YOUR TRANSMISSION BUT IT DOES NOT EVEN LIGHT UP ON YOUR DASHBOARD IF YOU GO TO PRESS THE PEDAL TO ACCELERATE IT DOES NOT WANT TO ACCELERATE I JUST RECENTLY HAD MY CATALYTIC CONVERTER CHANGED OUT SO I KNOW IT IS NOT THAT THE GEARS ON THE TRANSMISSION WILL NOT GO PAST SECOND GEAR NOW IT IS IN WHAT THEY CONSIDER LIMP MODE OR DEFAULT MODE SOMEONE REALLY NEEDS TO LOOK AT THE TRANSMISSION ON ALL THE 2012 KIA OPTIMAS I HAVE BEEN SEEING A LOT OF ISSUES WITH THESE CARS  THE LIGHTS THAT ARE CONSIDERED AS THE LOW BEAMS ARE NOT VERY BRIGHT EITHER I JUST RECENTLY HAD THOSE CHANGED AND NEW ONES PUT IN THEY DO NOT GIVE YOU ENOUGH LIGHT IF YOU'RE DRIVING AT NIGHT THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD
MY GEAR SHIFT IS STUCK IN DRIVE I CAN NOT PUT IT IN PARK IF I TURN MY CAR OFF IT WON'T CRANK BACK UP PLEASE HELP I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AN THIS IS MY EVERYDAY CAR
DRIVING CAR FOR NO LONGER THAN 45 MINUTES. WHEN APPROACHING A GREEN LIGHT MY CAR WOULD NOT ACCELERATE. THE LIGHT TURNED RED SO I HAD TO COME TO A STOP. AS I DID, ALL MY DASH LIGHTS CAME ON AND MY CAR SPUTTERED. THE CAR THEN TURNED OFF. I TRIED TO RESTART, BUT NOTHING. IT BEGAN TO SMOKE BADLY AND I RUSHED OUT OF MY VEHICLE. THERE WAS A COP, CONVENIENTLY CLOSE, WHO STOPPED AND POURED WATER WHERE THE SMOKE WAS COMING FROM. IT CONTINUED TO SMOKE BUT NOT AS BAD AS BEFORE. THE CAR WOULD NOT TURN OVER STILL AND I WAS FORCED TO PAY TO HAVE MY CAR TOWED OUT OF THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. AFTER SITTING, WITH ENGINE OFF, THERE IS STILL A STING BURNT SMELL COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD AND INSIDE MY CAR.
THERE IS METAL IN THE BOTTOM OF THE ENGINE, THERE IS NO SLUDGE BUILD UP AND THE ENGINE HAS LESS THAN 90,000 MILES ON IT.  *TR
SINCE ABOUT 40K MILES MY STEERING HAS CLICKED, LOCKED, AND MISSED AND HAS GOTTEN WORSE TO THE POINT THAT I HAVE ALMOST BEEN IN A FEW WRECKS FROM INABILITY TO CONTROL STEERING. A MECHANIC FRIEND OF MINE TOLD ME THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THIS AND TO CALL KIA OF CHATTANOOGA (WHO I PURCHASED FROM) TO LOOK INTO IT ALONG WITH OTHER RECALLS I MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT BEFORE TAKING A TRIP ACCROSS COUNTRY WITH MY SON. I HAVE TRIED CALLING AND THE DEALERSHIP HEARS RECALL AND HANGS UP ON ME. I WAS ABLE TO LEAVE ONE VOICEMAIL FOR THE MANAGER BUT WAS NEVER CONTACTED BACK AND CONTINUE TO BE HUNG UP ON. MY CONCERN IS MOSTLY WITH THE STEERING AND POSSIBLE BEARINGS WITH ENGINE. STEERING WILL CLICK EVEN AT A STAND STILL, LOCKS AND MISSES WHILE IN MOTION RATHER BADLY. THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE AROUND 40K MILES. UNSURE OF ANY OTHER SAFETY RELATED RECALLS AS I HAD MOVED MULTIPLE TIMES AND BELIVE THAT IS WHY I DID NOT GET LETTERS.
MOST RECENTLY WHILE DRIVING MY CAR WITH VEHICLE IN MOTION ON CITY STREET (A STRAIGHT ROAD) IT ALL OF A SUDDEN DROPS POWER AND I AM UNABLE TO GET THE CAR TO ACCELERATE WITHOUT PUSH DOWN VERY HARD ON THE PEDAL UNTIL IT FINALLY DECIDES TO SPEED UP, ONCE THIS OCCURS THE TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT APPEARS ON THE DASH AND DOES NOT DISAPPEAR AND WILL NOT DISAPPEAR UNTIL THE CAR IS SHUT OFF AND RESTARTED AND THE LOSS OF POWER CONTINUES TO HAPPEN UNTIL THE CAR IS POWERED OFF. AFTER REALIZING THIS ISSUE I TURNED OFF THE CAR AND LET IT SIT A FEW MINUTES AND WHEN I POWERED BACK ON AND DROVE AGAIN THE SAME ISSUE OCCURRED AND THE TRACTION LIGHT REAPPEARED ON MY DASH. I AM CONCERNED THIS COULD BE A FAULTY PROGRAMMING ISSUE THAT IS TELLING THE CAR THE TRACTION IS NEEDED WHEN IT IS IN FACT NOT. THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD AS THERE IS NO WAY TO PREDICT WHEN THIS POWER LOSS WILL HAPPEN AND DOES SO IN THE MIDDLE OF DRIVING WHICH SLOWS THE CAR WAY DOWN AND COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT AND ALSO HAVING TO CONTINUOUSLY KEEP THE ACCELERATOR DOWN UNTIL IT DECIDES TO REGAIN POWER IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT WILL SUDDENLY RAMP UP THE RPM AND TAKE OFF. THIS IS A MAJOR CONCERN AND COULD BE HAPPENING TO OTHER CONSUMERS.
2012 KIA OPTIMA EX WITH 48000 MILES NOW DRIVER-SIDE HEADLIGHT STOPPED WORKING, SO AS OF NOW I AM DRIVING WITH PASSENGER SIDELIGHT IN COMBINATION WITH PARKING LIGHTS. BUYING KIA OPTIMA IS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE I HAVE EVER DONE, IT SEEMS EVERY MONTH SOMETHING GOES WRONG WITH THIS VEHICLE. SURPRISINGLY NHTSA HAS NOT TAKEN ANY ACTION AS PER KIA OPTIMA WELL KNOWN DEFECTS.
I HAVE HAD MULTIPLE ISSUES WITH MY 2012 KIA OPTIMA HYBRID FOR THE PAST 3-4 YEARS. THE TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN REPLACED AT 74K MI. NUMEROUS OCCASIONS CAR LOST POWER ON THE HIGHWAY. TAKEN CAR IN TO KIA DEALER EACH TIME AND THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. MY CAR STALLED OUT 1 MONTH AGO ON THE FREEWAY AND TOWED TO THE DEALER. NOW AT 125K MI DEALER IS TELLING ME MY ENGINE IS SEIZED, HYBRID BATTERY AND REGULAR BATTERY ARE DEAD.  AND ALSO REPLACED THE EMC FOR $2500 PRIOR TO FIGURING OUT THE ENGINE/BATTERY'S WERE DEAD.
WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY MY 2012 KIA OPTIMA HYBRID SLOWED DOWN TO 45MPH AND ENGINE STARTED TO MAKE NOISES.  THIS CAME WITH NO MECHANICAL WARNING, NO "CHECK ENGINE SOON" OR OTHER WARNING LIGHTS, AND HAD BEEN DRIVING PERFECTLY BEFORE IT WAS PARKED.  CHECKED OIL AND OIL LEVEL WAS PERFECT.  CALLED MECHANIC AND HE ASKED ME TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT OIL.  OIL HAD SMALL SHINY METAL SHAVINGS ON STICK THAT TRANSFERRED TO FINGERS WHEN RUBBED.  HAD CAR TOWED OVER 30 MILES TO NEAREST KIA DEALERSHIP.  CAR WAS DIAGNOSED WITH "ENGINE FAILURE" DUE TO ROD END BEARINGS.  I AM THE 2ND OWNER OF THIS CAR THE I BOUGHT FROM A MASTER MECHANIC AT A LEXUS DEALERSHIP.  WE ARE VERY METICULOUS AND TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF OUR VEHICLES.  THIS IS NOT A OWNER PROBLEM.  DEALERSHIP WANTS $10,000 FOR A NEW MOTOR, $4,000 FOR A USED (ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NONE CURRENTLY B/C THERE IS A SHORTAGE), OR $6,000 TO REBUILD CURRENT MOTOR.  SERVICE MANAGER WAS "SURPRISED" TO HEAR ABOUT THE METAL FLAKES AS THEY DIDN'T SEE THAT DURING THE DIAGNOSES.  BOTH KIA DEALER AND KIA CORP ARE STANDING BEHIND THE NO RECALL ON HYBRIDS.  SAID ALTHOUGH THE ENGINE IS THE SAME, THEY WERE MADE IN DIFFERENT FACTORIES, BUT COULD HAVE SHARED THE SAME PARTS. SERVICE MANAGER STATED, "YOU HAVE A LOT OF MILES ON THIS CAR"......146K.......I MEAN, IF I CAN NOT TRUST TO GET 150K OUT OF A KIA WHY WOULD I EVER WANT TO PURCHASE ONE AGAIN??? I ASKED HIM TO EXPLAIN HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN AND HIS RESPONSE WAS, "IT IS A MECHANICAL PIECE OF EQUIPMENT".  KIA NEEDS TO STOP PUTTING BLAME ON ITS OWNERS AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OF THEIR FAULTILY ENGINES FOR THE HYBRIDS AS THEY HAVE ON THE NON-HYBRID MODELS.  THERE ARE TOO MANY OTHER COMPLAINS HAVING THE SAME RESULTS AND STORIES FOR THIS TO BE AN OWNER PROBLEM. IT HAS BEEN A MONTH NOW, AND NO ONE IS BUDGING.
CAR DRIVES WITH LOOSE STEERING AND CLUNKING NOISE THAT FAIRFAX KIA REFUSES TO TEST DRIVE IT LONG ENOUGH TO HEAR. JERKS LEFT SUSPENSION ON ROUGH PAVEMENT  ON LEFT SIDE ONLY. THERE ARE LOTS OF BIG BOLTS ON THE LEFT STRUT AND I BELIEVE THESE BOLTS ARE EITHER DANGEROUSLY LOOSE OR THE STRUT ITSELF IS BROKEN. NOISE IS SUTTLE. HAVE COMPLAINED 3 TIMES TO DEALER.

WHEN STREERING THE VEHICLE, IN MOTION OR STILL, THE STEERING WHEEL MAKES A CLICKING SOUND. GOING OVER ANY BUMP IT RATTLES N SHAKES.
ON APRIL 5TH 2017, MY KIA OPTIMA STARTED TO MAKE A HORRIBLE SOUND. I WAS ON HWY 26 HEADED INTO PORTLAND OR. GOING THROUGH THE TUNNEL, AS I WAS GOING INTO THE TUNNEL THE HORRIBLE KNOCKING NOISE STARTED. THERE WAS CARS IN FRONT OF ME AND CARS BEHIND ME. THIS WAS AT 4:30 AM..  ALL THE LIGHTS ON THE DASH CAME ON, I HAD NO BRAKES, NO STEERING AND NO WAY TO ACCELERATE. DRIFTED TO THE SIDE AND HAD IT TOWED.
I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK AT A SPEED OF 45 MPH WHEN I HEARD SOME KNOCKING. AS I SLOWED TO AN INTERSECTION THE NOISE STOPPED UNTIL I ACCELERATED ONCE AGAIN.  GOT BACK UP TO 40-45 MPH AND ALL THE ENGINE LIGHTS CAME ON AND THE CAR STALLED. I WAS ABLE TO COAST TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD I WAS ON DURING RUSH HOUR. NOT REAL SAFE!  AT WHICH POINT THE CAR STARTED SMOKING AND SMELLING LIKE AN ELECTRICAL FIRE. I OPENED THE HOOD AND WHITE SMOKE WAS POURING OUT. THE VEHICLE WAS THEN TOWED TO KIA DEALERSHIP AND THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WAS ALREADY CLOSED.  I CALLED IN THE MORNING AND ASKED ABOUT THE ELECTRICAL SMELL.  HE SAID IS MOST LIKELY A BLOWN MOTOR.??? HE DIDN'T LOOK AT THE VEHICLE YET AND TOLD ME IT'S A BLOWN ROD IN THE MOTOR?? LATER THAT DAY I STOPPED INTO THE KIA DEALERSHIP TO SEE IF IT WAS LOOKED AT YET.  THEY TOLD ME IT WON'T BE LOOKED AT UNTIL TOMORROW.  HE DID SAY THAT HE WENT OUT TO SEE IF IT WOULD START AND SAID IT DIDN'T TURN OVER AND HE CAN GUARANTEE IT'S THE BLOWN ROD.  THAT'S WITHOUT A MECHANIC LOOKING AT IT.  KIA KNOWS THESE ENGINES ARE CRAP AND IS CHOOSING TO GIVE PEOPLE THE RUN AROUND. I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF THE CAR AND HE FIRST COULDN'T FIND ME IN THE COMPUTER.  THAT WAS THE FIRST THING I SHOWED HIM WHEN I WALKED IN THE DOOR WAS MY COPY FROM THE DEALERSHIP. ALL OF A SUDDEN HE FOUND ME IN THE SYSTEM.  HE ALSO SAID SINCE I SERVICE THE CAR'S OIL MYSELF I HAVE TO PROVIDE ALL THE RECORDS WHEN I PURCHASED OIL AND FILTERS OTHERWISE THE 100K WARRANTY WOULD BE VOID.  WE DON'T KEEP THE RECEIPTS OF ALL THAT FOR 4 YEARS!  IT'S FACTORY DEFECT JUST LIKE THE HYUNDAI SONATA'S.THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A KNOWN ISSUE AND IT'S SAD THAT KIA IS PUTTING THE BLAME ON THE CUSTOMERS INSTEAD OF TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR A FACTORY DEFECT. NO CAR WITH 74K MILES ON IT WITH PROPER MAINTENANCE SHOULD HAVE THE ENGINE JUST BLOW!  MY 2005 SUBURBAN WITH 150K RUNS GREAT!    THANKS,    JEFF
2012 KIA OPTIMA CAUGHT FIRE WHILE DRIVING 45 MPH & WAS UNABLE TO ACCELERATE/BRAKE. RECENTLY WAS TAKEN FOR SERVICE WITH NO ITEMS THAT WOULD CAUSE THE ISSUE...UPDATED 10/04/16 *BF   *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 KIA OPTIMA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE THE DRIVER WAS DRIVING AT 65 MPH, THE STEERING WHEEL BEGAN TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY WITH A LOUD NOISE. THE CONTACT COASTED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. THE CONTACT WAS ABLE TO RESUME DRIVING. THE FAILURE RECURRED TWICE.

"TAKATA RECALL"  I HAVE A RATHER NEW KIA OPTIMA. AT 70,000 MILES MY HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP COMPLETELY WENT OUT. THIS AFFECTED MY ABILITY TO START THE CAR AND ACCELERATE AS IT WS VERY HESITANT AND SHAKY. THE CAR WAS STATIONARY WHEN I REALIZED THE PROBLEM. I WAS ATTEMPTING TO START THE CAR AND REALIZED THAT IT TOOK A VERY LONG TIME TO START. AFTER REALIZING THIS, I IMMEDIATELY TOOK MY CAR TO A MECHANIC TO HAVE IT INSPECTED AND TOLD THAT THE HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP WENT OUT. I ASKED HOW IT HAPPENED AND HE INFORMED ME THAT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH MY DRIVING AND THAT IT IS VERY LIKELY THE PRODUCT OF A FAULTY FUEL PUMP BECAUSE THAT USUALLY DOESN'T HAPPEN WITH A CAR WITH ONLY 70,000 MILES ON IT.
THE VEHICLE HIT 63,000 MILES DURING THIS INCIDENT. AS I WAS MERGING ONTO THE EXPRESSWAY AT 50MPH, I GOT THE VEHICLE TO 60MPH AND THE SPEEDOMETER GAUGE FROZE AT 60MPH.

WHILE TRAVELING FROM KNOXVILLE TN.WE NOTICED THE SMELL OF GASOLINE WHILE TRAVELING ON I-75.AS WE CONTINUED ON THE SMELL WENT AWAY.WE REFUELED IN SWEETWATER TN. AND CONTINUED ON.AT A REDLIGHT IN MADISONVILLE WE NOTICED THE SMELL AGAIN.I PULLED INTO A WENDYS PARKING LOT AND CHECKED BENEATH THE HOOD.THERE WAS NO GAS SMELL OR LEAKS.WE CONTINUED ON TO HWY 68.NEAR FARNER TN. THE CAR HAD A HOT SMELL AND WITHIN A FEW SECONDS WENT UP IN FLAMES.WE PULLED ONTO A SIDE ROAD AND EXITED THE VEHICLE.THERE WAS NO WARNING LIGHTS, AND THE CAR DID NOT MISS OR SHUT OFF.NO WARNING WHATSOEVER.WE WERE ABLE TO GET OUT ONLY.FLAMES CONSUMED THE CAR IMMEDIATELY AFTER WE EXITED THE VEHICLE.  *TR
I WAS DRIVING THE 2012 KIA OPTIMA AND TURNED A CORNER AND MY KNEE PRESSED ON DRIVERS DOOR AND THE INTERIOR DOME LIGHT CAME ON AND THIS HAS CONTINUED TO HAPPEN EVER SINCE.  IT IS AN ISSUE WHEN IT HAPPENS AT NIGHT.  WE HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO A DEALERSHIP WHERE THEY SAID DOOR WAS NOT ADEQUATELY INSTALLED.  IT WAS FIXED FOR A FEW WEEKS AND NOW IT IS DOING IT AGAIN.  THE BATTERY COMPLETELY DIED A FEW MONTHS AGO BECAUSE OF THE SENSOR WHICH WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO LOCK THE DOOR.
GAS PEDAL WOULD NOT WORK. AVIS PUTS RUBBER FLOOR MATS OVER CLOTH FLOOR MATS THAT HAVE HOOKS EMBEDDED IN TIME TO HOLD THE FACTORY FLOOR MATS IN PLACE. I DID NOT KNOW THEY HAD DID THIS. OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL HOURS OF DRIVING THE RUBBER FLOOR MAT SLID FORWARD UNDER THE GAS PEDAL RENDERING IT INOPERABLE; I COASTED OVER TO SIDE OF ROAD AND DISCOVERED THE PROBLEM, PULLED THE RUBBER FLOORMAT BACK TOWARDS THE FRONT SEAT AND IT HAPPENED A 2ND TIME A FEW HOURS LATER WHERE I LOST COMPLETE USE OF THE GAS PEDAL SO I PUT THE RUBBER MATS IN THE TRUNK. I REPORTED THIS TO AVIS. AN AVIS REP SAYS THIS IS A STANDARD CORPORATE POLICY SO THEY CAN SAVE WEAR ON THE CLOTH RUG STYLE FLOOR MATS. I ASKED THEM TO REEXAMINE THEIR CORPORATE POLICY. I HOPE YOUR AGENCY CAN REVIEW THIS PRACTICE AND MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO AVIS. WITH ALL THE ISSUE SURROUNDING CAR ACCELERATOR PEDALS AND AFTER MARKET FLOOR MATS JAMMING THEM IT SEEMS THEY HAVE TAKEN LEAVE OF COMMON SENSE.  *TR

I bought this car for 6000$ in the month of November. I checked everything while buying the car. I did checked the oil level the engine sound its condition and transmission. I did the oil change myself after buying and once in the middle. Suddenly on Feb 16th it got stopped on the middle of the highway. After lot research I see there are thousands of complaints for the kia optima’s and Hyundai Sonata’s for their failure GDI Engines. I towed to dealership whether they could help replacing engine. They haven’t. I see there are no recalls on this car. I would like to complain regarding this incident and justice should be provided to me
My vehicle received a new engine due to a component failure, which there was a recall specifically describing the failure, recall 17v224 (SC147). After the new engine replacement, April 2024, while driving my car I began to notice a faint smell of gas with inside my car. As time passed the smell grew heavier. Drove the car to the Pueblo Colorado Dealership and had the service department take a look to confirm the leak. It was confirmed and one of the service personnel tried to torque the bolt tighter and that did not stop the leak. I was told by one of the service personnel that it was not covered under warranty and the cost would be mine out of pocket to fix. I found out this fuel leak is a recall (SC172), vehicles that received an engine replacement under previous recall 17v224 (SC147). ("Kia Motors America, Inc., pursuant to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, is conducting a Safety Recall Campaign to inspect and, if necessary, replace the High Pressure Fuel Pipe on certain 2011–2014 MY Kia Optima, 2012-2014 MY Kia Sorento, and 2011-2013 MY Kia Sportage vehicles that received an engine replacement under Recall No. 17v224 (SC147). The remedy for the previous recall may not have been properly performed, and in some cases, the high pressure fuel pipe may have been damaged, misaligned or improperly torqued during the engine replacement procedure, allowing fuel to leak. Leaking fuel increases the risk of fire."). I have spoken to the Dealership and they do not recognize this recall as it is not showing up in their data system. I have spoken to the Kia Corporation and I have gotten nowhere.  This was issued by your department and is recognized by KIA corporation but the Pueblo Colorado KIA dealership states it is not in their system as a recall. My car has been parked after notifying both parties of this issue since December 19, 2024.  Your NHTSA: Part 573 Safety Recall Report 18V-907 Manufacturer Recall No. : SC172
In May 2024, I took my 2013 Kia Optima (2.0L T-GDI) to my local dealership to have several recalls completed, including SC284QF (Hydraulic Electronic Control Unit). The dealership completed the recalls and I have a receipt showing all three recalls were completed.  On Sep 12 2024 I received a recall notice stating the recall SC284QF had NOT been completed and to contact my dealership to schedule this recall repair.  I looked up the Kia Safety Recall Campain instruction, detailing the repair step-by-step. I then went to my vehicle fuse panel (where the recall repair was to be performed) and was able to verify the recall has NOT been completed, despite the Kia dealership claiming (and documenting) the recall as being complete. This recall states that the risk of not competing this recall is potential engine fire while being driven or parked. I park this vehicle inside my garage (attached to my house) and this could have caused a fire which could have endangered the lives of my family. I have attached the Kia Safety Recall Campain instructions as well as a photo of the affected fuse.
I've had my car since late 2018. A couple years after having I've noticed it's burning oil. I made an appt at Evansville Kia dealership & was called the day before appt to be told the excessive oil consumption test was not part of the warranty. I asked what am I suppose to do keep spending money on oil? The mechanic told me to keep topping it off til it quits, cause he said it's going to quit. How is this safe? Not knowing when & where you will be when something happens. My car is now using a quart or more of oil every 500 or so miles. This is ALOT of money out of pocket.
The contact owns a 2013 Kia Optima. The contact stated while her husband was driving at approximately 65 MPH on a hill, the vehicle started losing automotive power and suddenly stalled. There was no warning light illuminated. The vehicle was not able to be restarted and smoke was noticed emanating from the front area, near the engine compartment. The vehicle was towed to the contact residence. The contact indicated that while an independent mechanic tried to start the vehicle, he became aware that the vehicle was being overloaded and subsequently fire flames began to be noticed. The mechanic disconnected the alternator and informed the contact it was a manufacturing failure. The local dealer was contacted, however; they stated that it would not be repaired since it was not covered under warranty. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure; however, no assistance was provided. The failure mileage was approximately 100,000.
Kia issued a recall on engine do too failure but Kia give multiple excuses why they won’t replace from it has to be running to it has to have update first  or it can’t have more than150,000 miles! I need help with this KIA OWES me an engine. It shows 10 sales records at 2 different dealers and yet none of the recalls where repaired it show 1 recall on this website but if you call Kia they tell you it has 3,4 or 5 recalls and different excuses! I just won’t the engine I was promised!
The contact owns a 2013 Kia Optima. The contact received notification NHTSA Campaign Number: 23V652000 (Service Brakes, Hydraulic) however, the part to do the recall repair was not yet available. The contact stated that the manufacturer had exceeded a reasonable amount of time for the recall repair. The contact attempted to start the vehicle when it began clicking fast. The ABS warning lights and the Malfunction Indicator Lamp light was illuminated.  The vehicle was not taken to the dealer and was not repaired. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 91,000. VIN tool confirms part not available.
Rod bearing making a knocking noise. Car a month since i bought it.

SAME STORY OVER AND OVER 2013 WHITE PEARL PAINT GARAGE KEPT, NO ACCIDENTS AND PAINT IS LITERALLY CHIPPING AWAY SIDE OF THE CAR DOOR ROOF ABSOLUTELY APPALLING. KIA THE FACT THAT KIA HAS THOUSANDS OF THIS COLOR ON THE ROAD IS EMBARRASSING FOR ALL THE LOYAL CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE TO DRIVE THEM. KIA KNOWS THAT ALL OF THEM WERE PAINTED WITH NO PRIMER. CHEAP PAINT SPRAYED ON BARE METAL AND HAS LEFT ALL OF US STRANDED. THIS CLEARLY IS A COMPANY WITH NO INTEGRITY OR CARE FOR CUSTOMERS LET ALONE OUR LIVES .THIS NEEDS CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT
My car simply “just quit” leaving me stranded on the road.  I called my nearest Kia dealer who said it would be at least 6 weeks until they could see it.  Apparently according to a quick search, these cars are blowing engines rather regularly.   Why wasn’t there a recall before engines were blown?  Since my car is no longer covered under warranty, I’m expecting a hefty bill even though there’s an obvious defect.   Kia will not return my calls.
The hid headlights. Specifically low beams go dim.They are so dim you can not drive safely at night. Change the bulbs and still the same issue.My understanding the reflector housing on the projector gets worn out and does reduce the light output of low beams. This is a driving hazard at night.this issue affecting the sx and sxl models with hid projector headlights.
hybrid system warning safely stop and do not drive with some kind of brake warning and then the brakes were basically non existent. Could not brake had to coast to a stop in a neighborhood very scary
Steering coupler went bad. Steering wheel rattles, badly
My pearl white has been chipping since 2017 in multiple locations. Kia needs to be held responsible and rectify the situation.
Leak and/or cracked oil pan around the drain plug. Due to past issues regarding the crankshaft bearings I fear the oil consumption could assist in the issue. Also fear the oil leaking neak the exhaust and catalytic converter could ignite a fire beneath the vehicle. Vehicle has not been inspected by a dealership yet. And there have been no dash lights to indicate the problem. It was found while trying to investigate oil spots on ground beneath vehicle
The car stops in middle of road and turns off if I go over 20 MPH. It's happened twice in the middle of highway and I've had to get towed home. The engine light is on and blinking and I hear knocking sounds. My boyfriend has a code reader and he said when he hooked code reader up to car it showed the exact same code as the other kia optimas engine problems. This needs to be a recall!!
When we start the car Yellow colour Engine symbol pos up on the dashboard. It’s a engine related issue.
I started driving and the car just stopped working in the middle of the street. Many lights on the engine came on. I had to push the car into a street and it could've been so dangerous if I was on the busy road instead of a side street. We had the car towed and taken to a mechanic. We got the call and it turns out certain wires started leaking and it could've started an engine fire. No lights were on before until immediately it stopped working.
Engine seized up right after oil change. Went into limp mode on highway. Doesn't run
In 2013 we were driving to NC it was raining the steering just left the car completely un steerable thank God it had came back to be able to control the car ...told dealership about it they acted like I was crazy ....needless to say we don't drive it when it's raining ...if we get caught in rain we use extra caution and very slow speeds ..at this point it was a new car hadn't even had 150 miles on it
The contact owns a 2013 Kia Optima. The contact stated that the low-beam headlight was not providing proper illumination while driving, making it difficult to see the roadway. The contact took the vehicle to the local dealer however, the mechanic was unable to duplicate the failure. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer had been informed of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 176,000.
2013 KIA Optima Pearl White paint began chipping and flaking exposing bare metal to rust and corrosion.
The contact owns a 2013 Kia Optima. The contact stated that while driving at an undisclosed speed, fuel odor was detected but the contact did not see fuel leaking onto the ground. The contact's cousin, an independent mechanic, inspected under the engine cover and saw that there was fuel leaking on top of the engine block from a cracked fuel line. The dealer was made aware of the failure and scheduled an upcoming appointment for diagnosis. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 87,000.
The motor failed while I was driving. I was at a stop sign and was turning the corner and my car shut off. I tried to start the car and smoke was coming from the engine. I had to have my car towed home. No warning lamps came up prior to the engine shutting down.
Car engine died while leaving stop sign. Towed to a mechanic, they said the motor was seized & it seemed to be a recall issue so had it towed to Kia dealership. Waited a few days & never heard anything so called the dealership & they said it was a recall issue but they were denying it. Called corporate, confirmed it was a recall, still denied replacing the engine
THE CAR JUST SHUT-OFF WHILE IN MOTION AND WOULD NOT START AFTER THAT. THE CAR HAS 99,642 MILES ON IT. CAR WAS TOWED TO A KIA DEALERSHIP FOR DIAGNOSIS AND IT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT THE ENGINE HAD FAILED AND KIA IS NOT COVERING THE REPAIRS.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 KIA OPTIMA. THE CONTACT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 20V750000 (ENGINE) HOWEVER, THE PART TO DO THE RECALL REPAIR WAS UNAVAILABLE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE LOCAL DEALER KIA OF VACAVILLE LOCATED AT 651 ORANGE DR, VACAVILLE, CA 95687 WHERE IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THE SOFTWARE NEEDED TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE WAS NOT AVAILABLE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS CONTACTED AND CONFIRMED THAT THE SOFTWARE NEEDED WAS NOT YET AVAILABLE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE MANUFACTURER HAD EXCEEDED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THE RECALL REPAIR. THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE. PARTS DISTRIBUTION DISCONNECT.
THE VEHICLE'S ENGINE STALLED & SHUT OFF WITHOUT WARNING, WHILE I WAS DRIVING IN TRAFFIC.  IT GAVE ZERO PRIOR WARNING, THERE WERE NO WARNING LIGHTS, NO SPUTTERING, NO INDICATION OF AN ISSUE. AT THE TIME, IT HAD A QUARTER TANK OF GAS (AT LEAST THE GAUGE SAID SO).  AAA FILLED THE TANK AND WE RESTARTED THE VEHICLE, WITHOUT ISSUE.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP OUT OF CONCERN IT MAY HAPPEN AGAIN (ON THE FREEWAY WHERE IT COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT), AND THEY SAID IT'S A FAULTY TURBO CHARGER CAUSING A "LOSS OF POWER."  GIVEN THERE WERE NO ISSUES WHILE DRIVING IT TO THE DEALERSHIP, I'M NOT SURE I AGREE WITH THE "LOSS OF POWER."  BUT REGARDLESS, IF THE TURBO IS BAD, IT'S AMONG THOUSANDS OF OTHER 2013 KIA OPTIMAS WITH TURBO & ENGINE ISSUES THAT ARE ALL WAY TOO SIMILAR TO BE COINCIDENCE. THE DEALERSHIP WANTS ALMOST 4K TO REPLACE IT, WITHOUT ANY GUARANTEE IT'LL ACTUALLY FIX THE ENGINE STALLING ISSUE.
CAR HAS A BAD GAS FUME SMELL THAT COMES THROUGH THE VENT WHEN DRIVING CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON MOTOR HAS A LOUD TAPPING NOISE AND BURNS GAS QUICK
I WAS DRIVING ON A MAIN ROAD ABOUT 50 MILES AN HOUR WHEN CAR LOST ABILITY TO ACCELERATE, LIGHTS AND EVERYTHING WERE STILL ON. I WAS ABLE TO COAST TO A SIDE STREET TO PULL OVER AND PARK THE CAR. I SHUT IT OFF AND THEN WHEN I TRIED TO RESTART IT BLACK SMOKE WITH AN ELECTRICAL TYPE SMELL CAME FROM UNDER THE HOOD. KIA DEALERSHIP SAID MOTOR WAS SEIZED AND REPLACED IT UNDER A RECALL. THEN THEY SAID IT NEEDED FUEL PUMP AND BATTERY (WHICH BATTERY WAS ONLY 6 MONTHS OLD), SO I HAD BOTH REPLACED. I DROVE FOR 2 DAYS AND HAD TROUBLE STARTING THE CAR SO I TOOK BACK TO DEALERSHIP. THEY SAID IT NEEDED A STARTER AND AN ELECTRICAL ASSESSMENT FOR A SHORT, AS STARTER BEGAN SMOKING WITH THE VEHICLE NOT EVEN RUNNING. NOW THEY ARE SAYING IT NEEDS A NEW JUNCTION BOX/FUSE BOX OVER $2900 AND MAY HAVE BEEN RELATED TO OTHER PROBLEMS BUT NOT COVERED AND I WILL HAVE TO PAY. I HAVE ALREADY PAID $900+ DOLLARS FOR FUEL PUMP, I EXCHANGED THE BATTERY WHERE I ORIGINALLY BOUGHT IT, AND $493 FOR STARTER. I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY THE JUNCTION BOX WOULD RANDOMLY FAIL OR SHORT AND NEED REPLACEMENT, UNLESS IT WAS PART OF THE ORIGINAL BLACK SMOKE ELECTRICAL SMELL THAT HAPPENED WHEN ENGINE SEIZED IN THE FIRST PLACE.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 KIA OPTIMA. THE CONTACT STATED WHILE DRIVING 35 MPH, THE VEHICLE STALLED WITHOUT WARNING. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DRIVABLE. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC AND WAS INFORMED THAT THE ENGINE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED NOR REPAIRED AS OF YET. A DEALER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE VIN WAS ASSOCIATED WITH NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 17V224000 (ENGINE AND ENGINE COOLING) AND NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 20V100000 (FUEL SYSTEM, GASOLINE). THE MANUFACTURER HAD NOT BEEN INFORMED OF FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 116,000.
WHILE DRIVING MY CAR AT AN AVERAGE SPEED, THE CAR SUDDENLY STARTED TO JERK AND WOULD NOT ACCELERATE, THEN NEXT THING I KNOW I HEARD A KNOCKING NOISE IN THE ENGINE.
ON MAY 10, 2020 @7:32 AM I  WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK AND CAME TO A STOP LIGHT WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN MY CAR STALLED AND ALL THE LIGHTS ON THE DASHBOARD TURNED ON. I PULLED OVER AND STARTED THE BACK UP AND MADE IT HOME. THE NEXT DAY I DROVE ABOUT 10 MILES AND THE CAR SEEMED FINE BUT AS I GET TO THE STOP LIGHT THE CAR STARTED MAKING A GRINDING SOUND LIKE METAL AND I COULDN'T ACCELERATE SO I PULLED OVER AND THE CAR DIED IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA. THE NEXT MORNING I CALL AAA  AND HAD CAR TOWED BACK TO MY HOME. THE NEXT DAY AAA CAME OUT AGAIN AND CHECKED MY BATTERY, STARTER,  AND SYSTEM SOMETHING AND THEY WERE ALL WORKING GOOD. I CALLED STEVE SCHMITT KIA ON HALLS FERRY ROAD AND ASKED WAS THERE ANOTHER RECALL ON MY CAR FOR THE ENGINE, THE LADY PAUSED AND THEN SAID "WE DON'T HAVE THE PARTS YET, " SHE THEN SAID HOLD ON AND CAME BACK AND SAID "WE DON'T HAVE ANY RECALLS ON THIS CAR. ON OCTOBER THE 1 , 2019 I TOOK MY CAR TO KIA FOR A RECALL ON MY MOTOR AND LOOKING AT THE RECEIPT THEY REPLACED ELEMENT AIR FILTER,  ADJUSTED ALIGNMENT FOUR WHEELS, MOUNT AND BALANCE 2 TIRES, REPLACED CABIN AIR FILTER PLUS A OIL CHANGE WHICH I PAID FOR. MY CAR HAS BEEN SITTING SINCE MAY 13, 2020 . I FREQUENTLY GO OUT AND CHECK IT AND IT STARTS AND I HEAR A KNOCKING SOUND .( ENGINE FAIL)  *TR  *BF *AS
ENGINE STARTED MAKING A KNOCKING NOISE -  *TR
WHEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE THE STEERING WHEEL IS MAKING A CLACKING NOISE. THE STEERING WHEEL IS LOOSE
WHILE DRIVING THERE WAS A SUDDEN KNOCKING IN THE ENGINE AND THEN THE ENGINE SEIZED LOSING PRESSURE THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD HAD TO PUSH IT OFF TO SIDE WOULD NOT START BACK UP  THIS HAPPENED 300 MILES AFTER LAST OIL CHANGE CAR DISABLED DUE TO ENGINE FAILURE.
I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AROUND 70 MPH, PRESSED THE GAS PEDAL AND THEN THE ENGINE ACCELERATED AND THEN DECELERATED BACK TO ACCELERATING. BY THAT TIME, THE CAR LIGHTS ON THE DASHBOARD TURN ON AND THE GAS PEDAL WOULD NOT ACCELERATE THE CAR ANYMORE. THE CAR SLOWLY STARTED DECELERATING ON THE HIGHWAY, WHERE I MANAGED TO GET OFF OF THE HIGHWAY INTO A DIP ON A BIG STREET. HAD IT TOWED BECAUSE THE CAR'S ENGINE WOULD NOT START ANYMORE, BUT THE LIGHTS AND RADIO INSIDE WOULD TURN ON. I SAW OTHER PEOPLE ONLINE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEM AND HOW THERE IS A RECALL ON CERTAIN VEHICLES, BUT WHEN I SEARCHED UP MY CAR'S VIN NUMBER, IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE ON THE RECALL LIST.
ON INTERSTATE 675 NORTH-GA CAR STALLED, LOST POWER TO THE ENGINE, EPS LIGHT, CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, OIL LIGHT CAME ON ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL, NO POWER STEERING. I HAD TO CROSS TWO LANES OF INTERSTATE TRAFFIC TO TRY TO MAKE IT SAFELY TO THE SHOULDER.  MY CAR WOULDN'T TURN OVER OR START. I LET THE CAR SIT FOR AN HOUR AND TRIED AGAIN TO START IT. I RECEIVED NO NOTICE OF ANY RECALLS FROM THE DEALER OR THE MANUFACTURER. IT WAS A DANGEROUS SITUATION TO BE IN ON THE INTERSTATE OR ANYWHERE FOR THAT MATTER.
THE VIN DID NOT GET THAT THIS IS AN OPTIMA HYBRID, WHICH ISN'T IN THE RECALL, SC145, BUT HAS SIMILAR SYMPTOMS, ONLY KIA OPTIMAS.  DRIVING AT 75MPH, I TRIED TO ACCELERATE TO GET AROUND A CAR AND I FELT/STARTED HEARING ROD KNOCK.  AT IDLE THE SOUND IS WORSENED ONLY BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  I'M WORRIED THAT THE ENGINE COULD HAVE SEIZED AND CREATED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  IT WAS DIAGNOSED AS ROD FAILURE AT THE KIA DEALERSHIP.   THE CAR HAS 116,000 MILES AND IS JUST OUTSIDE OF THE WARRANTY.  THEY DON'T WANT TO HELP OUT IN ANY WAY BECAUSE IT'S NOT PART OF THE RECALL PROGRAM.
MY BAKE TAIL LIGHT KEEP MOISTURE AND HOLDS WATER WHEN IT RAINS, WHICH HAS CAUSED ME TO REPLACE BAKE LIGHT OFTEN. THE SEALS ON THE LIGHTS AREN'T AIR TIGHT. IS THERE A RECALL ON THIS.
WAS DRIVING VEHICLE 65 MPH ON INTERSTATE HWY WHEN ENGINE SHUT OFF WITHOUT WARNING OF ANY KIND. VEHICLE WILL NOT RESTART AND WAS TOWED
I WAS DRIVING FROM WOBURN MA ON NEW BOSTON ROAD HEADED TO WILMINGTON MA  AND MY CAR SEEMED TO SHUT DOWN I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER OFF THE STREET NEXT TO A CURB LOCATION 147 NEW BOSTON RD. I TRIED TO START MY CAR PRESSING THE PUSH BUTTON START ONLY LIGHTS CAME ON ON THE OIL HAS ENGINE BATTERY... WHILE STILL SITTING IN THE CAR I WAS TRYING TO MAKE SOME CALLS   I SMELLED A BURNING SMELL I NOTICED SMOKE COMING FROM THE FRONT OF THE CAR. THE SMOKE INCREASED RAPIDLY I EXITED THE CAR CALLED 911. WHILE WAITING FOR HELP TO ARRIVE I  GRABBED SOME ITEMS FROM THE GLOVE BOX AND BACK SEAT THE FRONT OF THE CAR   AT THAT POINT FLAMES WERE COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD THE FLAMES ESCALATED TO POP THE HOOD A LARGE FIRE HAD IGNIGHTED FROM THE ENGINE AREA   THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PUT OUT THE FIRE. A TOW TRUCK TOWED THE CAR AWAY.
WHILE DRIVING OFF THE INTERSTATE THE KIA OPTIMA STARTED TO SMOKE AND WHEN PULLED OVER FLAMES STARTED TO COME FROM THE HOOD(CAR STILL ONE). THE FLAMES ONLY GOT BIGGER AND EVENTUALLY TOTALED THE VEHICLE .
ABOUT THREE MONTHS AFTER HAVING MY ENGINE REPLACED DUE TO A RECALL, IT CAUGHT ON FIRE WHILE I WAS DRIVING.
I THOUGHT MY KEY FOB STOPPED WORKING I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP HAD IT TESTED AND THEY SAID IT WAS FINE. THEY SAID IT HAD TO BE THE WIRING IN MY CAR FOR MY ALARM SYSTEM. ABOUT 4 MONTHS AGO I WAS GOING TO GET INTO MY CAR. I PUT MY KEY IN THE DOT UNLOCKED IT PULLED MY DOOR OPEN AND MY CAR ALARM STARTED GOING OFF. I TRIED EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO GET IT TO TURN OFF. FINALLY AFTER ABOUT 3 MINUTES IT JUST STOPPED. NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN UNTIL A WEEK AGO. SAME SCENARIO. THEN 2 DAYS AGO SAME SCENARIO. I'M READ ONLINE IT'S A COMMON ISSUE PEOPLE HAVE AND I'M WONDERING IF IT'S RELATED TO THE CAR FIRE THING AND WIRES SHORTING OUT.
MY CAR (KIA OPTIMA 2013) WAS PART OF THE RECALL IN 2017 AND IN DECEMBER 2017 MY CAR CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP ON A VERY BUSY FREEWAY IN CALIFORNIA.  I HAD MY CAR TOW TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THEY REPLACED MY ENGINE BECAUSE IT WAS PART OF THE RECALL.  9 MOS LATER SEPTEMBER 16TH 2018 MY FIANCEE WAS DRIVING DOWN A HILL ON A CALIFORNIA FREEWAY AND HE HAD NO BRAKES AND OTHER DRIVERS WERE HONKING AND YELLING YOUR CAR IS ON FIRE.  HE USED THE EMERGENCY BRAKES TO TRY AND SLOW DOWN TO EXIT THE FREEWAY HE WAS PICKING UP SPEED BECAUSE HE WAS GOING DOWN HILL THE CAR WAS WAS STARTING TO FILL UP WITH SMOKE.  HE WAS HOPING THE WINDOWS WOULD GO DOWN AND THEY DID HE START EXITING FREEWAY PUSHING ON THE EMERGENCY BRAKE SLOWING DOWN APPROACHING A CURB TURNING THE WHEEL TOWARDS THE CURB STILL ROLLING HE JUMPS OUT OFT THE CAR RUNNING AWAY FROM VEHICLE. JUST SECONDS AFTER HE GETS OUT  HE SAID THE CAR JUST WAS IN FLAMES BURNING FROM THE ENGINE TIRES POPPING AND WINDOWS BREAKING OUT.   THE CAR HAS ONLY 8,000 MILES ON NEW MOTOR THE WHOLE CAR HAD 108,000 THE WAS A 2013 5 YEARS OLD
MY AIRBAG LIGHT WENT IS ON AND MY HORN ISN'T WORKING.  SOUNDS LIKE ITS A SIMILAR ISSUE TO NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 18V363000 AND YET MY VIN ISN'T INCLUDED.
MY PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED 5 SEPARATE TIMES.  MY CAR WON'T CRANK AFTER SITTING ANYWHERE FROM 2 MINUTES TO ALL NIGHT.  I STOP AND PARK MY CAR, PUT GEAR IN PARK AND PRESS THE BUTTON TO STOP THE ENGINE.  WHEN I TRY TO GET BACK IN IF MY DOOR IS LOCKED, SOMETIMES I CAN'T GET IN WITH MY KEY FOB.  I HAVE TO OPEN THE HOOD, CHARGE THE BATTERY AND THEN THE KEY FOB WORKS.  IF MY CAR IS NOT LOCKED, I GET IN AND NO LIGHTS COME ON, PRESSING THE START ENGINE BUTTON DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  I CANNOT OPERATE ANY PART OF THE CAR, TRUNK, LIGHTS, SEATS, WINDOWS, IT IS ALL DEAD.  THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY BATTERY.  WHY IS THIS NOW HAPPENING?  I HAVE AROUND 42,000 MILES AND I HAVE A KIA OPTIMA 2013 WITH ALL BELLS AND WHISTLES.  I LOVE MY CAR BUT AS A WIDOW, I DON'T WANT TO GET STRANDED SOMEWHERE WITH A DEAD BATTERY / ENGINE.  WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE THE PROBLEM.  I HAVE BEEN READING THAT A LOT OF OTHER OWNERS ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS.  WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO?  THE DEALERSHIPS JUST CHARGE EXORBITANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND THE PROBLEMS STILL ARE FIXED.  SHOULD THERE NOT BE A RECALL ON PROBLEM, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT IS AN ELECTRICAL ISSUE?
ON AUGUST 17TH , 2017 AFTER MAKING A BROKEN U TURN, I DROVE MY 2013 KIA OPTIMA ONTO A ROAD  AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED, TO FLOW INTO TRAFFIC, AND HIT A CURB THAT I BELIEVED I WAS CLEAR OF. I SUFFERED WHIPLASH AND SEVERE PAIN FROM MY ACCELERATOR FOOT UP TO MY SHOULDERS AS BOTH HANDS WERE ON THE STEERING WHEEL. I HAVE HAD TO TAKE OFF MANY DAYS TO REST SINCE THEN. AFTER A VISIT TO THE DEALER WHERE I REPORTED THE ACCIDENT, THE REP SUGGESTED THAT THE CAR SHOULD HAVE A FRONT CAMERA.  AFTER THE ACCIDENT I BEGAN TO HEAR AND FEEL NOISE AND EXCESSIVE PLAY IN THE STEERING WHEEL, AND TOOK THE CAR TO MY MECHANIC WHO DISCOVERED THE FAULTY PART, THE FLEXIBLE COUPLER AND RECOMMENDED I TAKE IT TO THE DEALER TO HAVE THE RECALLED PART THAT CAUSED ACCIDENT REPLACED. I HAD HAD MY SUSPICION'S AS TO WHY THE CAR HAD NOT BEEN DRIVEN MUCH BY THE PREVIOUS OWNERS, AND THAT THE INACCURATE NAVIGATION MAY HAVE CAUSED THEM TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT, THAT WAS NEVER REPORTED.   I BELIEVE I HAVE CASE AGAINST THE DEALER AND THE MANUFACTURE, FOR MY PAIN AND SUFFERING. AS A TBI SUFFERER THIS LAST EVENT IS CAUSING MAJOR COMPLICATIONS; AND NOW DIZZINESS, DEPRESSION, UNCERTAINTY AND HEADACHES HAVE RETURNED.
I OWN A 2013 OPTIMA SXL. WHEN I AM PULLING OFF FAST OR PUNCHING IT AROUND 20MPH THE CAR DIES. LIKE I LOSE POWER, BUT THE RPMS ARE UP. FEELS LIKE I JAMMED THE BRAKES BUT I DON'T EVEN GET A ABS FEEL. I HAVE TO TAKE MY FOOT OFF THE GAS AND THEN SLOWLY HIT THE GAS. TIRE PRESSURE IS WHERE IT SUPPOSE TO BE. WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING IS TURNING OFF THE TRACTION CONTROL SO I FEEL SAFE HITTING THE GAS. IT'S REALLY BAD IN THE RAIN. IF I GO TO ACCELERATE AND NOT FAST IN THE RAIN IT DOES IT. I WENT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP TODAY AND OF COURSE THEY SAID THIS IS NORMAL. I DID SOME SEARCH ONLINE AND I FOUND A FORUM WHERE MULTIPLE OWNERS HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE. ONE OWNER HAD THE HYDRAULIC ABS ASSIST MODULE REPLACED AND ECU REPROGRAMMED UNDER WARRANTY. WHILE MOST CUSTOMERS LIKE MY SELF HAVE BROUGH THE CAR TO OUR LOCAL DEALERSHIP JUST FOR THEM TO CLIAM THE PROBLEM IS NORMAL. THE PART IS 1600.00 PLUS 900.00 IN LABOR. THIS SHOULD BE RECALLED SINCE IT BECAME A REAL DANGER SPECIALLY ON THE HIGHWAY. AS THE DIES UNDER ACCELERATION WHILE OVERTAKING.     PART NUMBER 58920-2T550

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 KIA OPTIMA. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 60 MPH, THE STEERING FAILED WITHOUT WARNING. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER, BUT THE FAILURE COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 12,000.
OPTIMA'S DRIVER'S-SIDE SEAT BELT STOPPED WORKING AND THE BACK SEAT MIDDLE SEAT BELT, (RARELY USED), STOPPED WORKING DUE TO INABILITY TO CLICK (LOCK) INTO PLACE. CAR IS A 2013 KIA OPTIMA GDI & IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION IN EVERY OTHER ASPECT SEEN & KNOWN.
WHILE SITTING AT A STOP SIGN, MY SUNROOF EXPLODED. THE ROOF WAS OPEN AND THE WEATHER WAS SUNNY AND APPROACHING 70*.
MY STEERING USED TO BE GREAT, WITH NO ISSUES. A FEW DAYS AGO MY STEERING WHEEL STARTED TO FIGHT ME WHILE I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK. STRAIGHT, TURNING LEFT, TURNING RIGHT, IT SEEMED TO FIGHT ME NO MATTER THE SITUATION. ALL OF A SUDDEN, ANY TINY BUMPS IN THE ROAD THAT THE CAR COMES INTO CONTACT WITH THROWS THE STEERING WHEEL A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. ALSO, THE CAR VEERS RIGHT WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL IS PERFECTLY STRAIGHT. MY NORMAL DRIVE BEFORE THIS INCIDENT WAS PHENOMENAL, WITH NO COMPLAINTS... THE CAR TOOK TINY BUMPS IN THE ROAD BUT IT WAS NOT FELT IN THE STEERING WHEEL. I TOOK THE CAR TO A DEALERSHIP AND THEY "FIXED" THE PROBLEM BY ALIGNING MY TIRES AND UPDATING THE ELECTRICAL POWER STEERING SETTINGS. I WAS EXCITED TO GET BACK INTO MY CAR WITH THE PROBLEM FIXED BUT ALL I NOTICED AFTERWARDS WAS THAT THE STEERING WHEEL IS TIGHTER WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS. THE TIGHTNESS OF THE WHEEL DOES NOT MAKE THE PROBLEMS AS NOTICEABLE, BUT THE CAR STILL DIRECTS RIGHT WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL IS STRAIGHT, THE STEERING WHEEL IS JUMPING WITH EVEN THE SLIGHTEST BUMPS IN THE ROAD, AND DRIVING THE VEHICLE IS STRESSFUL AND UNCOMFORTABLE AS I ALWAYS HAVE TO BE ON HIGH ALERT - THIS IS NOT PLEASANT WHEN I DRIVE LONG DISTANCES EVERYDAY FOR WORK. NEEDS TO BE FIXED!
WIFE'S 2013 OPTIMA HAS A VERY STIFF STEERING WHILE ON THE INTERSTATE. IT'S VERY HARD TO STAY IN A STRAIGHT LINE. ITS ALMOST AS IF THE STEERING LOCKS AT 12 OCLOCK AND IT BREAKS FREE AT ANY LEFT OR RIGHT MOVEMENT. OVER CORRECTING IS INEVITABLE. WE IGNORED IT FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS THINKING MAYBE IT'S JUST IN A "BREAK IN" STAGE. NOW AT 30K MILES IT'S THE EXACT SAME WAY. DEALER SAYS IT'S NORMAL AND WANTS ME TO PAY TO HAVE IT CHECKED OUT CAUSE THERE ARE NO RECALLS. IT'S VERY UNSAFE. I'M OBVIOUSLY NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM. I HOPE KIA MAN'S UP AND FIXES THIS PROBLEM.
IMPOSSIBLE TO HOLD THE CAR ON A STRAIGHT TRACK. WILL DRIFT LEFT,WHEN ATTEMPTING TO CORRECT TO A STRAIGHT TRACK,THE STEERING REQUIRES SO MUCH FORCE TO CORRECT THAT THE RESULT IS AN OVER CORRECTION TO THE RIGHT. THIS SCENARIO REPEATS FOREVER. THE STEERING STICKS AND CANNOT BE HELD IN A STRAIGHT LINE.  *TR
TL*  THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 KIA OPTIMA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING 70 MPH, THE SUN ROOF EXPLODED. THE FRACTURED GLASS PENETRATED THE VEHICLE INTERIOR HOWEVER, THE CONTACT DID NOT SUSTAIN ANY INJURIES. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE AND CURRENT MILEAGE WAS 22,000.
THE SUNROOF ON MY 2013 KIA OPTIMA EXPLODED OUT WARDS RAINING BROKEN GLASS DOWN ON MY HEARD.  THE CAR WAS NOT STRUCK BY ANY OBJECT AND NO CARS WERE AHEAD OF ME ON THE ROAD.  THERE WAS A SLIGHT CREAKING NOISE AND THEN A VIOLENT EXPLOSION LEAVING AN UP TURNED CRATER IN THE  GLASS ROOF.    THE CAR IS CURRENTLY AT THE DEALER AND THEY DENY ANY KNOWLEDGE OF PROBLEMS WITH ANY SUNROOFS DISPUTE THE RECALL ON SIMILAR ROOFS ON OTHER KIA AND HYUNDAI MODELS.  *TR
DRIVING ON A CITY ROAD DURING NORMAL TRAFFIC (4:30PM EST) MY VEHICLE BEGAN TO MAKE LARGE RATTLING NOISE FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT I HAD PICKED UP SOMTHING ON THE ROAD, BUT AS I ACCELERATED/DECCELERATED THE NOISE BECAME LOUDER/SOFTER.  I IMMEDIATLEY CONTACTED MY KIA DEALERSHIP.  AFTER SPEAKING TO THE SERVICE MANAGER HE TOLD ME TO BRING THE VEHICLE IN NEXT WEEK SINCE THAT WOULD BE THE SOONEST IT COULD BE LOOKED AT.  I INFORMED HIM THAT I DID'NT THINK I COULD EVEN MAKE IT HOME LET ALONE WAIT A WEEK TO BRING THE VEHICLE IN.  HE STATED I COULD DROP IT OFF, BUT IT WOULD NOT BE LOOKED AT UNTIL NEXT WEEK.  EITHER WAY, WITHIN 10 MIUTES OF DRIVING A LARGE BANGING NOISE WENT OFF UNDER THE HOOD, ENGINE OIL SPRAYED THROUGHT THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND I HAD COMPLETE LOSS OF POWER.  KIA ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE TOWED THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE THEY HAVE INFORMED ME THAT THE ENGINE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.  THE VEHICLE IS LESS THAN 2 WEEKS OLD AND HAD 600 MILES WHEN THIS OCCURED.  I INFORMED THE DEALERSHIP I WOULD NOT WANT A VEHICLE WITH A REPLACED ENGINE AND THEY HAVE INFORMED ME THAT IS MY ONLY OPTION.  I WILL NOT BE PURCHASING FROM KIA AGAIN AS THERE WAS NO SUPPORT FROM THEIR CORPORATE CUSTOMER SERVICE EITHER.  *TR
I'VE OWNED THIS VEHICLE FOR ABOUT ONE WEEK. WITHIN THE FIRST TWO DAYS I NOTICED A SLIGHT DRIFTING OF THE VEHICLE WHILE DRIVING ABOVE 40 MPH, BUT DISMISSED IT AS BEING CAUSED BY THE HIGH WINDS THAT WERE OCCURRING DURING THAT TIME. OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS, THESE DRIFTING EXPERIENCES LINGERED. THE WORST EXPERIENCE OCCURRED 02/14/13, BETWEEN 5:30PM AND 6:15PM, A HIGH TRAFFIC PERIOD, ON A FREEWAY WHICH IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION. AFTER MAKING A LEFT TURN FROM A TRAFFIC LIGHT ONTO THE FREEWAY, I PROCEEDED INTO THE LEFT LANE. WITHIN A FEW FEET, OR ACCELERATION TO 50 MPH OR SO, THE FRONT WHEELS, BEGAN TO PULL TOWARD THE RIGHT. BOTH OF MY HANDS WERE ON THE STEERING WHEEL THE ENTIRE TIME, BUT I HAD TO STEER SLIGHTLY LEFT TO CORRECT TO AVOID GOING INTO THE RIGHT LANE. A FEW SECONDS LATER, THE SAME SCENARIO OCCURRED AS ABOVE. I NEXT CHANGED TO THE RIGHT LANE AS MY EXIT WAS NEARING. WITHIN 3/4 MILE THERE IS A SLIGHT CURVE LEFT, WHICH THE CAR HAD ISSUES CORNERING  AND AGAIN LED TO MY HAVING TO STEER TO CORRECT. THIS IS SAFETY CONCERN, A SERIOUS ONE.   THIS IS NOT A RANDOM, EVERY SO OFTEN OCCURRENCE. IT IS DAILY, FREQUENT, IF I TRAVEL ON A FREEWAY OR ANYTIME SPEED LIMITS ARE ABOVE 35 MPH.  THERE ARE OTHER INSTANCES OF WHAT APPEAR TO BE CORNERING ISSUES. LEFT TURNS ARE AWKWARD IF YOU FOLLOW PROPER PROCEDURE FOR TURNING INTO THE LANE CLOSEST TO YOU. MOST TURNS END UP WIDE, AS IF YOU'RE DRIVING A WIDER CHASSIS VEHICLE, I.E. A PICK-UP OR SUV.  THE STEERING DEFECT EVEN APPEARS NOTICEABLE UPON PARKING, AS THE STEERING WHEEL IS ALWAYS A HAIR OFF CENTER WHEN YOU PARK STRAIGHT IN A STALL OR SPACE.  IN THE CITY I RESIDE IN THE STATE OF NEVADA, CONSTANT ROAD CONSTRUCTION, LANES THAT CHANGE FROM HORIZONTAL TO ZIG-ZAG EVERY FEW FEET, THE LAST THING NEEDED IS A CAR THAT HAS ANY HINT OF A FAULT WITH STEERING OR SUSPENSION. *TR
On 3 July 2025, while driving the car suddenly lost power and started smoking under the hood. I pulled over, exited the vehicle, and an engine fire started a minute later. The fire department put out the fire. The safety of myself and my child were at risk. We were driving at 40 miles per hour when the car lost power and caught fire. There were no warning lights. The car was towed to an independent repair shop to be evaluated, but results have not yet been gathered. There are known issues and recalls associated with 2014 Kia optima and with its engine losing power and catching fire, but my VIN was not included in the recalls when it should have been. This could have resulted in injury or the loss of life. At a minimum it has caused a loss of financial stability for my family due to Kia failing to produce and maintain safe vehicles.
The paint is peeling horribly
There is a serious malfunction with the motor driven power steering. Needs replacement as I am not able to steer my car thus I am not able to drive it.
My Kia motor  was ordered Kia gave me a hard time to rent me a car. I went  2 months with NO Transportation.   Finally I got my car back and every 3 weeks different  lights are coming on. Seat belt is now own O2 sensors had to be changed  Now  Cadillac Converter Light is on.  I didn't know that getting a new motor I would have to keep spending money that I don't have.  Kia should be responsible for  this  it shouldn't be my fault that I'm being punished for a Bad MOTOR.
The contact owns a 2014 Kia Optima. The contact stated while driving at an undisclosed speed, the vehicle inadvertently lost motive power. The contact was able to coast to the shoulder of the roadway, where the vehicle failed to restart. No warning lights were illuminated. The vehicle was towed to the dealer, who diagnosed a general failure with the engine. The vehicle was not repaired. After investigating the failure, the contact related the failure to NHTSA Campaign Number: 17V224000 (Engine and Engine Cooling) however, the VIN was not included. The manufacturer was notified of the failure but provided no assistance. The failure mileage was 75,000.
The pain is delaminating (peeling) throughout the vehicle. The pain color is white pearl, it starts bubbling up then peeling off in large areas.
The Pearl White paint has begun to peel and flake off. This vehicle has been well cared for and has 96k miles. It appears a defect in the paint has resulted in a lot of paint issues for Kia and Hyundai vehicles.   This needs to be investigated and a resolution is warranted.
I was making a right hand turn and I noticed my turn signal was flashing very fast. So I pulled over once I had the opportunity to. I turned on my signal and checked to see if they were working and found my rear to be out. Went to the parts store purchased new bulbs and drove home. My husband changed the bulbs on both sides and it still did the same thing I checked the bulbs and they were the correct ones so we swapped it and still not working. Has a electrical issue in the tail light assembly.
As I was driving my 2014 Kia Optima the engine light turned on and started flashing. Within seconds of that the oil light and battery light turned on and my car started slowing down and thankfully I was able to put pull over. As soon as I pulled over my car turned off and I was unable to turn it back on. I have keep my vehicle up to date with all the recalls and maintenance. My vehicle was inspected by a local mechanic and stated that the engine was seized and engine needed replacement. My vehicle hasn’t reached the 100,000 miles yet.
On November 11 2021 i was on the highway doing 65 mph. I heard a putting sound then, no pressure on gas paddle. After cruising about a half mile up the highway the i was finally able to pull to the shoulder.   After about a week i took the car to Capital KIA in Columbus, Ohio. They looked at my car said my engine was most likely down due to the recall. We walk to the tech computer. I give him my vin number, and he see i have a salvage title and refuse to do the recall.  I got the car towed there and back.
My car has 80,000 miles and the paint chipping on the bumper, hood, and roof is starting to cause rust on the car body.
Attempted theft of vehicle on 04/09/21 by breaking in the rear window since it is not armed by the factory alarm.  Then breaking the steering column and using a USB charging cable to start vehicle.  Vehicle is still with the dealer Russ Darrow Kia, Wauwatosa, WI. awaiting parts (back logged) due to the epidemic of break-ins on Kia and Hyundai models. Police report # 21-099-0033 and Insurance claims adjuster have been notified and paid for repairs - $3,000; claim # A00003252795 Vehicle is available for view upon request.  Kia or Hyundai has does nothing to mitigate the problem nor have they acknowledged the problem. I have made several attempts to reach out to Kia for assistance, but to no avail.
A LOCAL SHOP DIAGNOSED THE CAR AND SAID THE ENGINE SEIZED.  BEFORE I BROUGHT IT TO THE SHOP A LOCAL MECHANIC SAID THAT THE BEARING(S)/ NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AND SAID THAT THE ENGING IS VERY CLOSE TO SEIZING.  I CALL MY LOCAL KIA DEALERSHIP AND ASKED ABOUT IT, THEY SAID THAT THERE IS ONLY 1 RECALL SHOWING ON THE KIA WEBSITE.  I HAVE SCREENSHOTS OF 4 DIFFERENT RECALLS AND 1 OF THEM SAYS BEARING DEFFECT CAN CAUSE THE ENGINE TO SEIZE. SO IDK IF THEY ARE TRYING TO NOT ENTERTAIN MY RECALL BUT THEY ALSO SAID THAT I WOULD HAVE TO TOWE IT THERE AND THEY WILL DO TAKE CARE OF THE RECALL THAT IS SHOWING UP ON THEIR END WHICH IS NOT THE REASON WHY THE CAR IS DOWN.  LUCKILY THE CAR DIED WHEN I STOPPED AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT AND I WAS JUST STUCK ON THE ROAD.
I EXPERIENCE A BMS WARNING LIGHT ON MY HYBRID VEHICLE INDICATING TO STOP THE VEHICLE AND DO NOT DRIVE.  THIS HAPPEN ON THE FAST LANE OF THE 14 FREEWAY IN ACTON CA.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE LOCAL KIA  I WAS TOLD IT WAS THE HYBRID COOLANT A COMPUTER PROGRAM AND A HYBRID DRIVE BELT REPLACED THE COMPUTER PROGRAM.   THE UPDATE OF THE PROGRAM I WOULD OF NOT KNOW ABOUT THE ISSUE SINCE ONLY DEALERS ARE AWARE OF IT.  I PAID OVER 700.00 WHEN I PICKED UP MY CAR FOR THE REPAIRS. DROVE IT THE NEXT DAY I EXPERIENCE LOSS OF POWER AGAIN WHEN I WAS TRYING TO CROSS AN INTERSECTION IN THE CITY OF ACTON. MY CAR ALMOST STOP AND THE HEV WARNING LIGHT CAME ON.  CALLED THE DEALER AGAIN AND WAS TOLD TO BRING IT RIGHT AWAY.  THE SERVICE ADVISOR CALLED ME AFTER A WEEK AND HALF LATER AND TOLD ME THE PROBLEM WAS THE POWER RELAY ASSEMBLY AND THE HYBRID BATTERY THAT HAD TO BE REPLACED.  PER REPAIR ADVISER,  THIS ISSUE IS A COMMON BUT FOR HIM TO DO THE REPAIRS  I WOULD NEED TO PAY 5800.00.  HE DID ADVISE TO CALL KIA CORPORATION FOR POSSIBLE ASSISTANCE BUT THEY WERE NO HELP. SINCE I CAN NOT AFFORD THE 5800. I PICKED UP MY CAR AGAIN FROM THE DEALERSHIP AND PAID AN ADDITIONAL 318.00 FOR DIAGNOSE SERVICES.  THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH KIA SINCE THE SERVICE ADVISER TOLD ME HE ONLY HAD A BULLETIN MEMO OF POSSIBLE ISSUES WITH LOSS OF POWER. I ASKED IF THIS WARRANT A RECALL BUT THE ANSWER WAS NO SINCE IT'S ONLY A MEMO AND THE BATTERIES ARE BUILT TO LAST ONLY 150,000 MILES I WAS LUCKY IT LASTED AND ADDITIONAL 18000. MILES.  I JUST BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE 3 YEARS AGO AND NOW I'M SITTING ON A GIANT PAPER WEIGHT SINCE I CAN NOT DRIVE MY CAR TO AVOID FURTHER DAMAGE OR POSSIBLY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.

THE CONTACT STATED SHORTLY AFTER THE RESTART THE VEHICLE STALLED AGAIN. HE THEN PARKED IN A PARKING LOT, OPENED THE HOOD, HEARD A SCREW FALL AND SAW FLAMES COMING FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE ENGINE. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED AND EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE. THERE WAS A POLICE REPORT FILED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED AWAY TO A SALVAGE LOT. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT TOTALED DUE TO THE CONTACT SWITCHING INSURANCE COVERAGE TO ANOTHER USED VEHICLE.

I WAS DRIVING HOME WITH MY CHILD IN THE CAR APPROXIMATELY AT 67 MPH ON FREEWAY 99 NORTH FROM LA TO BAKERSFIELD CA AND ALL OF A SUDDEN CAR STALLED. I WAS ON THE FAST LANE AND REACTED IMMEDIATELY TURNED MY EMERGENCY LIGHTS ON BUT CARS BEHIND ME WERE SO SHORT INTO REAR ENDING ME I CRIED BECAUSE I WAS JUST SHOCKED AND SCARED FOR MY SON. LUCKILY MY AUNT WAS TWO CARS BEHIND ME SINCE WE HAD TOOK A SHORT FAMILY TRIP AND THEY HELPED ME OUT. I HAD JUST TOOK MY CAR FOR AN OIL CHANGE TO KIA HADDAD OF BAKERSFIELD WHERE THEY ALSO FIXED A RECALL ON MY VEHICLE. THIS IS THE THIRD TIME ENGINE FAILURE HAPPENS TO THIS CAR. THE FIRST TIME WAS IN JUNE OF 2017 THAT'S WHAT KIA TOLD ME THAT'S WHY THEY COULDN'T REPLACE THE  BECAUSE THEY HAD ALREADY REPLACED IT AND WAS OUT OF WARRANTY  THE SECOND WHEN IT HAPPENED TO ME IN 2018. SAME THING HAPPENED CAR STALLED WITH MY SON WITH ME. MECHANIC SAID I NEEDED A ENGINE WHICH HE ENDED UP REPLACING I PAYED FOR THAT. NOW THIS HAPPENS AGAIN FOR THE THIRD TIME ? I'M JUST SO OVERWHELMED I'VE BEEN SO LUCKY I HAVEN'T CAUSED NO ACCIDENT. NOW I'M SCARED TO EVEN FIX THIS CAR AGAIN AND DRIVE IT.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 KIA OPTIMA. WHILE DRIVING 60 MPH, THE VEHICLE STALLED WITHOUT WARNING. THE CONTACT MENTIONED THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED MULTIPLE TIMES. THE VEHICLE COASTED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. ON ONE OCCASION, WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS DEPRESSED, THE VEHICLE FAILED TO COME TO A COMPLETE STOP. AS A RESULT, THE VEHICLE CRASHED INTO A GUARDRAIL. THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED. THE CONTACT SUSTAINED INJURIES TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER THAT REQUIRED MEDICAL ATTENTION. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO A LOCAL TOW LOT AND THEN TOWED TO KIA ATLANTA SOUTH (7310 JONESBORO RD, MORROW, GA 30260, (770) 968-3400); HOWEVER, THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED.

AFTER BEGINNING TO ACCELERATE TO MAKE A LEFT TURN THROUGH AN INTERSECTION, THE ACCELERATION CUT OUT AND THE ENGINE BEGAN MAKING A GRINDING/ CRANKING NOISE.  I ROLLED TO A STOP JUST PAST THE INTERSECTION (LUCKILY NO ONE HIT ME) AND HAD TO TURN THE CAR COMPLETELY OFF.  IT RESET AND EVERYTHING BEGAN WORKING AGAIN AFTER RESTARTING IT.
WHILE DRIVING THE KIA ON THE HIGHWAY AFTER GETTING REPAIRED FOR CRACKING THE TRANSMISSION DUE TO RUNNING OVER A MEDIAN THE CAR ENGINE SEIZED WHILE IN FULL MOTION ON THE HIGHWAY.  GOING 65MPH ENGINE STOPPED AND CAR CAME TO A STOP AFTER DRIVING 5 MILES  FROM THE SHOP. I CALLED THE ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE TO COME TOW THE CAR. THEY TOOK IT TO THE NEAREST KIA DEALERSHIP WHICH I HAD CALLED AND EXPLAINED I WAS ABOUT TO TAKE THE CAR INTO BE CHECKED OUT FOR THE RECALL NOTICE I HAD RECEIVED. THE SHOP HAD TOLD ME IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE TIMING CHAIN BUT WHEN I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH THE MAN IN THE KIA DEALERSHIP HE STATED THAT A PIECE OF CAME OFF IN THE OIL PAN AND WENT INTO THE ENGINE. WHEN I ASKED HIM IF THIS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE RECALL HE STATED NO. I DON'T KNOW I THINK IT HAD TO HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE RECALL HOW ELSE WOULD THERE BE ANYTHING IN THE OIL PAN OR COME LOOSE IN THE ENGINE LIKE THAT. MY CAR HAS BEEN TOTALED OUT I NO LONGER HAVE A VEHICLE TO DRIVE. THERE'S NO WAY THAT RUNNING OVER A CURB COULD MAKE THE ENGINE COMPLETELY SEIZED UP. PLUS I HAD DRIVEN THE CAR A WEEK BEFORE, IT HAD DROVE JUST FINE, A LITTLE ROUGH HOWEVER WAS STILL LEAKING TRANSMISSION FLUID FOR THE NEW TRANSMISSION SO I SENT IT BACK TO THE SHOP. NOW THE SECOND TIME I GET IT FROM THE SHOP THAT'S WHEN IT BREAKS DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD DO TO A SEIZING ENGINE. SURE MAKES ME QUESTION IT
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 KIA OPTIMA. WHILE DRIVING HIGH SPEEDS, THE SUN ROOF SHATTERED. THERE WERE NO INJURIES.

TOOK MY VEHICLE IN FOR A ENGINE RECALL. IT ONLY TOOK 10 MINUTES. NO EXPLANATION ON WHAT WAS THE PROCESS TO CHECK A RECALLED ENGINE. NO DETAILS ON HOW AND WHAT WAS DONE TO CHECK THE ENGINE. THIS AN INDICATION THAT KIA IS TRYING TO SAVE MONEY. ALSO NHTSA SHOULD INDICATE ON IT'S WEBSITE BEFORE THE REMEDY, INDICATE THE PROCESS BEING USED TO CHECK THE ENGINE. ALL THEY STATED WAS PASS.
I WAS DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE THIS PAST WEEKEND WHEN I HEARD THIS KNOCKING SOUND AT ABOUT 70 PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR AND THE NOISE BECAME LOUDER.  I THEN CALLED ROAD SIDE ASSISTANT AND ATTEMPTED TO MAKE TO THE CLOSET GAS STATION WHEN THE CAR JERKED HEARD A LOUD NOISE AND THE CAR SHUT COMPLETELY OFF AND WOULD NOT START, I WAS ABLE TO COAST TO THE SHOULDER.  LONG STORY SHORT CAR HAS  BEEN SERVICED BY KIA SINCE I PURCHASED IT IN NOVEMBER 2015 WITH 16,725 MILES USED , IT CURRENTLY HAS LESS THAN 41,000 MILES (NOT KNOWING THAT THE POWER TRAIN WARRANTY IS ONLY 5 YEARS 60000 MILES IF YOU AREN'T THE ORIGINAL OWNER UNTIL THE CLAIM WAS FILED).  WHEN THE KIA SERVICE MANAGER CALLED ME HE SAID THE ENGINE HAD SEIZED UP AND THE ENGINE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  HOWEVER HE HAS TO WAIT ON AUTHORIZATION.    I WAS 166 MILES AWAY FROM HOME THEY COULD NOT PROVIDE A RENTAL I HAD TO PAY OUT OF POCKET BUT WILL BE REIMBURSED.  IT WILL TAKE A WEEK TO REPLACE WHICH MEANS PAYING FOR A RENTAL AND I HAVE TO GO PICK UP MY CAR ONCE IT IS REPAIRED SO I WILL BE TAKING OFF WORK. A DEFECTIVE MOTOR ALTHOUGH ITS COVERED BY THE WARRANTY IS COSTING ME.  I WAS ENSURED THAT THE NEW MOTORS HAVE BEEN CHANGED SO THAT I WILL NOT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM 40,000 MILES LATER.  I WONDER IF THE WARRANTY IS GOING TO BE EXTENDED WITH THE NEW MOTOR.  A RECALL NEED TO BE ISSUED.  THE CONNECTING ROD IN THE ENGINE BECOMES TOO HOT  EITHER IT SIEZES OR BREAKS.  MY OPTIMA IS A TURBO I AM NOT SURE ABOUT THE OTHERS.
I PURCHASED A KIA OPTIMA IN DECEMBER OF 2014. AT 8,000 MILES I NOTICED UNUSUAL WEAR ON MY TIRES, I HAD THEM ROTATED AND BALANCED AT 7,500. I RECENTLY WENT TO AMERICA TIRES WITH THE MILEAGE AT 14,50 THEY CONFIRMED THAT THE TIRES WERE WORN DOWN TO LESS THAN 50% OF THE TREAD. THEY ROTATED AND BALANCED THEM BUT THE LIFE OF MY TIRES IS SHORT. IT APPEARS THAT THE TIRES ARE INFERIOR.     I FEEL UNSAFE DRIVING MY CAR. I HAVE DRIVEN SEVERAL CARS HOWEVER I HAVE NEVER HAD TO REPLACED TIRES THIS SOON ON A VEHICLE. I HAVE ABOUT 5 TO 7 THOUSANDS MILES LEFT BEFORE REPLACEMENT IS NEEDED. THE TIRES IN QUESTION ARE NPRIZAH8. MY FEAR IS THAT SEVERAL UNSUSPECTING PEOPLE ARE DRIVING AROUND ON THESE UNSAFE TIRES WHICH COULD CAUSE SERIOUS PROBLEMS. ESPECIALLY THOSE  WHO DON'T HAVE REGULAR SERVICE ON THEIR TIRES.   CAN YOU TELL ME IF THERE HAS THERE BEEN ANY ISSUES WITH THESE TIRES?
AS WE WERE PULLING INTO A PARKING LOT, THE PANORAMIC SUNROOF EXPLODED OUTWARDS.  THE SUNROOF IS BOWED UPWARDS AND GLASS FRAGMENTS WERE ON THE TOP AND TRUNK DECK OF THE CAR.  NOTHING STRUCK THE CAR, THE SUNROOF LITERALLY EXPLODED OUTWARDS.      AFTER DOING A GOOGLE SEARCH, I FOUND HUNDREDS OF ENTRIES FOR EXPLODING SUNROOFS IN BOTH THE OPTIMA AND THE KIA SORENTO.  *TR
WHEN BUYING THE CAR I NEVER TESTED IT ON A HIGHWAY OR ABOVE 45MPH.  AFTER BUYING I TOOK IT ON THE HIGHWAY AND HAD TO USE EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY TO KEEP THE CAR ON A STRAIGHT LINE.  IT WAS FIRGHTENING.  WILL NOT EVEN LET MY WIFE DRIVE OT ON THE HIGHWAY.  THE STEERING HAS A MIND OF ITS OWN.  TOOK IT BACK TO DEALER AND THEY STATED IT WAS FINE AND PART OF THE NEW STEERING CONTROL SYSYTEM KIA DEVELOPED.  EVEN TRIED NEW TIRES BUT THE CAR IS STILL ALL OVER THE ROAD.  THEY ALSO CHANGED VIA SOFTWARE UPDATE THE STEERING TO "SPORT MODE" TO TOGHTEN UP THE STEERING.  WHILE IT DID FEEL BETTER THE STEERING IS STILL FRIGHTENING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS - ESPECIALLY IF THERE ARE WING GUSTS.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SERIOUS ISSUE.
Well my paint is peeling everywhere I only had car 4 years, I can barely wash it because the car wash takes more paint off, I seen Hyundai do a paint recall or something like that so I'm wondering if it's the same for Kia.
Car was purchased April 2025, I’ve had it less then 2 months and check engine light came on and then flashing. I had it scanned at Auto Zone and was told the code is VVT Solenoid. I had it replaced 6/12/25. I was told by the mechanic that it didn’t solve the issue and metal shavings were on the old one. The car is still constantly going in to limp mode and there’s a knocking noise now. The Auto zone scan listed the mileage as 150,000 yet the car dealership listed and sold it as 101,000. I have a 2015 Kia Optima Ex. The title does not list it as a rebuilt and appeared to be fairly clean and maintained . The mechanic told me the engine needs replaced.
The engine shut off while on the highway, car was still moving but not power from engine when accelerating the gas, not leaks or lack of maintenance
I was driving to a new job , it was about 5:45am when I noticed my car wouldn’t go faster or stop. I seen fire , tried to stop car, I was going about 15-20 mph when i decided to just get out of the car and run , care went into complete flames

Hi I have a 2015 Kia optima white(pearl). Like many other white Kia’s on the road, my paint is continuously simply flaking off. This problem is being ignored by Kia which is very frustrating. How is it that Kia is able to avoid this problem when several Kia’s are having the same problem but because our cars are “ out of warranty” for the useless first 3 years paint warranty they claim to have it’s ok. It’s outrageous a 2015 shouldn’t be having paint problems that insane to even think about.
Engine started knocking
The car started making a noise and oil was just changed the prior month no leaks or anything and know it makes a noise and the engine light is on

Pearl white paint is peeling and chipping.  I have photos, paint Samples and Receipts from having to repair to prevent rust.
White pearl color start pealing off, affected area is at the back of the roof above the back window.
The paint on my pearl white 2015 Kia started chipping around windshield areas a few years ago. Front ,side and back.  Now the whole trunk is coming off and an area around rear passenger side.  It just keeps spreading and I am so embarrassed and frustrated.  My car is in great condition.  no dents , no accidents! I take good care of it and this is what it looks like?  Not right and Kia needs to do something about it.
There is an open recall on the engine of my vehicle 2015 Kia Optima.  The engine is giving problems and has been at the local dealership since December 1st, 2022. They stated they will not fix it because the vehicle has a salvage title.  According to the information we have obtained this doesn't null the recall repairs on the vehicle.  Please advise.
Anti Theft Security system is non-existent. There is a current known issue on the internet on the ease of theft of any Kia or Hyundai to certain years of manufacture. I am currently a single disabled person that could be a victim of vehicle theft because of a lack of this security software that Kia did not include on my 2015 vehicle. This Kia/Hyundai known issue could potentially leave anyone stranded in a dangerous situation. All other prior and current vehicles are equipped with the security software. Currently Kia & Hyundai has provided Lock bars for certain police departments to hand out, however .. not in my area. I am receiving warning letters from my Insurance company and have heard of some totally dropping coverages on all vehicles manufactured without the security software. This is a very dangerous situation and I believe that ALL VEHICLES AFFECTED SHOULD BE ISSUED AN IMMEDIATE RECALL AND SOFTWARE UPDATE PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURERS AT NO COST TO CURRENT OWNERS OF THESE DEFECTIVE VEHICLES. A proposed class action lawsuit was started in September 2022. In the meantime.. what happens to innocent people who go to a grocery store or doctors office only to find that their car had been stolen while they were inside? Or what happens when they can no longer receive insurance coverage because of the ease of this known lack of security originally promised from the manufacturer? These particular Kia/Hyundai's are missing a "key" anti-theft device..their keys lack computer chips for theft "immobilizer" systems that other car manufacturers have as a standard theft deterrant during those same years of manufacture & currently have on all new vehicles. A MANDATORY RECALL FOR REPAIR SHOULD BE ISSUED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE ALL INSURANCE COMPANIES REFUSE TO INSURE THESE VEHICLES! Anti-Theft technology was included on the sticker price but not installed! I am afraid to go to the grocery store!!

I have my driver side tail light out, when I bought the car in 2019, they said I have 30 days to bring in my car so they can replace what needs fixing, well I hit day 32 and I’ve had to replace my tires, brakes, headlights and tail lights because they all went out on my own dime,  now my brakes are making me nervous because sometimes it feels like my car isn’t slowing down to a stop and I have to slam them to stop sometimes.

THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY WOULD DO THAT WHILE PERFORMING THE OTHER SERVICE WORK. 3 WEEKS AFTER THE OIL CHANGE I WAS DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE THE CAR SUDDDENLY LOST POWER AFTER A BIG PUFF OF WHITE SMOKE AND LOUD NOISE. I WORKED MY WAY OVER TO THE NEST EXIT AND PROCEEDED TO TURN AROUND TO GO BACK HOME. NO WARNING/ENGINE/OIL  LIGHTS CAME ON DURING THIS TIME. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND NEVER RETURNED MY CALL, WITH NO RESULTS. WE CHECKED THE OIL THE CAR WAS 3 QUARTS LOW. CONTINUE TO NOTIFY THE DEALER TO NO AVAIL. THE CAR NEEDED 3 QUARTS OF OIL EVERYTIME I CHECKED IT WEEKLY. LET ME REINTERATE THAT THE CAR WAS RUNNING FINE BEFORE I TOOK IT IN FOR SERVICE IN NOV 2018. I CALLED KIA CORP. THEY INFOMED ME THAT MY CAR WAS NOT UNDER RECALL AND THAT THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO BECASUE I HAD 68K ON THE CAR. THEY ASKED ME TO HAVE IT TOWED IN FOR DIAGNOSTIC TEST. NOW THEY WANT ME TO PROVIDE ALL THE SERVICE RECORDS. THE SERVICE RECORDS WAS IN THE KIA DEALERSHIP SYSTEM AS I HAVE USED THAT DEALER (PRIOR OWNER) FOR MOST OF MY WORK. I AM NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SERVICE RECORDS. AT THIS POINT THEY REFUSE TO REPLACE THE ENGINE. KIA HAS RECALLED EVERY YEAR BUT 2015 - APPARENTLY THEY THINK THEY GOT IT RIGHT IN 2015 SINCE THE MOTOR WAS BUILT IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION. THE ENGINE I S PRACICALLY GONE AND I HAVE HAD THE CAR LESS THAN 4 YEARS. I PURCHASED BAND NEW OFF THE LOT 9/2015. I FEEL LIKE THEY SHOULD BE MADE TO ADD THE 2015 KIA OPTIMA TO THE ENGINE RECALL LIST BEFORE SOMEONE GET SERIOUSLY HURT EITHER BY THE CAR STOPPING IN HIGHWAY TRAFFIC OR CATCHING ON FIRE. DOOR HANDLE ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE CONTIUES TO STICK AND THE DORR WILL NOT OPEN FROM OUTSIDE OR INSIDE.
AROUND 55,000 MILES I STARTED HAVING LOW OIL AND HAVING TO ADD OIL, SHORTLY I HEARD SOME RATTLING UNDER THE HOOD. AT THIS TIME I ALSO STARTED TO NOTICE WHITE SMOKE FROM THE TAILPIPE WHEN I WOULD ACCELERATE. I TOOK IT IN TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY REFUSED TO COVER IT UNDER WARRANTY SAYING I DID NOT MAINTAIN THE PROPER OIL CHANGES. I OFFERED PROOF OF ALL MY OIL CHANGE RECEIPTS AND THEY STILL DENIED TO FIX IT. I COULD NOT AFFORD THE FIX THEY SAY NEEDED TO BE DONE SO I JUST DECIDED I WOULD JUST ADD THE EXTRA OIL TO THE ENGINE EVERY WEEK HOWEVER AROUND 63,000 THE ENGINE BLEW. NOW CURRENTLY THE CAR IS AT THE DEALERSHIP AND I AM AWAITING TO SEE WHAT THEY WILL DO ABOUT IT. I HAVE READ SO MANY COMPLAINTS ON THIS EXACT ISSUE ON THIS CAR AND I EXPECT THEM TO FIX MY CAR.
2015 OPTIMA SXL WITH 130K MILES REGULARLY MAINTAINED WITH ALL HIGHWAY MILES.  WHILE TRAVELING ON THE HIGHWAY AT 70 MPH, CAR BEGAN TO MAKE A MILD KLANKING SOUND.  SLOWED THE VEHICLE DOWN AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER, A LOUD BANG OCCURRED UNDER THE HOOD AND ENGINE LOST ALL POWER.  PULLED OFF THE ON THE SHOULDER AND ENGINE COMPARTMENT WAS ON FIRE.  THE ENGINE AND A FEW OTHER LIGHTS WERE ON.   LUCKILY, I WAS ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE WHICH CONTINUED TO BURN.  THE CAR IS A TOTAL LOSS.  NO PRIOR SOUNDS OR NOISES SUGGESTING A PROBLEM.  ALL KIA UPDATES OR MAINTENANCE NOTICES WERE HANDLED BY A KIA DEALER.  THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED NEW AND HAS BEEN WELL MAINTAINED WITH ALL OIL CHANGES AND MAINTENANCE DONE BY A SHOP.  HAVE HAD NO MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THIS VEHICLE AND THIS IS NOT ONLY A SURPRISE BUT A CONCERN AS THIS IS MY SECOND KIA (PRIOR ONE IS STILL OWNED).
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 KIA OPTIMA. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 65 MPH, THE VEHICLE STALLED WITHOUT WARNING. THE VEHICLE WAS ABLE TO COAST TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. THE VEHICLE WAS ABLE TO RESTART, BUT FAILED TO ACCELERATE. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE ENGINE FAILED. THE CONTACT WAS ADVISED TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO A KIA DEALER. THE VEHICLE WAS LATER TOWED TO KIA AUTO TEAM DELAWARE (1603 PENNSYLVANIA AVE, WILMINGTON, DE 19806, (877) 364-9441) WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE ENGINE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE AND A CASE WAS OPENED. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 100,000.
VEHICLE SUDDENLY STOPPED WHILE TRAVELING ON HIGHWAY FROM MISSISSIPPI TO PENNSYLVANIA, WHEN VEHICLE STOPPED THERE WAS NOT ANY OIL IN THE CAR. MY SON HAD IT TOWED TO NEAREST WALMART, PURCHASED 3 QUARTS, AND CONTINUED. FOUR HOURS DOWN THE ROAD VEHICLE STOPPED WHILE I WAS DRIVING.HEI WAS CLOSE TO BIRMINGHAM AROUND 11 AT NIGHT. HE STAYED ON THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY UNTIL MORNING CALLED A TOW TRUCK AND TOOK TO RIVERSIDE KIA WHERE AN ENGINE ANALYSIS WAS DONE. HE TOLD MY SON THE IS OWNER NEGLIGIENCE. HE TOLD HIM ACCORDING THE MILES ON THE VEHICLE HE SHOULD HAVE HAD AT LEAST 9 OIL CHANGES, BUT THERE WHERE ONLY 3 RECEIPTS IN THE CAR. PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENCE HIS VEHICLE HAD BEEN BROKEN INTO. HE WAS ABLE TO LOCATE OTHER RECEIPTS. HE HAD THE OIL CHANGED 3 WEEKS BEFORE THIS (OCT 29, 2016)
THE OPTIMA HAS STALLED MULTIPLE TIMES WHILE DRIVING ON BOTH THE HIGHWAY AND CITY STREETS. WHEN THE CAR STALLS EVERYTHING SHUTS OFF COMPLETELY AND IT'S IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO STEER. MY 2 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER HAS BEEN IN THE CAR DURING RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC A COUPLE TIMES WHILE THIS HAS HAPPENED. I HAVE CALLED BOTH KIA CORPORATE AND THE KIA DEALERSHIP WHERE THE WAS PURCHASED AND THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY THE CAR IS STALLING. AFTER 3-5 WEEKS OF GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH THE KIA CORPORATE AND THE DEALERSHIP THEY HAVE FINALLY TOLD ME THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.
2015 KIA OPTIMA WAS OUT OF OIL @ 22,000 MILES AND NO INDICATOR LIGHT HAD GONE ON WHEN IT WAS TAKEN TO AN OIL CHANGE.  THE OIL CHANGE PLACE WAS THE ONE THAT INDICATED THAT THE VEHICLE HAD NO OIL IN IT.   IT STARTED MAKING SOME RATTLING NOISE SPECIALLY GOINT UPHILL SO I TOOK IT IN TO KIA SERVICE DEPARTMENT.  THEY DIAGNOSED IT WITH "SLUDGE" IN THE ENGINE AND ENGINE WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED.   I HAD TO PROVE 3 PREVIOUS RECEIPTS OF OIL CHANGES OTHERWISE THE WARRANTY WOULD NOT COVER IT.   I DO NOT HAVE THOSE RECEIPTS AND 16 DAYS LATER TOOK IT TO THE SAME PLACE I DID MOST RECENT OIL CHANGE BECAUSE OIL LIGHT HAD TURNED ON.  THE VEHICLE AGAIN HAD NO OIL IN IT.  THE TOPPED IT OFF BUT MENTIONED THAT IT WAS NOT NORMAL FOR SUCH A RECENT MODEL TO BE BURNING OIL.  VEHICLE IS STILL RUNNING BUT MAKES RATTLING NOISE ONCE IN A WHILE,  PRODUCES WHITE SMOKE OUT OF EXHAUST PIPE AND I HAVE TO PUT OIL IN IT EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS.  I CANNOT AFFORD TO BUY A NEW ENGINE.  I AM A SINGLE MOM AND NEEDS A RELIABLE VEHICLE TO GET TO WORK.
RECURRING, INTERMITTENT LACK OF ENGINE RESPONSE TO PRESSING THE ACCELERATOR;  PARTICULARLY NOTICEABLE WHEN ATTEMPTING TO TURN LEFT AT A BREAK IN ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  ENGINE ACTS AS IF STALLING, THEN RECOVERS AFTER A SECOND OR TWO DELAY.  KIA DEALER SERVICE ADVISES THAT THIS IS A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE VEHICLE AND NOT ADJUSTMENT IS POSSIBLE TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  VEHICLE MAY BE STATIONARY OR MOVING A LESS THAN 5 MPH WHEN THIS OCCURS.  PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT AND NOT APPARENTLY RELATED TO FUEL OR CLIMATIC CONDITIONS.  RESULTS IN DRIVER UNCERTAINTY IN ANY GIVEN TURNING SITUATION WHETHER THERE IS SUFFICIENT TIME TO MAKE THE TURN;  SEVERAL NEAR CRASH EPISODES HAVE OCCURRED WHERE LACK OF  ENGINE RESPONSE TO POWER DEMAND CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO SLOW RATHER THEN ACCELERATE.  CONDITION OCCURS MOST FREQUENTLY DURING CITY DRIVING, BUT MAY ALSO OCCUR AT HIGHWAY TURNING SITUATIONS WHERE THE VEHICLE HAS STOPPED BEFORE ATTEMPTING A TURN.
AS THE FIRST OWNER OF THE CAR, I HAVE EXPERIENCED STEERING ISSUES THAT COULD BE DESCRIBED AS FEELING AS IF THE STEERING DOES NOT PROPERLY CENTER.  I CONSTANTLY HAVE TO MAKE STEERING ADJUSTMENTS TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT TO KEEP THE CAR GOING STRAIGHT DOWN THE ROAD.  THE ISSUE BECOMES MORE PRONOUNCED AS THE VEHICLE SPEED INCREASES.  THIS RESULTS IN A FEELING OF LACK OF SAFETY AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, ESPECIALLY IN MODERATE - HIGH TRAFFIC SITUATIONS OR ON NARROW ROADS.      I INFORMED THE MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT AT THE DEALERSHIP FROM WHICH I PURCHASED THE CAR ABOUT THIS ISSUE.  A MAINTENANCE TECHNICIAN TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A DRIVE AND AGREED THAT THE CAR HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING.  THE DEALERSHIP THEN CONTACTED THE KIA CONSUMER ASSISTANCE CENTER WHO EVENTUALLY DECIDED THAT THE CAR WAS OPERATING NORMALLY. KIA CONSUMER ASSISTANCE CENTER THEN CONTACTED ME TO INFORM ME OF THIS.  I CHOSE NOT TO ACCEPT THAT THIS SHOULD BE "NORMAL" AND ESCALATED THE ISSUE. KIA MOTORS AMERICA THEN CONTACTED ME DIRECTLY TO OFFER TO HAVE A DISTRICT MANAGER DRIVE THE CAR TO OBSERVE THE STEERING ISSUE.  *TR
Several safety-critical systems failed on this vehicle. The engine (Theta II 2.4L GDI) failed due to rod bearing wear, causing sudden power loss on the highway. The vehicle entered limp mode, once at 50 mph in 2018 and again at 70 mph in 2025, and had to be pulled over quickly to avoid collision.  Additional issues: all four windows failed at different times, leaving them stuck open and creating safety risks in weather or emergencies. The trunk latch failed, causing unsecured cargo risk. ABS, TPMS, and traction control warning lights illuminated repeatedly, indicating possible loss of critical safety systems. A loose wiring harness caused the turn signal bulb to burn out repeatedly, reducing visibility and signaling.  The dealership performed the KSDS software update after I reported engine trouble but did not resolve the issue. The engine soon failed completely while driving. Other issues, such as the fuse box blowing fuses from a standard USB charger have also been documented by a Kia  dealership but not always fully repaired.  The most recent engine failure and electrical defects are being inspected by a Kia dealership, and Kia Consumer Affairs is reviewing the warranty claim. Prior to the engine failure, I smelled burning oil and topped it off monthly due to excessive consumption. The oil level light and check engine light only appeared during limp mode right before the failure.  These repeated safety-critical defects, particularly sudden engine failure at highway speed, created a significant safety hazard for myself and others on the road. At the time of this report, I am in the process of seeking warranty coverage for the catastrophic engine failure through Kia. The failure behavior (limp mode, flashing check engine light, and rod knock) is consistent with the safety defect described in the Theta II engine settlement. I am concerned that despite this being a known issue, there may be delays or denials in honoring the safety-related warranty repair.
The contact owns a 2016 Kia Optima. The contact stated while driving on the highway at 65 MPH, the vehicle began to jerk excessively, and the contact was forced to pull over to the side of the road. The check engine warning light was illuminated. The vehicle was towed to a local dealer, where it was diagnosed, and the contact was informed that the fuel injectors and valve cover gasket were faulty and needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 112,260.
While driving on the highway, the roof antenna assembly flew off our car. Inspection of the area shows that the screws that were supposed to hold the antenna on had all become sheared off. It looks like there is a recall for this exact issue covering 2016 Kia Optimas produced through June 1, 2016 (SA272), but our Optima was produced on June 23, 2016 and is therefore not covered according to Kia.
All the window regulators continue to turn but the windows stay down and won't go up. Leading cause, the gear that connects to the motor and window regulator wires is plastic and erdes over time causing it to shred itself. Now my windows will not go up.
Mya paint is bubbling , chipping and peeling all over my car.
Check engine light came on and car started shaking pretty back than completely turned off.
Was on highway, engine seized,  flashing engine light and knlocking noise, car went into limp mode, took to dealership code p1326 was thrown which is engine failure, I have had the knock sensor installed thru kia prior which put me in lifetime warranty for the engine, kia dealership did a diagnostic BCT, which is a 4 to 5 hour job at the most, kia called me in less than 2 hours and told me is passed the BCT ! there is no way they did the testing in less than 2 hours, and no way it passed with engine light blinking and knocking, that's what the sensor detects is engine failure, they are refusing to honor my warranty for the new engine , picked up my car from. Dealership,  soon as I hit the end of the parking lot engine seized and loud knocking noise, was barely drivable but yet the lied on the paperwork and said it drives as designed and was fine, put in a new knock sensor which they already did a month ago! went right back in to dealership and they told me because it supposedly passed there was nothing they could do! R u kidding me!? They were rude and not wanting to help or honor my engine replacement,  so here I am with a seized engine and they tell me nothing they can do till it fails the BCT! THE DAM CAR IS IN ENGINE FAILURE! In the last 3 months I have put 3k in this car! What is it gonna take for them to honor the new engine? Gonna take me, my kids, or someone else getting hurt before they do what they said they would do? I have been in contact with corporate as well and they have yet to get a return phone call from the dealership,  they have left several messages and called bullshit as well, and believed I was treated poorly because I'm a female.....Little do they know, my father was a mechanic,  he has passed on but I grew up around cars and know what's safe and what's not and know how long it takes to do a BCU test! Basically kia told me to drive it till the engine blows completely! I just want them to honor the warranty of the engine .

I bought this car with just under 48k miles September 2023, it had a very small chip on the bumper that I assumed was from a rock. After driving this car for a while, I noticed that chip got bigger and eventually other parts of my bumper and hood started bubbling and chipping as well.90% of my bumper is now lacking paint and it’s starting to chip on my hood more. I’ve only driven it an additional 12k miles since I’ve bought it. Auto body shops are saying it’s delaminating and it’s common in this color.
The motor is knock and no acceleration . Burning oil to much. Get oil change but adding oil everyday.

Knock sensors
I was driving and the car’s electrical completely cut out and locked my steering wheel up and ran us off the road and we hit a big rock on the driver side and then the power kicked back on and the steering yanked super hard to the right about 4 times and caught a fallen tree on the right side  then completely died with me and my young kids . Took it to Kia to be serviced and got it back and it started to do it again
Pearl White paint on hood is flaking/delaminating.
Soonroof/Moonroof closed rattle noise.  When the Soonroff/Moonroof is closed at highway speeds or windy weather it make a rattle noise to inside of the car, i try to do their reset method and nothing worked, i being looking in kia forums and most of the people had complained about this issue, and that kia doesnt wants to fix. I will like an investigation of this issue and if you can start a repair campaign recall due this soonroof parts are really pricey. And i think is a manufacturer problem.

I was driving my car and it just slowed down on the freeway and wouldn’t go pass 60mph I went to my nearest autozone And received code p1326 I was told it was the knock sensor and got it changed. I checked my oil and noticed it was low even tho I got an oil change not even a month before. however the problem didn’t change. I decided to go to the internet and notice many other kia have had these problems and have received a recall

I have a kia Optima Hybrid that has an Open Recall for the engine according to Kia's website' which they failed to address or informed me of it needing it on 07-30-2022 which was installing the KSD update for the engine.   The engine started knocking on 09-12-2022. The informed me that they do not make the KSD sensor update available to customers anymore since it is passed the campaign in dates in 2021, and that is why it was not installed. Although the owners site shows the recall and asks if I want to make and appointment for it.  They are doing this with multiple owners.  I am also curious as to why my car doesn't show this recall on here and it shows on Kia's owner site as being and open recall along with another recall.  Kia case #15050283

The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 200,000. The VIN was not available.
We have had numerous problems with the engine.  There was a recall on these engines for 2011 - 2014 models.  The problems have not been corrected.  We've now been told we need a new engine.   Do we have any recourse/relief since KIA continues to sell cars with engine problems?    What can be done?

Misfire– oil on the spark plug caused misfire. check engine light came on.  OBDII scanner show a P0302 trouble code. Eventually the engine misfired enough and lead to a backfire. This also led to Decreased Fuel Mileage, Catalytic Converter Damage, and Blue Exhaust Smoke.

---  **Summary of Complaint – 2017 Kia Optima**  My 2017 Kia Optima (VIN: [XXX] ) experienced sudden engine failure due to a damaged piston. There were no warning signs—no knock codes or dashboard alerts—prior to the malfunction. Despite regular maintenance and timely oil changes, Kia denied warranty coverage, leaving me with significant repair costs.  This issue appears consistent with reported engine problems in similar Kia models and could represent a broader manufacturing defect. I'm submitting this report in hopes of prompting an investigation into a potential safety hazard. A recall may be necessary to prevent similar failures and protect  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
Unknown  Oil consumption  Spark plugs need replacement about every 500-1000 miles. Also needs oil every 500-1000
Driving highway speed (75)  after work may 23rd 2024 when my car just randomly stop accelerating and I pulled to the side of the highway and I heard a weird engine knock sound coming from engine . I turned the vehicle off and back on and it was still doing the same thing then it just cut off and wouldn’t start no more. I reached out to Kia cooperate to find out that it’s an extended life time warranty on the engine of the make of my car for rod bearings failure. I contacted Kia of Pelham Al to get an appointment to bring it in I drop it off June 9th , service app was June 10th. They failed to give a rental car … leaving me with no way to work …
I was getting on the freeway and my car suddenly just stopped accelerating. I even tried pushing the pedal to the floor and all power was gone. I was almost ran down by a 18 wheeler who must not have noticed my hazards had been switched on. A warning came on “check hybrid system. Turn off engine” When the car lost its momentum as I was pulling over and eventually came to a stop I followed the warnings directions and shut the car off since I couldn’t get any further anyways. I tried turning the car back on and then all lights and power instantly started flickering on and off and going crazy and then the warning came back on and then the whole car shut off by itself. I have been too scared to drive it since and I just got it back in October and I need a car to get to work and school and I don’t know what to do but the amount of danger this issue put me in is unsettling and cannot be overlooked.   Not sure what caused the malfunction because so many different things happened at once that it was hard to tell It is available for inspection upon request A service center confirmed that there is a problem and they believe it is related to the coolant pump and hybrid battery There was one other time that a warning came up and it just said “check hybrid battery” but it went away only like a minute later and then a couple days after that I came outside to go to work and the car was dead but then I jumped it and it was fine up until the issue I first mentioned happened where I was put in danger  A warning light that said !HEV and the check engine light both appeared
Headlights will randomly turn on and off throughout while driving. Radio has the same issue
I only had the car 2 years. In the last two years, I have been getting my oil changed every 3 months. The oil goes out fast. I'm a local driver so I don't go too many places. When I brake or stop,  my oil light blinks, when I'm completely out. This month (June 2023) it's staying on. When the temperature gage rises half way the oil light comes on and stays on. I just recently put oil in, so it's not empty or low. Nor is it overfill. I was told it's the GDI Engine. Honestly, idk where the oil is going and why it's running out so fast. And I just learned today a friend of mines KIA is starting to do the same.
I am the second owner of this car. According to carfax it has been well maintained at kia since day one. I have owned it for almost 6 months and it has been sitting at the dealership for 2months due to engine failure.  There is a rod knock and sludge build up not for lack of maintaining it but from not being driven enough. I am being told it is a $16,000 repair. These cars are warranties for 10 years 100,000 miles (it only has 72,000 miles on it) but since I'm not the original owner that warranty doesn't follow. This is a misrepresentation.
Hey, while driving my vehicle the engine light started blinking and there was a delay in my acceleration and when I got to 60-65 mph my car begins to stall and will NOT drive any faster. Also I sent my car to the dealership for repair 08/15/22 and they still haven’t diagnosed the car yet even after I received letter in mail for recall. Please help thank you
Engine is consuming excessive oil. That could cause internal parts of the engine to wear faster because of less lubrication and could lead to an engine failure while driving, which could lead to engine stopping and loss of propulsion which could cause an accident. The car went through a oil consumption test with a Kia dealership and failed by consuming more than 1 qt of oil in a 1000 miles interval. The Kia dealership proceeded to do a combustion chamber cleaning procedure and re-did oil consumption test and it failed again. They also had requested service record which where provided. Even though Kia has a service bulletin on that matter, the service advisor at the Kia dealership said that the manufacturer declined the claim. Right now I’m constantly refilling oil in the engine which is also an additional expense. The first time I noticed the issue was in February, 2022 when the low oil pressure alert came on.
While driving on an interstate on-ramp, I heard a loud bang from under my hood. I exited to the shoulder and as soon as I stopped, I heard a second, larger bang from the same area. Within a few seconds, flames started coming out of the engine compartment and began to fill the cabin of my vehicle from the area of the air vents and all through the dash. Within five minutes, the vehicle was fully engulfed in flames. I had no problems with the vehicle up to this point and the maintenance was up to date.
MY VEHICLE HAS HAD MULTIPLE ISSUES WITH ITS HYBRID BATTERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SINCE PURCHASE. IT HAS BEEN TOWED 4 TIMES. WHILE DRIVING MY CAR WILL START TO JERK AND A WARNING SYSTEM TELLING ME THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE BATTERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (BMS) AND THE POWER TRAIN. IT  WILL TELL ME TO PULL OVER OR TO CONTACT THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT. THIS CAR HAS HAD ITS BATTERY REPLACED AND SOFTWARE UPGRADED NUMEROUS TIMES, BUT I KEEP HAVING THE SAME ISSUE. I'M CONCERNED THE BATTERY SYSTEM IS FAULTY AND IT'S DANGEROUS TO DRIVE AT THIS POINT, AS NOTHING PRECEEDS THE ISSUES - THEY HAPPEN OUT OF NOWHERE.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2017 KIA OPTIMA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE CONSUMED ONE PINT OF OIL EVERY ONE THOUSAND MILES. THE CONTACT TOOK THE VEHICLE TO WALMART FOR AN OIL CHANGE AND WAS INFORMED THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE OIL ON THE DIPSTICK. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO KIA OF ANDERSON (5281 US-76, PENDLETON, SC 29670, (864) 328-0542) THREE TIMES WHERE THEY TOPPED OFF THE OIL AND ADDED MORE OIL. THE DEALER INFORMED THE CONTACT TO BRING THE VEHICLE BACK AFTER ONE THOUSAND MILES. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE DEALER AFTER THE ONE THOUSAND MILES WAS TRAVELED AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE OIL WAS LOW ONE HALF OF A QUART. THE DEALER ADVISED THE CONTACT TO REPEAT THE SAME PROCEDURE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE SAME DEALER AND THE RESULT WAS THE SAME. IN ADDITION, THE CONTACT STATED THAT AN ENGINE COMPRESSION AND OTHER UNKNOWN TESTS WERE COMPLETED AND THE INFORMATION WAS SENT TO KIA SUPPORT. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 54,000.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2017 KIA OPTIMA. WHILE ATTEMPTING TO ACCELERATE FROM A STOP, THE VEHICLE STALLED WITHOUT WARNING. AS A RESULT, ANOTHER VEHICLE CRASHED INTO THE REAR OF THE CONTACT'S VEHICLE. THERE WERE NO INJURIES AND A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED. THE CONTACT WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO JEFF WYLER KIA (LOCATED AT 5815 DIXIE HWY, FAIRFIELD, OH 45014) WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED, BUT THE TECHNICIAN COULD NOT FIND A FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER STATED THAT THEY WOULD GET BACK WITH THE CONTACT. THE CONTACT HAD NOT HEARD BACK FROM THE MANUFACTURER. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 4,700.
The contact called on behalf of his son who owned a 2018 Kia Optima. The contact stated that while driving at approximately 25 MPH, the front of the vehicle crashed into the rear end of the vehicle that was in front of him whom made a sudden stop. The contact was concerned that the air bags were not deployed. No warning lights was illuminated. A police report was filed. No medical attention was sought, and no injuries were sustained. The vehicle was pronounced totaled at the scene. The contact attempted to contact the manufacturer however, received no response. The failure mileage was 96,145.
Kia Optima headlights turn off randomly while on automatic. This dangerous issue has been investigated on other Kia models by the NTSB, which them prompted Kia to issue a recall. I have found many, many posts on car and Kia forums about headlights shutting off while driving at night with the Kia Optima (as well as other Kia items). It's very scary and very hazardous. This is a widespread issue.
It started with the car using oil but the mechanic could not determine where the oil was going. It quickly lead to the Cadillac converter going out with a host of other things that cost me over $2900 to fix. Which only lasted a few weeks and the last incident occurred when I was on my way home and it would not pick up speed at all and would stall. The first time it happened I was on the free way and it lost speed almost causing a semi to run into the back of me. The second time I was at a red light and when I tried to accelerate in speed and it stalled and then began to jerk before it would pick up speed. Each time the occurrence happened it placed my life as well as my families life in danger as it was sudden with no engine light or any other lights coming on. The last time it happened it left me stranded with a child, over 2 hours from home and in the middle of the night on isolated highway. Every time I would call KIA they would give me the run around on the issue and say it was due to my negligence but I beg to differ as I feel as if it is an engine error on the manufacturing. Please help. Currently the car is sitting in my yard and I can not afford to keep paying for repairs due to a faulty engine that they refuse to fix.
What component or system failed or malfunctioned, and is it available for inspection upon request? ******Speed Control- Vehicle will stall while on road/ highway causing rear vehicles to brake.  How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk? *****Several times I was forced to pull over to side lanes to avoid being rear ended.   *****Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? I have called dealership several times in regards to this issue, all I was told was to do not use A/C or heater as that will make the vehicle lose power. Refused to conduct was full inspection of vehicle.   Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others?  *****No, no it has not been inspected   Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear?  *****No warning lamps not symptoms of the problem prior to the failure.
Ever since I got my car I’ve had black oil since the start . Second my car breaks on its own at times 3rd my car  system keep breaking down as the sparks leaking in some where has this issue since bought it 2 years ago low miles
The contact owns a 2018 Kia Optima. The contact stated that when the vehicle's oil will be as low as half a tank or lower the engine would suddenly stall. The vehicle would immediately regain power and function as expected. The failure occurred at various speeds with the highest speed being 60 mph. The contact had taken the vehicle to the dealer who diagnosed that there was fuel pressure pump failure. The vehicle had not been repaired. The contact received a letter stating that the manufacturer was well aware of the failure and have also created an extended warranty, however, they did not have the remedy. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 122,652.
Engine overhead and stopped working in addition to it consuming massive amounts of oil without physically putting oil in. I've went to 2 dealerships who refuse to provide me with a new engine even though I'm covered under the engine extension warranty due to me having the knock sensor update done. I am now involving my attorney and will go to the news channels to inform how kia manufacturer has become a disgrace with not providing quality engines in their vehicles and don't want to be responsible for it. there's already a settlement going on for kia optimas and other cars they've made because of faulty engines. They can better believe I'm coming for them next with a lawsuit.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2018 KIA OPTIMA. THE CONTACT STATED WHILE DRIVING 75 MPH, THE VEHICLE ABRUPTLY STALLED. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THERE WAS NO WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED. THE CONTACT COASTED THE VEHICLE UNTO THE ROAD SHOULDER AND RESTARTED THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE OPERATED AS INTENDED.  THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS PREVIOUSLY TAKEN TO ANCIRA KIA (6139 BANDERA ROAD, SAN ANTONIO, TX 78238, (210)684-4000) DUE TO THE HESITATION AND STALLING. THE DEALER REPLACED THE SPARK PLUGS AND CHANGED THE OIL HOWEVER, THE REPAIR DID NOT CORRECT THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER STATED THAT THE VIN WAS NOT INCLUDED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 17V224000 (ENGINE AND ENGINE COOLING). THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 72,800.
I HAVE THE KIA OPTIMA SX WITH THE TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE THAT COMES EQUIPPED WITH THE AUTO-LEVELING AND AUTO-BENDING LED HEADLAMPS. I BELIEVE THAT THE AUTO-LEVELING FUNCTION IS WORKING INCORRECTLY. WHEN WEIGHT IS ADDED TO THE CAR (MORE PASSENGERS) THE BEAM PATTERN AUTO ADJUSTS ITSELF TO POINT EVEN LOWER INSTEAD OF HIGHER. THIS CAUSES AN ADVERSE EFFECT.    THINK OF IT THIS WAY, THE BEAM HAS A DEFAULT SETTING TO WHERE IT POINTS TO WHEN THERE IS NO WEIGHT ADDED TO THE CAR. WHEN TWO PASSENGERS SIT IN THE CAR, THE BEAM SHOULD NOT POINT LOWER, INSTEAD IT SHOULD AUTO-LEVEL ITSELF TO A HIGHER POSITION TO ACCOMMODATE FOR THE FACT THAT THE VEHICLE IS NOW LOWER WHEN WEIGHT IS ADDED TO THE VEHICLE.     I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE HEADLIGHTS BY DEFAULT ARE POINTED A BIT LOW, I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP (CONCORD KIA IN CONCORD, CA) TO HAVE THEM RE-ADJUSTED. ALAS, NO BETTER RESULT WAS ACHIEVED DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE AUTO-LEVELING.     OFTEN WHEN DRIVING IN THE CAR WITH MY FIANCE (A COMBINED WEIGHT OF ABOUT 600 LBS DISTRIBUTED TO THE FRONT SEATS), THE LED LOW-BEAMS APPEAR TO REACH A MAX DISTANCE OF 40 FT ON LEVEL LAND, AND AROUND 70 FT. GOING UP A HILL. WHEN ONE IS GOING DOWNHILL, THE PROJECTED LED LIGHT REACHES A DISTANCE OF AROUND 25 FT.    I UNDERSTAND THAT THE 2017-2020 KIA OPTIMA SX MODELS EQUIPPED WITH THE AUTO-LEVELING AND AUTO-BENDING LIGHTS HAVE RECEIVED A FANTASTIC RATING. I AM SURE WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE WORKING AT OPTIMAL CONDITIONS (1 PERSON IN THE CAR WHO MAY WEIGH UNDER 200 LBS) THE LIGHTING CAN BE GREAT. HOWEVER, I ENCOURAGE THE NHSTA TO RE-CONDUCT A THOROUGH TEST UNDER THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:    SEAT TWO PEOPLE IN THE FRONT WHO WEIGH AT LEAST 200 LBS. FIRST SEAT ONE PERSON, NOTICE THE BEAM PATTERN AGAINST A WALL ABOUT 50 FT. AWAY, THEN SEAT ANOTHER PERSON IN THE VEHICLE AND NOTICE HOW THE BEAM PATTERN IS LOWERED.     I ALSO ENCOURAGE THE TESTERS TO DRIVE THE AROUND A BIT.
WHEN I GOT IN MY CAR THE CHECK ENGINE CAN ON. I STARTED DRIVING MY CAR TO WORK, BECAUSE I WAS NOT SURE WHY THIS LIGHT CAME ON BECAUSE THIS WAS/IS A NEW CAR. I HAVE LESS THAN 19K MILES ON MY CAR. AS I ATTEMPTED TO GET ON THE HIGHWAY THE CAR REFUSED TO SPEED UP. THE MAX THAT I COULD DRIVE WAS 60 MPH. I HAD TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD BECAUSE MY CAR WOULD NOT PICK UP SPEED. SO I CALLED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT, WHO INFORMED ME THAT WHEN I BROUGHT MY CAR IN FOR AN OIL CHANGE IN JANUARY THAT THEY HAS PLACE A SAFTEY FEATURE ON MY CAR TO KEEP THE ENGINE FROM BLOWING UP. ACCORDING TO THE DEALERSHIP, THERE IS POSSIBLY SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE ENGINE, HOWEVER, THEY ARE STARTING OUT BY CHANGING THE WIRING FIRST. I CAN NOT EXPLAIN HOW DIFFERENT THIS DRIVES SINCE THE WIRES HAVE BEEN CHANGED. IT IS THE WORST DRIVE. THE CAR IS VERY LOUD IT DOES NOT PICK UP SPEED WHEN IT SHOULD AND IT DOES NOT SLOW DOWN AS FAST AS IT USE TO. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I AM HAVING ISSUES WITH THIS CAR AND SEEMINGLY EVERY TIME I TAKE IT IN FOR REPAIRS, THE CAR GETS WORST. I WILL NEVER EVER BUY A NEW/USED KIA AGAIN.
The engine appears to be consuming an abnormal amount of oil. There are no visible leaks or external damage, and the vehicle has not yet stalled or failed, but oil levels drop rapidly between oil changes. The engine is available for inspection upon request  Driving with low or empty oil levels risks sudden engine failure while in motion, which could lead to loss of power, stalling in traffic, or even a crash. The oil warning light came on and went off at regular intervals unexpectedly during driving this week, which prompted me to get it to my mechanic asap to avoid potential engine damage or failure. They performed an oil change (even though I had done it there for this same car only 2133 miles ago  NOT YET. I have contacted the dealership and have been advised to monitor the oil level or potentially conduct an oil consumption test. I have not yet received a formal diagnostic or confirmation from Kia or a third party.  Yes the vehicle was formally inspected by Gettel Kia of Bradenton on 14th Street for an engine stalling issue... Have experienced a stall only once since then  Yes. The oil warning light turned on (and off several times in 1 minute intervals) for the first time around 132011 miles. Upon the mechanic checking the dipstick, the oil level was significantly below minimum. No check engine light appeared. An oil change was performed only 2133 miles since the last one.  Additional Notes: I have discovered multiple similar reports from other 2016–2020 Kia Optima owners via online forums such as Reddit and Kia owner groups, suggesting this may be a widespread issue related to the GDI engine design. These cases often go unresolved until engine damage occurs.  I am requesting:  A formal oil consumption test A full engine inspection Repair or replacement if the issue is confirmed Consideration for goodwill or warranty extension due to potential manufacturing defect  I am maintaining oil top-off records and would be happy to provide them
Sometimes when I drive it will say my forward collision is blocked so it will disable but it normally shuts off. Tonight I'm driving on the freeway a steering wheel pops up then blind spot abs traction and a few more lights come on then it say check headlights those are dimming the radio is cutting off. The wipers aren't working but the car is still accelerating then all of a sudden the car goes from 55 to 0 the wheel locks and I have to coat to the side of the road.
The car is using oil like crazy and is not leaking anywhere out of the vehicle.  Stalling out while driving and then accelerating. Has completely lost power and rolled down an onramp.  Completely unsafe.  Took for diagnostic and they wanted to say I needed a new gas cap.  Replaced, still doing same thing.  Hesitant to start even and the alternator is less than a year old.
My 2019 KIA optima with 116,021 odometer on mileage. Stop in the middle of High Volume Traffic , Because of Software Issues , I suspect . All  Forward Collision Warning Detection , Also Rear Collision Warning Alerted on dashboard!!! Which Causes my Car to stop in the middle of Traffic Completely shut down. I was able to get my vehicle towed to KIA West Dealership Located in lithia Springs GA . I requested a diagnostic test and was informed by my service advisor and service manager that my vehicle has a burned out wire located in the left right rear sensors radar assembly, bumper area . Which will eventually have caused a fire or actually already did,  I asked how did it happen? I was told it just simply burnt out. !!!! I was told the assembly box junction box needed to be replaced, which I agreed at that moment in order to diagnose the vehicle. Second the electrical problem was revealed, which is the big problem now currently for 1 , the vehicle is not safe for a midsize sedan on public roads and highways the if this make and model car causes random fires. secondly the parts very expensive and suspicious. I’m currently still doing my investigation. Unfortunately I had to agree for the sensors to be replaced and fixed because personal reasons I need my vehicle to get back-and-forth to work, etc.. I’ve been in contact consumer regional services, No one is able to find a recall with my Vin number the car never been in a accident ever. I have a picture of the hazardous burned out wire the technician showed me as well. As they claimed randomly caught fire.
I was driving on the highway and my car started smoking. I got off at the next exit and black smoke started billowing out from under the hood. As soon as I opened the car door flames started coming out from under the hood. Entire engine was on fire
My 2019 Kia Optim is starting to consume oil every 15 miles this is a problem that Kia have with thousands of 2019, 2020 and 2021 they have bad engines in them and Kia knows about the problem and refusing to do anything with the custom, you all need to make them have a recall and fix the problem with all those engines some vehicles only have 20,000 miles on them and have the same problem.
Refer to all the complaints of the pearl white paint flaking.  I am filing another complaint and the dealership is not helping.  Please help!  https://www.google.com/search?q=kia+pearl+white+paint+recall&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS970US971&oq=kia+perl+white+pai&aqs=chrome.2.69i57j0i13l2j0i22i30l7.6591j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8.
WAS DRIVING ON I 95 WHEN THE VEHICLE PULLED ME INTO THE MEDIAN TOTALING MY CAR.  I WAS UNABLE TO APPLY BRAKES AND UNABLE TO TURN MY STEERING WHEEL IN THE OTHER DIRECTION TO AVOID THE COLLISION.
I BOUGHT MY 2019 OPTIMA BRAND NEW BACK IN NOVEMBER. IT IS NOW JUNE AND I HAVE HAD IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP 3 TIMES FOR RANDOMLY NOT STARTING ON ME.  I GET THE SAME ANSWER EVERY TIME.  THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, NOTHING COMES UP ON THE COMPUTER WHEN THEY PLUG IT IN.  THEY SAY, "IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN, CALL US AND WELL TAKE IT IN".  BUYING THIS CAR BRAND NEW AND MY PAYMENTS BEING THAT OF A RANGE ROVER, I AM EXTREMELY UPSET.  TO TOP IT OFF, THE BACK WINDSHIELD IS SLIPPING DOWN.  I AM OVER THIS CAR AND I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER KIA AGAIN.  BUT, MY FIGHT IS NOT OVER, SOMETHING WILL HAVE TO BE DONE.   IT ALSO HESITATES AT TIMES, FEELS AS THOUGH IT IS STRUGGLING TO GO.  ALSO, TWO TIMES WHILE I WAS DRIVING THE CAR, THE DASH LIT UP WITH ALMOST EVERYTHING LIKE, I WAS IN A CRASH, THE EXCLAMATION POINT, ETC.
I bought my car brand new in July of 2020. In Spetember of 2023 roughly around 60,000 miles the engine started consuming large amounts of oil.  The dealership put me through the so-called warranty process 3x over a years' time. They refused to file warranty paperwork within the year I was going through the process.  I have documentation clearly showing the engine burning 2 qtrs. every 1000 miles. I still have a car that I am paying on that needs a new engine that should have been replaced under warranty, but KIA failed to honor the warranty.  I have been left stranded on the side of the road multiple times with my 3 children needing oil. Not to mention the car will lock by itself with it running and no one in the car. The screen where the radio is will just go blank.
I was driving on the high way and the car loose power completely have to do change oil every two weeks and can’t find a solution
Engine is burning 1-2 quarts of oil per week. I work from home so it only get driven once or twice a week max. I’m still making payments on a car that is unsafe to drive, eating oil, and running potential for the engine to lock up due to it being the exact same engine with the exact same issues as what is in prior years but for some reason to 2020 was not included in the recall. I am a single mother of 4 and can’t afford to put thousands of dollars worth of work into this car, that’s why I bought newer for reliability and  I can’t even confidently put my kids in this car and am stuck with it for another 4 years. Kia needs to address this!!
Car burns through 3 quarts of oil per week with just normal usage. Confirmed there are no oil leaks.
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO USE THE BRAKE PEDAL IF THE SHOE SIZE IS US10+.   THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE FLOOR AND THE KNEE AIRBAG MECHANISM DOES NOT ALLOW THE USE OF THE BRAKE PEDAL.
I WAS DRIVING MY TYPICAL ROUTE TO WORK AND MID TURN, WITH MY CAR ON, ON A CITY ROAD, MY STEERING WHEEL LOCKED. I HAD TO STOP MY CAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND RESTART IT TO GET IT TO UNLOCK. VERY SCARY THING TO HAPPEN, VERY WORRIED IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN IN A MORE DANGEROUS PLACE, LIKE THE FREEWAY.
WIRING CONNECTOR CONNECTED TO THE RADIATOR FAN ASSEMBLY MELTED.  I HAD REPLACED THE RADIATOR FAN ASSEMBLY A YEAR EARLIER TO ITS FAILURE.  UPON THE REPAIR SHOP I TOOK MY CAR TO CALLING THE DEALER, IT WAS MENTIONED THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM BY THE DEALER.  THE MELTING OF THIS CONNECTOR CAUSED THE ENGINE TO START OVER HEATING AND THE A/C TO NO LONGER COOL.  DEALER MENTIONED THAT THE CONNECTOR IS NOT AVAILABLE AND IT WOULD TAKE REPLACING THE WHOLE ELECTRICAL HARNESS.  THE CAR ONLY HAS ABOUT 65,000 MILES ON IT.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 KIA SOUL. WHILE OPERATING THE AIR CONDITIONING, THE FRONT DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE WINDOWS BECAME FOGGED.

THE TECHNICIAN INDICATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS OPERATING AS NORMAL. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 2,000.
DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING CAR ON SIDE STREET WHEN SHE NOTICED SMOKE AND THEN FIRE COMING FROM PASSENGER SIDE SPEAKER/LIGHT AREA.  SHE WAS FORTUNATELY NOT HURT AND WAS ASSISTED BY BYSTANDER IN PUTTING OUT FIRE.  INSIDE OF DOOR AROUND SPEAKER MELTED.  APPEARS TO BE SAME PROBLEM THAT KIA RECALLED 2010 KIA FOR (REF 10V388000 AUG 30 2010).  CAR WAS SUPPOSEDLY FIXED UNDER RECALL NO. 10V388000 AT FULLERTON KIA (NO LONGER IN BUSINESS AT THE FULLERTON LOCATION).  TO DATE KIA HAS ACCEPTED NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROBLEM.  I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CAUSE IS INVESTIGATED BEFORE CAR IS REPAIRED, AND REASON IS DESTROYED AS IT APPEARS RECALL FIX WAS UNSUCCESSFUL AND THERE MAY BE 1000'S OF CARS ON THE ROAD WITH SAME PROBLEM.   *TR  UPDATED 03/06/12 *BF  UPDATED IVOQ 03/13/12    *KB
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 KIA SOUL.  THE CONTACT WAS DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 5 MPH WHEN THE VEHICLE ABNORMALLY ACCELERATED FORWARD UNTIL THE CONTACT APPLIED THE BRAKES.

THE FAILURE AND CURRENT MILEAGE WAS 4,100.
DOOR SKINS AND PILLARS SCRATCH TOO EASILY. MAJOR SOURCE OF DEEP SCRATCHES IS DUE TO THE MERE TOUCHING OF THE SEAT BELT BEING RETRACTED. OTHER SCRATCHES CAN BE CAUSED BY TOUCHING THESE INTERIOR PARTS. THESE PLASTIC PARTS ARE INFERIOR AND DEFECTIVE AND SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH THE NEWER IMPROVED AND RELEASED REPLACEMENTS. *TR
This vehicle had just passed a inspection for me to get it licensed and Kentucky. There was no light showing that the airbags would not work. Unfortunately, this vehicle is not available.I had reached out to kia multiple times. My fears I have another Kia the same year.
The contact owns a 2011 Kia Soul. The contact received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 23V652000 (Service Brakes, Hydraulic).

Driving 36 mph and got hit in drive side and the airbags didn't deploy
IN THE 9 YEARS SINCE PURCHASE I'VE REPLACED MY HEADLIGHTS 13 TIMES. THEY GENERALLY BURN OUT WITHIN A MONTH OF EACH OTHER SO NOW I JUST REPLACE BOTH WHEN ONE GOES OUT. I HAVE TO KEEP SPARES IN THE GLOVE BOX BECAUSE ON ONE OCCASION THEY BOTH WENT OUT ON THE SAME DAY.
I WAS DRIVING MY CAR ON THE FLORIDA TURNPIKE AT ABOUT 70 MILES AN HOUR SHE. IT STARTED MAKING A LOUD CLANKING NOISE. THEN THE OIL LIGHT CAME ON, THE CAR IMMEDIACY MADE A LOUD POP, LIKE A GUN SHOT AND THEN THE ENGINE SHUT OFF WHILE DRIVING. I COASTED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WHERE I WAS STRANDED FOR AWHILE. I DID GET A TOW TO A MECHANIC WHO LOOKED AT THE CAR AND SAID THE MOTOR WAS BLOWN.  I WAS NOT ABLE TO GET MY CAR FIXED IN FLORIDA SO I BROUGHT IT BACK TO GEORGIA WHERE I RESIDE.  A MECHANIC IN VWRGIA CURRENTLY HAS THE CAR AND AGREES THE MOTOR IS BLOWN.  HE REMOVED THE OIL PAN AND THE CAR DOES HAVE OIL. BELIEF IS THAT THE OIL PUMP FAILED CAUSING CATASTROPHIC ENGINE FAILURE.  VEHICLE HAS HAD NO MECHANICAL PROBLEMS AT ALL AND I HAVE BEEN THE ONLY OWNER OF THIS CAR SINCE PURCHASE IN 2011. AWFULLY STRANGE THAT THE 2012 MODELS ARE UNDER RECALL WITH THE SAME ENGINE SIZE BUT NOT THE 2011. THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED ON  FEBRUARY 21. 2019.
REPLACED BOTH BALL JOINTS.  HEAT SHIELD IS VIBRATING WHILE ACCELERATING.   ALSO HAVE OIL PAN LEAK, CAUSING A PUDDLE IN THE DRIVEWAY.
3 PROBLEMS :#1 THE WHEEL PRESSURE LIGHT STAYS ON WHEN IDLE AND WHEN I'M DRIVING IT BUT, MY TIRES ARE AT THE SAME PSI. MAKES ME KEEP THINKING SOMETHING IS WRONG.  #2 IN THE WINTER TIME THE RUBBER MOLDING AROUND DOORS STICKS BAD AND STARTS TO PULL ITSELF AWAY FROM THE GLUE KEEPING IT ON.  #3 DURING THE WINTER MY WINDSHIELD KEEPS ICING UP REALLY BAD (ON THE INSIDE !). I CAN ACTUALLY USE MY ICE SCRAPER ON IT. I EXPECT THIS ON THE OUTSIDE OF A CAR BUT, I HAVE NEVER HAD A CAR DO THIS ON THE INSIDE, DID THEY FORGET TO SEAL IT CORRECTLY?
THE ESC ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS CAME ON WHILE DRIVING ON DRY ROAD BETWEEN 30 AND 55 MPH. TRIED TURNING PUSHING THE ON/OFF ECS SWITCH, BUT LIGHT WOULD NOT GO OFF.  WITH VEHICLE STOPPED, SHIFTING TRANSMISSION WHILE PUSHING ON BRAKE PEDAL, ESC LIGHT WOULD NOT GO OFF. TURNED OFF ENGINE, WAITED A FEW MINUTES THEN RESTARTED, LIGHT CAME BACK ON.  LIGHT WENT OFF AFTER DRIVING A FEW FEET AND STOPPING AT TRAFFIC LIGHT. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT DAMAGE OR PROBLEMS THIS MAY CAUSE TO THE OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES OF THE VEHICLE. IF IT HAPPENS ONE MORE TIME, AS I SUSPECT IT WILL, I WILL CONTACT THE DEALER.  *TR

THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 3,000.
We have tried multiple times to obtain information on this recall. My husband was finally told we must travel over 240 miles for this procedure. This would include two separate trips to Eugene. The first trip for the diagnosis and the second trip for the remedy "if it needs it". Every person at the dealership told my husband a different story and he finally gave up.  We are older and we do not travel anymore. We do not have the internet. I am hoping you can help in some way. This is a huge inconvenience, not to mention the cost of gas. Any help would be appreciated.

The contact's daughter owns a 2012 Kia Soul. The contact stated while her daughter was driving at an unknown speed, the check engine warning light illuminated, and the vehicle started making abnormal sounds before stalling. The vehicle was not drivable. The owner and a friend pushed the vehicle a short distance to the friend's residence. The contact stated an independent mechanic arrived at the location of the vehicle but was unable to determine the cause of the failure. The independent mechanic informed the contact that the vehicle failure was associated with NHTSA Campaign Number: 19V120000 (Engine, Engine and Engine Cooling). The contact spoke to the manufacturer and made them aware of the failure and was informed that the VIN was included in the recall. The contact towed the vehicle first to the residence and then to the local dealer, where it was diagnosed with needing the engine to be replaced. The manufacturer informed the contact that due to the failure mileage; the vehicle was not covered under the recall. The vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was 222,114.
We were driving and the car just shutdown, luckily at a stop sign.  Wouldn't turn back on, and nothing when we tried to jump it.  Had it towed to the nearest service center in town and were told a rod punctured the block and the engine is blown.  The service center said they had seen this happen before and to contact a Kia dealership to check on a recall. I talked to the Kia dealership in Topeka, KS and they said Kia had been denying requests to replace the engine, if the recall update had not been done. We never received any information about the car having a recall or needing an update, so therefore it was never performed.
The contact owns a 2012 Kia Soul. The contact stated that while driving at an undisclosed speed, the steering wheel made clicking sounds. The vehicle was taken to the dealer where it was diagnosed that the rack and pinion and steering column needed to be replaced. The contact declined the rack and pinion and steering column replacements. The vehicle was then taken to Turnersville Kia (2900 NJ-42, Sicklerville, NJ 08081) where it was diagnosed that the steering flexible coupling needed to be replaced. The vehicle was repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure and a case was opened. The failure mileage was approximately 50,000.

Sound coming from the engine check engine light on , I took the car to the Kia dealership and they refuse to fix it even with that recall SC176 , thank you
I purchased the 2012 Kia Soul on 12-18-20 and I had vehicle less than a week and it was losing power so I parked it until I could get it looked at on approx 02-03-21 the engine was disassembled by mechanic and found catalytic converter stopped up and piston failure after that time I found out about recall we contacted Kia about issue and was told they would not look at it because it is not driveable to take to Kia and they would not honor recall because cop ecu was not updated well engine already failed so we couldn't drive it there and recall said they would inspect vehicle and repair up to changing engine if necessary but they wouldn't even look at this one because engine had already failed and my vin number is under recall. I don't think this is right.
UPON MY LAST SERVICE AT THE DEALERSHIP THEY TOLD ME MY OIL WAS LOW. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME EVER HAVING TO ADD OIL. I CONTINUED TO MONITOR THE ISSUE. LAST WEEK WE DROVE THE CAR APPROX 50 MILES HOME. THE NEXT MORNING THE CAR WOULD NOT START AT ALL. WE HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALER AND THEY TOLD ME THE ENGINE IS GONE. THE CAR HAS 97,000 MILES AND HAS BEEN MAINTAINED MYSELF FOR THE LAST 6 YEARS USING SYNTHETIC OIL.

MY UVO  RADIO IS FINE 1 DAY AND THE NEXT DAY IT NO LONGER HAS SOUND AND THE CLOCK DOESN'T WORK, I HAVE DONE A HARD RESET WITH NO RESULTS.  WHEN RESEARCHING HOW TO FIX, I FIND OUT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE KIA SOULS, WHY ISN'T THERE A RECALL FOR SO ,ANY COMPLAINTS ?  I JUST GOT IN IT 1 DAY TO LEAVE HOME AND IT NO LONGER WILL WORK.. THE BACK UP CAMERA HASN'T WORKED FOREVER AND I BOUGHT THIS KIA BRAND NEW AND IN 2019 WHEN I WAS WASHING THE KIA AT THE CAR WASH THE COVER OF THE BACKUP CAMERA FELL OFF AND THEIR IS CORROSION ALL OVER IT, I WOULD THINK FROM A FAULTY SEAL
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 KIA SOUL. THE CONTACT RECEIVED A RECALL NOTIFICATION FOR NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 19V120000 (ENGINE, ENGINE AND ENGINE COOLING). THE CONTACT CALLED RUSTY WALLACE KIA OF KNOXVILLE (701 CALLAHAN DR, KNOXVILLE, TN 37912, (865) 688-8886) AND SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT; HOWEVER, THE CONTACT MISSED THE APPOINTMENT. WHILE DRIVING, THE CONTACT NOTICED A LARGE AMOUNT OF BLUE SMOKE COMING FROM THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE AND THE CHECK ENGINE WARNING INDICATOR ILLUMINATED. THE CONTACT CONTINUED DRIVING TO HER DESTINATION. THE VEHICLE WAS LATER TOWED TO THE CONTACT'S RESIDENCE WHERE HER HUSBAND AND SON NOTICED A HOLE IN PISTON NUMBER TWO. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE SAME DEALER, BUT WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE STILL REMAINED AT THE SAME DEALER WHERE THEY FAILED TO HONOR THE RECALL. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE AND PROVIDED CASE NUMBER: 13379468. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 116,000.
WE RECEIVED A RECALL LETTER FROM KIA, RECALL NUMBER 19V120. THE MORITZ DEALERSHIP REPLACED THE COP ECU LOGIC. WITHIN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS THE CAR COMPLETELY STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC AND WAS TOWED BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE DEALERSHIP CALLED AND SAID WE NEED A NEW ENGINE, BUT HAVE REFUSED TO COVER IT UNDER RECALL 19V120. WHICH STATES THAT THE ENGINE MAY NEED TO BE REPLACED AT NO CHARGE TO THE CUSTOMER. THE KIA SOUL HAS BEEN TO THE DEALERSHIP BEFORE FOR JUST STOPPING IN THE ROAD. PUTTING MY DAUGHTERS IN DANGER EVERY TIME. ANY HELP I CAN GET GETTING THIS RESOLVED WITH KIA WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. I AM NOT SURE HOW MANY CUSTOMERS ARE NOT GETTING THIS RECALL HONORED, BUT KIA SHOULD WANT THEIR CUSTOMERS TO BE SAFE DRIVING THEIR VEHICLES.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 KIA SOUL. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THERE WAS AN ABNORMAL CLICKING SOUND COMING FROM THE VEHICLE. THE DEALER (HUTCHINSON AUTO MALL, 3989 RIVER PLACE DRIVE, MACON, GA 31210, 478-757-2177) INDICATED THAT THEY REPAIRED THE VEHICLE PER NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 19V120000 (ENGINE AND ENGINE COOLING); HOWEVER, THE REMEDY FAILED TO PROVIDE A PERMANENT REPAIR. AFTER THE REPAIR, THE VEHICLE EXPERIENCED REDUCED ENGINE POWER AND THE CLICKING NOISE CONTINUED. THE CONTACT LATER RECEIVED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY CAMPAIGN. A LOANER VEHICLE OPTION WAS NOT PROVIDED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS NOT AVAILABLE.
WHEN YOU TURN THE STEERING WHEEL IT'S MAKING A CLICKING SOUND AND EVERY TIME YOU GO OVER A BUMP IT MAKES THE STEERING WHEEL SHAKE
THE STEERING WHEEL MAKES A KNOCKING NOISE WHEN TURNING AND WHEN STATIONARY. THE STEERING WHEEL FEELS LIKE IT'S MOVING ON IT'S OWN, I HAVE TO HOLD IT VERY STEADY TO KEEP CONTROL. I INQUIRED ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND WAS TOLD THE STEERING COUPLER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED, AND IT WOULD COST $200. THIS IS CLEARLY A DEFECT IN THESE MODEL CARS BASED ON THE VOLUME OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME THING. I STARTED NOTICING IT AROUND 70K MILES. THIS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AS A RECALL. IT'S A SAFETY ISSUE.
2012 KIA SOULWITH 15,000 MILES: STEERING MAKES A CLUNKING NOISE AND HAS A LOT OF PLAY IN IT. EVEN WHEN SITTING STILL. WHEN DRIVING IT ALSO HAS PLAY AND MAKES CLUNKING NOISE. TOOK IT TO DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THE COUPLER IS BAD, AND THAT ITS A COMMON PROBLEM.  THE FEE TO FIX IS $200, AND NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY BECAUSE I'M NOT THE ORIGINAL OWNER, EVEN THOUGH THE MILEAGE IS SO LOW. OTHER KIA SOULS HAVE RECALLS, THIS YEAR SHOULD AS WELL.
KNOCKING SOUND WHEN TURNING STEERING WHEEL SLIGHTLY TO EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT.  I WAS TOLD IT IS A BAD COUPLER WITHIN THE STEERING COLUMN THAT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AND IT WILL PROBABLY BECOME A RECALL BECAUSE THE DEALERSHIP HAS HAD MANY CUSTOMERS WITH THE SAME ISSUE.
I STOPPED MY CAR AT TOP OF MY STEEP DRIVEWAY,PULLED UP EMERGENCY BRAKE,PUT CAR IN PARK BUT LEFT CAR RUNNING TO LISTEN TO SONG ON RADIO. I SAW A PROBLEM IN MY YARD,OPENE THE DOOR, TOOK CARE OF PROBLEM THEN GOT PARTIALLU BACK IN THE CAR TO CUT OFF ENGINE. AS SOON AS I SWITCHED OFF THE ENGINE THE CAR STARTED ROLLING BACKWARDS, STILL IN PARK WITH THE EMERGNCY BRAKE UP AND MY LEFT LEG DRAGGING THE GROUND AS IT ROLLED ACROSS THE STREET AND INTO MY NEIGHBORS BEDROOM. IT IS A VERY COSTLY ACCIDENT. ALL WAS FINE UNTIL I CUT OFF THE ENGINE SO I THINK THAT CUTTING OFF THE ENGINE CAUSE A GLITCH IN THE ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION TO CAUSE IT TO GO INTO NEUTRAL WHILE STILL SHOWING IN PARK.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 KIA SOUL. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE THE DRIVER WAS GOING NORTH ON THE OUTSIDE LANE AT AN INTERSECTION WITH THE GREEN TRAFFIC SIGNAL, ANOTHER VEHICLE DRIVING SOUTH MADE A LEFT TURN AND CRASHED INTO THE FRONT OF THE DRIVERS VEHICLE. THE DRIVERS SIDE AIR BAG DEPLOYED WITH FORCE AS WELL AS FRAGMENTS AND A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE THAT DAMAGED THE CONTACTS LEFT HAND. THE DRIVER ALSO SUSTAINED BRUISING AND BURNS TO THE BUST AND CHEST. THE INJURIES SUSTAINED FROM THE IMPACT OF THE AIR BAGS REQUIRED FURTHER MEDICAL TREATMENT. A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO A IMPOUND LOT AND TO BE INSPECTED AND DIAGNOSED TO DETERMINE THE FAILURE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS NOT AVAILABLE.
THIS IS A RECURRING ISSUE WHICH KIA CAN'T IDENTIFY OR TROUBLESHOOT.  IT HAS BEEN IN THE KIA GARAGE HALF A DOZEN TIMES AND STILL HASN'T BEEN FIXED.  THE ISSUE HAPPENS WHEN THE VEHICLE IS INITIALLY STARTED.  THE STATUS LIGHTS IN THE DASH ALL LIGHT UP AND GO OUT ONE BY ONE WHEN SYSTEMS ARE CONFIRMED GOOD, EXCEPT THE ELECTRONIC ASSIST STEERING AND ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL LIGHTS STAY LIT.  THE ELECTRONIC ASSIST POWER STEERING DOES NOT WORK AS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN THE WHEEL EVEN IF THE VEHICLE IS PUT INTO GEAR AND DRIVEN FORWARD OR BACKWARDS.  YOU HAVE TO TURN THE IGNITION OFF AND RESTART THE VEHICLE TO RESET EVERYTHING AND THEN IT IS FINE.  KIA WAS CALLED OUT TO A PARKING LOT AT ONE POINT WHILE THE SYSTEMS FAILED AND THEY HOOKED UP THEIR DIAGNOSTICS TO THE PORT AND WERE UNABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE VEHICLES COMPUTER SYSTEM IN ORDER TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD TO TRACK THIS ISSUE AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE UNTIL THE SYSTEM TOTALLY FAILS AND REFUSES TO RESET.  DIAGNOSTICS DOES NOT PICKUP THE ERROR WHEN IT OCCURS AND THE VEHICLES INTERNAL COMPUTER DOES NOT REGISTER THE FAILURE EITHER.  *TR
MY SON WAS SITTING IN THE RIGHT REAR SEAT OF A 2012 KIA SOUL WHEN IT WAS REAR ENDED BY A HONDA CRV GOING 35-40 MPH. THE IMPACT PUSHED THE KIA INTO THE SUBARU IN FRONT OF THEM SETTING OFF BOTH AIRBAGS IN THE FRONT. THE SEAT BELT MY SON WAS WEARING DID NOT LOCK OR RETRACT. HE HIT HIS HEAD ON THE BACK HEADREST WENT FORWARD INTO THE HEADREST ON THE FRONT SEAT AND THEN BACK INTO HIS HEADREST. THE SEAT BELT DID NOTHING TO RESTRAIN HIS MOVEMENT DURING THE ACCIDENT. THE KIA WAS TOTALED BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY.  *TR
NOT SURE IF MODEL IS 2012 OR 2011. A KIA SOUL WAS IN FRONT OF ME AT A STOP LIGHT. THE STOP LIGHTS ON THE VEHICLE WERE SO BRIGHT AS TO ALMOST BLIND ME. IS THERE A NATIONAL STANDARD THAT LIMITS THE MAXIMUM LIGHT ON BRAKE TAILLIGHTS?  *TR
On [XXX], we were driving on [XXX] from Wisconsin into Minnesota to park at MSP airport. Near the state border, we began to hear a clunk sound in the steering column. We chose to park the car at a friend's home near the airport in her garage in case we needed service upon our return from Texas where we travelling to. Prior to driving back to our home from Minneapolis on [XXX] (1.5 hours), we checked with our local mechanic to see if it were safe to drive. He could not diagnose over phone, but suggested coupling issue and that we drive carefully. We made it back home,  took car to our local mechanic on 7 October, and thought it would be better to check dealership in Eau Claire, WI (another 30 minute drive). We drove there, slowly, on 18 October, and were told that it was probably the MDPS/Flexible Coupling, but that it would cost us 175 to check, and another 250-300 to replace the 15.00 part. We drove home and had a family emergency out of state and will return now to Wisconsin soon and want to get this fixed as soon as possible. We understand NOW that this is a persistent problem for MANY KIA 2013 Soul and other KIAs and that NHTSA has been supportive to some owners over this matter.  We do not object to paying for the repair, but not at price-gouging levels. From what we understand, the inspection needed to check for the flex coupling is not difficult nor time consuming. We are afraid to drive the car for safety sake, but we need the car to drive!   Do we have any rights to a free inspection if this is a problem with many KIAs? There were no warning lights and  no symptoms prior to the sudden noise and now there is a persistent and regular clunk when the steering wheel is moved.   Thank you for any information regarding this issue. Again, no accident and no injuries or results from clunk, but KIA history seems to suggest a potential recall need.

I got a recall letter in the mail too late! (October 2021) I received recall letter and called my local dealership 5 minutes after reading it & was told to put the letter in my glove box until my car completely broke down December 8th 2021. It was towed and was told it needed spark plugs & an oil chance which I knew wasn't the case. It sat at that dealership for two months with every service advisor giving me the run around and come to find out I'm not the first person. Had it towed to a different location where it sat for another two months where I had to fight to get a "goodwill" engine which we still paid almost $4,000 when it should of been for free! I got my car back March 31st 2022 and now my car had failed again! Am being told it's something different now & the STEALERSHIP wants another $1,500 from me! My child has had to miss dr appointments due to this and I've jad enough! Kia customer service is incompetent and Kia dealership service departments are as well! Due to the fact my engine should of been replaced for free like everyone else but someone decided to send me the recall letter LATE!
Purchased used 2013 Kia Soul July 2018. June 2019, vehicle was taken to Kia Dealership for SC176-19V120 ECU Logic Upgrade.  Neither catalytic converter nor engine were replaced during recall repair. In 2020, vehicle began consuming oil and poor mileage.  No smoke or leak detected.  Had vehicle inspected by local mechanic, who could not find pooled oil or a leak.

Oct 2021 Campaign PI2002A Knock Sensor software update to ECU was performed by local Kia dealership with no other repairs performed. Feb 2022, visible oil leaking from beneath car and check engine light.  Local mechanic diagnosed CodE P0420 Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold (Bank 1), and heard engine knocking. Recommended replace catalytic converter and reprogram ECU for short term fix, followed by engine replacement due to wear and damage from catalytic converter.  Suggested I contact dealership who performed recall repairs to see about warranty or replacement of engine due to recall repairs failing to correct faulty engine issues.

2013 KIA SOUL 1.6L GDI. 77650 MILES.   PROBLEM 1 .TWO DAYS AGO WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STARTED FLASHING AND I COULD TELL IT WAS HAVING A LOT OF HESITATION, EVEN BEFORE IT FLASHED I COULD NOTICE SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT. I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO MY LOCAL KIA DEALERSHIP AND THEY RAN A DIAGNOSTIC ON MY CAR AND COULD TELL THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH CYLINDER 2. DESPITE THAT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN AND I WAS TOLD TO KEEP DRIVING THE VEHICLE UNTIL I HAPPENED AGAIN.    2. I'VE BEEN NOTICING MY CAR IS ALWAYS LOW ON OIL. LAST TIME I HAD MY OIL CHANGED THEY TOLD ME THEY COULDN'T EVEN MEASURE ANY OIL ON THE DIPSTICK. NOW YESTERDAY WHEN I WAS AT THE DEALERSHIP SAME ISSUE. IT'S ONLY BEEN 2K MILES SINCE MY LAST SERVICE AND IT WAS ALMOST 3/4OF A QT LOW. I KNOW IT'S NORMAL FOR SOME OIL TO BURN BUT THAT'S WAY TOO MUCH TOO QUICKLY.    3. YESTERDAY ONLY 1 DAY AFTER MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT FLASHED I NOTICED A REALLY BAD SMELL COMING FROM MY CAR WHEN I GOT OFF THE HIGHWAY. I'D DESCRIBED IT AS A HOT TIN/SULFER SMELL. NOW I'M WORRIED TO EVEN DRIVE THIS CAR AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I JUST READ ABOUT THE RECALL FOR THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER OVERHEATING AND CAUSING OIL LEAKAGE. MY VIN IS NOT SHOWING UNDER THE RECALL BUT MY CAR IS LOSING OIL AND THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  THE MECHANIC SAYS IT IS GIVING THE CODE FOR THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER. MY CAR IS ALSO LOSING POWER AND I CAN HEAR A NOISE UNDER THE HOOD THAT SOUNDS LIKE METAL HITTING METAL. THE RECALL SAYS IT INCLUDES THE 2013 KIA SOUL WITH THE 1.6 ENGINE AND I'M WONDERING IF MINE WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.
MY CAR HAS 55K MILES ON IT. I PURCHASED IT OCTOBER 2013.  THE STEERING COUPLING JUST WENT BAD AND NOW I HAVE TO PAY $500 FOR THE REPAIR. THIS COMPLAINT SEEMS TO BE PREVALENT WITH THIS VEHICLE.  IT SHOULD BE A RECALL. ALSO, THE PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW WILL NOT GO BACK UP WITH DRIVER'S SIDE CONTROL.  THE DEALER IS TELLING ME THAT THAT IS ALSO OUT OF WARRANTY AND THAT IT WILL $350 FOR THE REPAIR.  I'M CONFUSED... HOW CAN NONE OF THIS BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY?  PLUS, I'M STILL WAITING FOR KIA MILES PER GALLON SETTLEMENT FROM 4 YEARS AGO.  IF THIS IS THEY WAY THEY OPERATE, I'LL NEVER BUY ANOTHER ONE.

WHILE DRIVING THE CAR ON 5/14/17 THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND THE NOISE PERSISTED. THOUGH THE CAR WAS STILL DRIVABLE, I HAD IT TOWED TO THE KIA DEALERSHIP ON 5/15/17 WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT. LATER THAT DAY I WAS TOLD THAT THE MOTOR HAD GONE OUT IN MY CAR WHEN I ASKED WHY I WAS TOLD THAT THE MECHANIC HAD LEFT. THE FOLLOWING DAY ON 5/16/17 I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP BACK AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE SLUDGE IN MY MOTOR CAUSED FROM OIL BEING BURNED IN THE MOTOR AND THE SLUDGE WAS NOT ABLE TO FILTER THOUGH THE MOTOR. I WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY $4220 TO REPLACE IT WITH A USED MOTOR. THE NEXT DAY ON 5/17/17 I WAS ONLINE LOOKING FOR CHEAPER MOTORS WHEN I RAN ACROSS ARTICLES REGARDING THE 2016 RECALL OF 600,000+ OTHER KIA VEHICLES ALL WITH DEFECTIVE ENGINES. AFTER READING WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OTHER ENGINES I REALIZED THAT THE SAME THING WAS HAPPENING TO MY ENGINE. I CALLED KIA CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE CENTER AND A CASE WAS MADE REGARDING MY CAR.

TODAY, ON 6/5/2017 BRENDA THE ESCALATION AGENT CALLED TO NOTIFY ME THAT KIA WOULD NOT COVER MY CAR BECAUSE IT HAS OVER 100K MILES ON IT AND BECAUSE THERE IS SLUDGE LOCATED IN THE ENGINE.

I have a re call on my 2014 kia soul my check engine light is on the reason is I'm having issues with my catalytic converter   I been asking for this repair to be done for over a month now kia has been giving me the round around
The contact owns a 2014 Kia Soul. The contact stated while driving approximately 35 MPH, the vehicle lost motive power while depressing the accelerator pedal. The contact stated that the check engine and check oil warning lights were illuminated. The contact self-diagnosed the vehicle and determined that the coil and the spark plugs needed to be replaced. The vehicle was repaired. The contact stated that the failure returned, and the vehicle was taken to the local dealer, where it was diagnosed and determined that the catalytic converter had failed and needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was informed of the failure. The contact researched online and related the failure to NHTSA Campaign Number: 19V120000 (Engine, Engine and Engine Cooling). The failure mileage was approximately 127,000.
I drove my car a short distance, parked, and turned off the engine. about 5 minutes after I left my car in the parking lot, we heard a loud explosion and everyone in the office stepped outside. My car became a ball of orange fire and burned for some time. It took 3 fire trucks to contain the fire and several other vehicles were damaged from the explosion. Pictures taken after the incident show the engine was gone (melted maybe). The inside of the car was also burned beyond recognition. My potential death was approximately 5 minutes after I parked my car. The gas tank did not explode; rather, the car burned from the front to the rear. This vehicle should not be on the road and the problem should be made public immediately.

My wife was involved in a traffic accident yesterday where she was not at fault, was hit, had on her safety belt, and her head hit the steering wheel of this car and she lost consciousness and has lacerations requiring stitches on her face. The airbag should have deployed in this case and did not.  I called 3 kia dealerships locally for several months since September 2022, requesting this warranty work be done, and they all refused to do the work by not scheduling me for a service appointment after repeated requests via telephone to each service department. They should have me in their computer system as having requested this work be done. Dealerships were DARCAR Kia Temple hills, Address: 4700 Branch Ave, Temple Hills, MD 20748, Koons Kia of Woodbridge, Address: 14208 Richmond Hwy, Woodbridge, VA 22191, and Ourisman Kia of Alexandria, Address: 8670 Richmond Hwy, Alexandria, VA 22309. I filed this complaint several weeks or months ago and nothing has been done.
The rear windshield in my 2014 Kia Soul shattered upon getting into it and just closing the driver’s side front door. The car had been parked for about 11 hours and was not running at the time - I hadn’t even started it yet. There was no sign or indication of anything or anyone hitting the window. I am now finding a number of posts online where this is happening. One person posted that their Kia Soul rear window shattered twice in 4 months! I live in Rhode Island and it is December so temperature shifts can be pretty extreme at times and my Kia is usually parked on the side of the road in full Sun. I’m just glad no one was hurt and this didn’t happen to me while driving on the highway. I am the second owner of the vehicle and I bought it with low mileage. I also pretty rarely open the hatch back and always try not to slam any of the doors although it does happen occasionally especially when joined by other passengers. This does appear to be a fairly widespread issue and I hope that Kia is forced to fully address it as it does pose a potentially dangerous safety issue.
The contact owns a 2014 Kia Soul. The contact stated she noticed that the driver’s side brake light bulb was inoperable. The bulb was replaced; however, the failure recurred several times. The vehicle was taken to the dealer to be diagnosed; however, no failure was found. The manufacturer was not contacted. The failure mileage was approximately 40,000.
Soon after buying my car used in 4/2021, I took the car into a KIA dealership to have the check engine light evaluated and asked for the open recalls to be addressed also. They didn't check the codes before doing the recalls and said the recalls performed cleared the codes and the check engine light was no longer on.   I then had my mechanic do a tune up of spark plugs and oil, lube and filter change. The car performed better but would randomly experience loss of power while on the highway or when accelerating from a stop as though it was chocking and ready to stall. The check engine light never came on during this time.   I have had to keep a very close eye on the oil level this whole year and there has not been any signs of a leak . But I have had to add a quart or more of oil approximately every 500 miles plus have the regular oil and filter changes. Also installed a new PCV valve. I have put 11,500 miles on the vehicle in one year.  Now one year later, I couldn't get the car to accelerate to highway speeds and yet no check engine light comes on. I took the car to another KIA dealer to have it diagnosed. The codes were showing misfires on multiple cylinders. And their diagnosis is that the catalytic converter and gaskets and O2 sensor need replaced plus the spark plugs need replaced because they are burnt. Also the fuel system needs serviced due to excessive carbon build up.  I have researched the recalls on the 2014 Kia Soul and see that there is a NHTSA campaign:19V120000 that addresses this same issue but somehow my VIN is not included. I am not able to have these repairs made (nearly $4000) and this car is just an accident waiting to happen. Why is my VIN not included in this known issue that already has a recall associated with my make and model?
The contact owns 2014 Kia Soul. The contact stated that while driving at unknown speeds, the front driver’s side tire pressure monitoring system would erroneously remain activated although the tire pressure was correct. The cause of the failure was not determined. The local dealer and manufacturer were notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 95,000.
The contact owns a 2014 Kia Soul. The contact stated that while driving at various speeds, the vehicle wobbled and hesitated to accelerate. Additionally, the vehicle was consuming excessive amounts of oil. The local dealer and Gurley Leep Kia (4028 Grape Rd, Mishawaka, IN 46545) were made aware of the failure. Both dealers informed the contact that the next available appointment was on December 20th. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. Upon investigation, the contact learned that there were two recalls associated with the VIN; NHTSA Campaign Number: 17V608000 (Steering) and 19V120000 (Engine, Engine and Engine Cooling). The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 90,000.
My dash lights would flash bright and dim randomly while driving at first. A few weeks later my headlights would flicker from high beam to low beam and dash lights would still flicker. Now about a month into this my headlights still flicker but they have even turned off all while driving and I was told my brake lights go off as well ,dash lights still flicker and my a/c will not work/blow randomly so it seems to be involving electrical .
The vehicle had a strange smell ever since we got it a few years back. Earlier in the month, the headlight and dashlight would flicker with the turn signal. We looked it up and set up an apppointment with a local Kia dealership for recall on this issue. Then this week, the engine suddenly quit while the car was parked. The vehicle wouldn't start at all. Kia was notified and they said that there was another recall on engine SC200 on this vehicle that was just announced earlier this year. Online lookup also revealed that the smell issue can be from burning oil or a leak into catalytic converter. Other Kia cars from the same years have also said to have had these issues. Then an OBD II check showed the codes 7E8 and 7E9 which has been noted online by other customers as engine problem recall for which Kia has replaced their engine free of charge.

I BOUGHT THE CAR MAY 28, 2019.  IN AUGUST, THE OIL LIGHT CAME ON SO I GOT AN OIL CHANGE; THE FIRST OF MANY.  BY JANUARY 2020, I HAD CHANGED THE OIL 5 TIMES, AND SUDDENLY THE CAR BEGAN TO DRASTICALLY SLOW ACCELERATION.  IT WOULD REV UP WHEN TRYING TO ACCELERATE AND WAS SLOW TO SHIFT GEARS.  IT TOOK A LOT OF EFFORT JUST TO GET IT UP TO A NORMAL SPEED AND IF GOING UP A HILL, IT WOULD DECELERATE.  I TOOK IT TO A KIA DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS A CRACK IN THE VALVE COVER GASKET, AND THE COILS AND SPARK PLUGS WERE DAMAGED DUE TO EXCESSIVE OIL SPATTERING.  THEY FIRST TRIED TO SAY IT WAS BECAUSE I DID NOT KEEP THE OIL CHANGED, BUT I WAS ABLE TO SHOW THEM JUST HOW OFTEN I HAD CHANGED IT.  THEY TOLD ME THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RED FLAG THAT THE ENGINE WAS BAD, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT AND THOUGHT I WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING BY KEEPING THE OIL CHANGED.  THEY REPLACED THE VALVE COVER GASKET, ALL COILS AND SPARK PLUGS BUT THE CAR MADE NO IMPROVEMENT.  AFTER I TOOK IT BACK AGAIN, I WAS THEN TOLD THE ENGINE WAS FAILING AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE IT WAS FULL OF SLUDGE.  I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE IT FOR FEAR OF IT CATCHING FIRE, AND THAT IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN.  *TR
I PURCHASED A 2014 KIA SOUL FROM DOUG SMITH AUTOPLEX ON 11-19-2019.   THE CAR PURCHASE INCLUDED A 3 MONTH/3,000 MILE WARRANTY  I CALLED IN ON 12-12-2019 TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT WITH SERVICE TO INSPECT A NOISE FROM THE ENGINE.  THE APPOINTMENT WAS SCHEDULED FOR 12-20-2019, I ADDED A QUART OF OIL TO THE ENGINE.     12-20-2019, I WENT TO THE APPOINTMENT. RICK LARSEN TEST DROVE THE CAR AND FILLED THE RADIATOR FLUID. RICK TOLD ME TO COME BACK IF THE NOISE RETURNED. RICK DID NOT RUN ANY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS.  THE SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT WAS COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY OFFERED AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE.  02-14-2020 I ADDED ANOTHER 1\2 QUART OIL AND FILLED THE WINDSHIELD FLUID.  A NOISE RETURNED TO THE ENGINE ON 02-20-2020. I CALLED AT 2PM ON TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT FOR SERVICE. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT SET THE APPOINTMENT FOR FRIDAY 02-21-2020.     THE ENGINE SEIZED WITH NO WARNING LIGHTS EVER COMING ON PRIOR TO IT SEIZING 02-20-2020 EVENING ON I-15 FREEWAY SOUTHBOUND @5:40PM.  THE KIA SOUL WAS IMMEDIATELY TOWED TO THE DOUG SMITH DEALERSHIP BY JOHN'S TOWING.   I WAS ACCUSED BY THE SALES MGR ED OF DOING A FAULTY JOB OF AN OIL CHANGE AND THAT THE OIL  HAD RUN OUT ALL OVER THE UNDERCARRIAGE. I WAS LATER TOLD BY THE SAME SALES MGR ED, THAT THE SEAL ON THE OIL PLUG AND FILTER HAD NEVER BEEN BROKEN.
I HEARD A KNOCKING NOISE IN MY ENGINE (66K). I HAD JUST CHANGED THE OIL 4 MONTHS AGO AND WAS DUE FOR AN 'OIL CHANGE 'SO CALMLY I WENT TO CHECK MY ENGINE AND I WAS MET WITH AN UNWELCOME SURPRISE, MY ENGINE WAS ABNORMALLY LOW ON OIL. I NEVER HAD ANY INCLINATION OIL WAS LEAVING AS I HAD NO TRACE OF LEAKS AND MY OIL LIGHT NEVER CAME ON INITIALLY I THOUGHT MAYBE I COULD JUST PUT SOME MORE OIL AND TAKE IT TO GET THE OIL CHANGED AND THE ISSUE WOULD BE OVER. I WAS TOLD BY FIRESTONE,  I SHOULD TAKE TO THE DEALER TO GET CHECKED SINCE IT MIGHT STILL BE UNDER WARRANTY. I DID DRIVE THE CAR HOME AND THEN TO THE DEALER BECAUSE I NOW HAD FRESH OIL AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THE ISSUE REMEDIED. IT TOOK THE DEALER OVER A WEEK TO HEAR BACK FROM THE TECH LINE, WITH ME CALLING CONSTANTLY TO GET AN UPDATE. ONLY TO BE TOLD THERE IS NOTHING COVERED BECAUSE I HAVE FRESH OIL IN MY ENGINE. IT WOULD COST ME $5,600 TO REPLACE THE ENGINE.I WAS LEFT WITH NO RECOURSE, SINCE I CANNOT TRADE, BUT TO HAVE THE ENGINE REPLACED AT MY OWN EXPENSE. I STARTED TO DO RESEARCH AND LEARNED THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FOR THE GDI MOTORS FAILING DUE TO FAULTY RODS. I DISCOVERED, MY RODS WERE SHOT AND EVENTUALLY AS I WAS DRIVING TO THE MECHANIC TO HAVE THE NEW ENGINE INSTALLED, SOMETHING SEEMED TO HAVE SHOT THROUGH MY OIL PAN CAUSING A HOLE IN OIL AND TOTAL ENGINE FAILURE, ON THE HIGHWAY. AT THIS POINT, I HAD TO CALL A TOW TRUCK AND ENDURED SAFETY HAZARDS ON THE HIGHWAY. I INITIALLY SAW NO POINT IN HAVING TOWED TO THE SHOP FOR ALMOST 30 MILES BECAUSE THAT WAS THE BEST DEAL, I COULD FIND TO INSTALL THE ENGINE I BOUGHT. I ALSO FOUND OUT I HAD TO HAVE MY CLUTCH REPLACED. THIS WHOLE SCENARIO CAUSED ME A GREAT DEAL OF STRESS, WORRY, AND FINANCIAL TROUBLE. I ENDED UP PAYING CLOSE TO $2,800 TO HAVE A USED GDI ENGINE INSTALLED.

TAKATA RECALL.. DRIVERS SIDE LOW BEAM KEEPS GOING OUT. PREVIOUSLY IT WOULD BE OUT ONE DAY THEN WHEN I WOULD START MY CAR IT WOULD COME BACK ON. IN THE PICTURE BOTH LIGHTS ARE WORKING BUT 5 MINS BEFORE ONLY THE PASSENGER SIDE WAS WORKING. THIS HAS BEEN AN GOING ISSUE FOR ABOUT 2 YEARS NOW. SOMETIMES I HAD TO REPLACE THE BULB AFTER IT BEING OUT FOR OVER A WEEK BUT THE BULB WAS NOT BLOWN.
HEADLIGHTS KEEP RANDOMLY FLICKERING OFF AND ON WHILE DRIVING.  STARTED OUT JUST WHEN I HAD MY LIGHTS ON AUTO AND HAD THE TURN SIGNALS ON.  LAST NIGHT THEY WENT OUT ON THEIR OWN WHILE I WAS DRIVING DOWN A DARK ROAD FOR SEVERAL SECONDS.  THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AND SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM.

The contact owns a 2015 Kia Soul. The contact stated that while driving at an undisclosed speed, the accelerator pedal was depressed; however, the vehicle failed to accelerate as intended. The contact stated the vehicle failed to accelerate above 20 MPH. The vehicle lost motive power and stalled. In addition, the contact stated that the vehicle was shaking abnormally. The vehicle was towed to the dealer and was diagnosed with engine failure. The contact was informed that the engine needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 75,000.
Earlier last year, we had suddenly had an issue with the Kia Soul. We received a check engine light and noticed a loud clicking noise as the vehicle began accelerating and noticed the vehicle had difficulty accelrating. We left the vehicle parked and then attempted to change the battery and oil to see if either were a contributing factor. When we noticed no improvement upon turning on the car, we took the vehicle to a licensed dealership: Arapahoe Kia to check the vehicle to diagnose the issue and help determine if this was covered under warranty.  On our drive (which was about 2 miles from where we had left the car, the engine seized so we had the vehicle towed there.  Once we got the diag back, they told us the code but wanted service records to honor the warranty from all oil changes in all states for the past 5 years or pay full cost of vehicle. No mention was made of the prior repaired recalls or determination if the cause could have been because of the unprepared recall that clearly states the syptoms and result being the exact problem we experienced. A few months later when we received notification from a different licensed dealer we had the unrepaired recall (in automated texts and emails), we called back Arapahoe Kia who still had the car, and they again stated service records would be needed to honor the NHTSA recall and also admitted they didn’t attempt to identify if the engine issue we had was caused by the unrepaired recall, as they only looked at the code and visual inspection of oil sludge, and treated it like a warranty claim to deny and did not validate the recall as the cause. But they still have refused to actually inspect the recall concern to determine if the engine trouble was caused by it and repair it as obligated if it was. Instead they keep asking us to pay for the full engine without validating root cause under the NHTSA recall.
My vehicle is burning oil, not leaking but burning oil. I’m having to put oil in it every 3-4 days. Also ever since they did a recall on the catalytic converter my check engine light has been on. When I’ve taken it to see the code it comes back my catalytic converter. I’m unable to drive my car.
The contact owns a 2015 Kia Soul EV. The contact stated that the vehicle was included in NHTSA Campaign Number: 23V218000 (Electrical System) and the vehicle was repaired under the recall. The contact stated that after the repair was completed, the vehicle went into "Reduced Power" and "Power Limp Mode" while driving at various speeds and initially after starting the vehicle. The vehicle was returned to the dealer where the recall repair was completed the recall repair; however, the dealer was unable to determine the cause of the failure. The vehicle had not been repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was 111,400.
The engine warning light and  catalytic converter malfunction. The car is not currently available for inspection. The car exploded after turning the engine over. The car became disabled on the busy highway while driving at night and the car exploded in flames thereafter.  Yes the problem was confirmed by the dealership  The vehicle was inspected by insurance representatives, fire dept and police  Yes the check engine light appeared several times, was checked and reappeared several times thereafter. I made a purchase of a car 9/15/23, The warning lamp appeared a few days later.
The KIA company is denying me the anti theft software. What can I do?
This is a supplement to the earlier filed report. The brakes on this Kia Soul did not appear to be working, no matter how hard I pressed on it. Further, I flew forward in this accident, causing me to hit my head. It was like the seatbelt was not working at all. I had to be checked for a potential concussion at the local hospital.
Excessive oil burning causing catalytic converted to be clogged and requiring relacement.  No oil leaks, no warning lamps, messages; car is driving sluggish.
The contact owns a 2015 Kia Soul. The contact stated that while her daughter was driving at highway speeds, an abnormal revving sound would emit from the vehicle as it hesitated upon depression of the accelerator pedal without warning. Despite the failure, her daughter managed to drive the vehicle home; the next day, the contact started the vehicle and experienced the same failure. The contact drove the vehicle to the dealer where it was diagnosed with a defective catalytic converter. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and the contact was informed that the vehicle was not included in NHTSA Campaign Number: 19V120000 (Engine, Engine and Engine Cooling). The vehicle was not repaired and remained in the possession of the dealer. The failure mileage was approximately 133,000.
Vehicle has begun burning oil excessively and has a smell of gas in the oil.  The oil is changed regularly with the correct oil.  This did not begin to occur until the vehicle had a recall issue resolved at the dealership.   The vehicle has 113,000 miles on it, a engine service light is on and and is throwing a P420 code. My mechanic provided me with the recall notices for the vehicle based on year however, a call to Kia indicates my VIN is not included in the second recall. I have noted there are mutiple compaints for the same issue on Kia owner sites on the web. The vehicle is beginning to have poor fuel comsumption, and is beginning to "drag" on occasion while driving at varied speeds both city and highway.
Engine consumes excessive amount of oil before next oil change that causes catalytic converter to clog and the car not to perform well. This is a known Kia issue and everyone should be eligible for the engine recall. This is dangerous and cars have been catching fire over this issue. Kia knows and they refuse to fix the issue for 2015 Kia soul + owners.
The contact owns a 2015 Kia Soul. The contact stated while driving approximately 10 MPH and making a right turn, the front passenger’s side wheel suddenly malfunctioned rendering the vehicle undrivable. The vehicle was towed to an independent mechanic who diagnosed that the front passenger’s side lower control arm had fractured due to faulty ball joint. The control arm was replaced but the vehicle started to experience vibration and shaking. The manufacturer and local dealer were not notified of the failure. The contact also indicated that the vehicle had experienced engine oil consumption issues. The cause of the failure was not determined. The failure mileage was 150,000.
While driving down the interstate, my car started sputtering, decelerating, and then cut off. I was able to get it back on long enough to get off the interstate. When I stopped, my car cut off. Turn it back on, sputter down the road, then engine knocking,  turn off. For about 15 miles. I finally got it towed to my Kia dealer and I explicitly told them about the recall. They had no idea what I was talking about so I called Kia. According to Kia, even though my car is on the recall list, I'm out of luck because I wasn't informed that it had to be done during a certain time. I'm not the original owner and never got notice and now I'm out of a car I am STILL paying on!
Catalytic converter, slipping gears, slowing down on hywy putting me at risk for rear end collision .  Has been inspected by manufacturer and been confirmed.  Saw recall on this on cars.com Engine light started  1 yr ago.
I’m not sure what system failed and yes my car is available for inspection. My safety was severely put at risk because something started to let smoke fill the cab of my car and it was so bad that I had to roll all the windows down which still I could barely breath. My hands went purple as well as my arms. I felt very sick and weird. No one has looked at my car but I have an appointment on the 2nd of feb. 2022. There wAs a check engine light on and I took it to Kia and they said it was throwing a partial code for the emissions something.
Engine failure on freeway 2 times in last 9 months. Engine rattles as if coming apart and almost complete loss of power. Had spark plugs replaced after both incidents for temporary fix. Mechanics informed me that 2015 KIA Soul engine have problems/issues. Engine is also burning oil. KIA dealer said it is "normal" for engine to burn oil with high mileage. (130,000 miles)
SOMETHING IS CAUSING THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER TO CLOG AND OVERHEAT, REDUCING GREATLY, THE POWER OF THE VEHICLE, PARTICULARLY WHEN TRAVELING UPHILL. I FEAR IT WILL BECOME HOT ENOUGH TO START A FIRE AND/OR DAMAGE THE PISTONS/ENGINE.

My 2015 Kia Soul is currently in the repair shop at Jim Marsh Kia,in Las Vegas Nv,awaiting an engine replacement.The vehicles engine light had come on for the 3rd time in apx 4 weeks .The first 2 times I brought the vehicle in the technician told me I probably did not tighten the gas cap and he turned off the engine light and sent me in my way.The only difference the 2nd time the engine light came on was the technician told me if this keeps happening (meaning not tightening my gas cap and causing the engine light to come on)I would need to schedule an appointment.This last time,the 3rd time,I got in the car to pick up my granddaughter and when I started the car it sounded like a bunch of nuts and bolts in a blender. I knew the problem was not anything to do with a gas cap and I had a friend follow behind me and drove very slowly to the dealership repair.I was told the car needed a new engine but the repair and a rent a car had to be authorized.I could not be without a car as I drive my granddaughter to school everyday and this week had band concerts,picnics and graduation events for 8 th grade.I was forced to rent a car in my own however there were no cars available and I spent a day having my friend drive me around trying to find one. The next day I was lucky enough to get a car when someone canceled a reservation.On May 21st,a week later the Kia dealership called and told me that I needed to call the corporate office and speak with them.I called corporate and they asked for my Vin because they wanted to see if I was part of a lawsuit.I had no idea what they were talking about. Then they told me they would fix my car and give me a rental but my car wouldn’t be finished for 3-6 weeks because the parts would be coming from many different places.I also asked the corporate office if they would reimburse me the $600- I had to pay for the rent a car .I was told to contact the dealership as they handled that.So,I contacted the dealership.More information but no space,
THREE OPEN RECALLS THAT PREVENT THE CAR FROM BEING SAFELY DRIVEN, BUT MY LOCAL DEALER SAYS THE SOONEST OPENING THEY HAVE IS IN 2.5 MONTHS TO PERFORM THE WORK
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 KIA SOUL. THE CONTACT STATED WHILE DRIVING AT VARIOUS SPEEDS, THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO IDLE AND SHE HEARD AN ABNORMAL NOISE. THE CONTACT STATED NO WARNING LIGHT WAS ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE LOCAL DEALER DEMONTROND KIA (14101 NORTH FWY, HOUSTON, TEXAS 77090, (281) 801-6254) HOWEVER, THE MECHANIC WAS UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE FAILURE. THE CONTACT STATED SHE CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE THE FAILURE.

THE MANUFACTURER HAD BEEN INFORMED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS UNKNOWN.
PROBLEM  WITH THE ENGINE LIGHT COME ON. THEY TELL ME NOTHING IS WRONG WITH THE ENGINE LIGHT. ALSO I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH  LOOSING OIL I DO NOT HAVE AN OIL LEAK. NO OIL NO WHERE. KIA SERVICE BEEN DOING A OIL TEST EVERY 2000 MILES THEY HAVE TO ADD OIL EVERY TIME. ONE DAY I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY THE OIL LIGHT CAME ON I STOPPED TO CHECK MY OIL LEVEL THE ENGINE WAS DRY WITH NO OIL. I HAD 600 MILE BEFORE A OIL CHANGE.
ENGINE WARNING LIGHT KEEPS COMING ON CAUSED BY ENGINE CODE P050A TOLD BY AUTO SHOP WHERE PURCHASED AND KIA MOTORS THAT THERE IS NO FIX AT THIS TIME  VEHICLE HAS BEEN TO SHOP MULTIPLE TIMES FOR THIS ISSUE PROBLEM STARTED AT APPROX. 32000 MILES CURRENT MILES 33067 DEALER SAID OK TO DRIVE BUT WONT PUT IN WRITING BESIDES ALLINFO I COULD OBTAIN SAID THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE TREATED AS SERIOUS.ONGOING PROBLEM FOR 6 MOS NOW .KIA REP INFORMED ME KIA HAS BEEN AWARE OF PROBLEM SINCE APRIL 2019 AS OF YET NOFIX WHICH LEAVES ME WITH AN UNFIXABLE AND UNDRIVABLE VEHICLE.NOT A HAPPY CAMPER OLDER VEHICLES APPEAR TO HAVE HAD SAME PROBLEM
ON NOV 3RD 2020 I WAS WAITING TO MAKE A LEFT TURN ACROSS A ROAD WITH TWO WAY TRAFFIC. I ACCELERATED THROUGH THE TURN IN ORDER TO GET IN FRONT OF ANY ONCOMING VEHICLES. AS SOON AS I DID THIS I NOTICED MY CAR HAD TROUBLE GAINING SPEED AND FELT OFF. I CONTINUED TO DRIVE AND REALIZED I COULD NOT ACCELERATE PROPERLY AND MY ENGINE WAS MAKING A TERRIBLE KNOCKING NOISE. I DROVE TO WORK AND HOPED IF I LET IT SIT DURING MY SHIFT MAYBE IT WOULD BE BETTER IN THE MORNING (I WORK OVERNIGHT SO THIS HAPPENED IN THE EVENING). AFTER WORK MY CAR WAS STILL MAKING THE SAME NOISE SO I TOOK IT TO MEINEKE WHERE I NORMALLY GET MY OIL CHANGED. THEY DID THE DIAGNOSTIC AND CALLED TO TELL ME I BARELY HAD ANY OIL AND I NEEDED A NEW ENGINE. AT FIRST THEY TRIED TO TELL ME IF WAS MY DOING BUT AFTER SOME RESEARCH I HAVE COME ACROSS THIS THREAD WHERE ALMOST EVERYONE IS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM I DO HAVE THE 2.0L ENGINE ON MY 2015 KIA SOUL THAT I PURCHASED IN 2016. CURRENTLY I AM AT AROUND 88,000 MILES WHICH SEEMS TO BE A COMMON THEME. UNFORTUNATELY AFTER TAKING IT TO KIA I WAS INFORMED THEY WOULD NOT COVER IT EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD EXTENDED THE WARRANTY FOR SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THIS ISSUE. THIS IS BECAUSE SOMEONE LEASED THE VEHICLE BEFORE I PURCHASED IT AND SO I AM CONSIDERED THE SECOND OWNER AND I DO NOT GET THE SAME WARRANTY. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A MEANS TO FIX MY VEHICLE. I DID BUY OTHER COVERAGE WHEN MY VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED THAT MAY HELP BUT IF NOT I AM STUCK FOOTING OVER $5,000 IN REPAIRS.
WAS 2 MILES FROM HOME WHEN OIL LIGHT BLINKED A COUPLE OF TIMES. IT QUIT BLINKING BUT ENGINE STARTED SOUNDING LIKE LIFTERS KNOCKING. MADE IT HOME THAT WAY. NEXT MORNING CHANGED OIL THEN TRIED TO CRANK IT. CRANKED AND RAN ABOUT 30 SECONDS; OIL LIGHT BRIGHT THE ENTIRE TIME. TRIED AGAIN SAME THING. REMOVED OIL FILTER NO OIL GETTING TO IT. TALKED TO MECHANICS WHO SAID COULD BE OIL CONTROL VALVE GONE BAD. PULLED BOTH AND THEY WERE PLUGGED WITH METAL SHAVINGS. KNEW THEN BOTH OIL PUMP AND MOTOR WERE BAD. CALLED KIA,WAS TOLD THAT AS I HAD BOUGHT IT SECOND HAND THAT THE 83000 MILES ON IT MADE IT OUT OF WARRANTY. THAT THEY COULD NOT HELP ME.
THE CAR HAD AN ISSUES WITH THE ENGINE AND CONVERTER ...THEY FIXED THE CONVERTER AND NEVER FIXED THE ISSUES WITH THE ENGINE THAT CAUSED THE CONVERTER TO BECOME CLOG ....WHEN I TOOK IT INTO THE DEALER SERVICE CENTER I TOLD THEM WHAT THE ISSUES WAS AND THEY NEVER LOOKED INTO THE ENGINE, TWO WEEKS AFTER I GOT MY CAR BACK THE ENGINE NOW HAS A HOLE IN THE BLOCK BECAUSE THE NEVER FIXED THE ISSUES THAT CAUSED THE CONVERTER TO BE BLOCKED ...THIS IS RIDICULOUS, AND I DONT HAVE ALL THIS MONEY THEY WANT TO FIX A CAR THAT WAS BROKEN FROM THE BEGINNING AND THE ISSUES STARTED WAY BEFORE MY WARRANTY ENDED!!
I PURCHASED MY 2015 KIA SOUL USED IN JUNE 2017. WHILE DRIVING STRAIGHT IN LOW TRAFFIC TO WORK ON A FREEWAY IN MAY 2020, I FELT MY KIA SOUL BEGIN TO BOG DOWN, THEN THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. NEXT, I HEARD A KNOCKING SOUND. I STOPPED AND CHECKED THE OIL AND SAW IT WAS LOW, DESPITE A FULL OIL CHANGE IN MARCH 2020. I FILLED IT WITH OIL AND I WAS ABLE TO GET IT TO MY MECHANIC THE NEXT DAY. AT THE MECHANICS, I WAS TOLD HE WAS ONLY ABLE TO FIND LESS THAN 1 QUART OF OIL DESPITE ME ADDING 3 QUARTS. HE SAID THE ENGINE WAS DAMAGED AND WOULD NEED TO BE FULLY REPLACED.

IT HAS 78,000 MILES ON IT AND NO LONGER RUNS. ALL MAINTENANCE WAS KEPT UP ON THIS CAR, THIS WAS NOT DUE TO MY NEGLECT AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT DID NOT COME ON. A CAR I CAN'T AFFORD TO FIX AND STILL PAY FOR.
VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED BRAND NEW IN JULY OF 2015 AND HAD APPROXIMATELY 124,000 MILES. ALL REGULAR MAINTENANCE INCLUDING OIL CHANGES WERE DONE AT KIA SERVICE CENTERS , NEXT SERVICE WASN'T DUE FOR ANOTHER 2,000-3,000 MILES.     ENGINE BEGAN MAKING LOUD TICKING AND KNOCKING NOISES ON 25 JAN 2020 AND STARTED HAVING TROUBLE ACCELERATING AND REACHING HIGHER RPMS. I LEFT IT PARKED OVER THE WEEKEND UNTIL I COULD GET IT LOOKED AT BY MY LOCAL KIA DEALER. WHEN I STARTED IT 2 DAYS LATER FOR THE APPOINTMENT THE OIL LIGHT INSTANTLY CAME ON AND THE ENGINE NOISE WAS MUCH WORSE. CHECKED THE OIL RESERVOIR AND THE DIPSTICK WAS COMPLETELY DRY. THERE WERE NO VISIBLE OIL LEAKS OR ANY INDICATION THAT IT WAS BURNING THROUGH OIL. VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO MY LOCAL KIA SERVICE CENTER AND AFTER INSPECTION DETERMINED THE ENGINE NEEDED REPLACING DUE TO DAMAGED CYLINDERS AND PRESENCE OF METAL SHAVINGS AND DEBRIS. THE DEALERSHIP SAID REPLACEMENT ENGINE IS COVERED UNDER THEIR 20 YEAR/200,000 MILE POWERTRAIN WARRANTY. NO CURRENT ETA ON THE REPAIRS AND I'M CURRENTLY WITHOUT A VEHICLE UNTIL THE WORK ON THE ENGINE IS COMPLETED.

STOPPED TO GET FOOD AND OIL LIGHT BEGAN FLICKERING WHEN WE WERE PARKED, WE CHECKED THE OIL AND IT HAD PLENTY. DRIVING TO THE HIGHWAY THE OIL LIGHT DIDN'T FLICKER. GOT ONTO HIGHWAY AND WE WERE GOING ABOUT 65 MPH THE ENGINE SUDDENLY STARTED MAKING A LOUD BANGING NOISE. A FEW MINUTES AFTER THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND THE OIL LIGHT CAME ON. I SLOWED DOWN TO PULL OFF THE FREEWAY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING. MY HUSBAND ASKED ME WHAT THE CAR WAS DOING, AND I TOLD HIM I DON'T KNOW. HE TOLD ME TO GO TO THE NEXT EXIT TO GET TO A SAFER AREA. I WAS REALLY SCARED, PANICKED AND SHAKING BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. WE LUCKILY WERE ABLE TO GET TO A SAFER AREA; WE PARKED THE CAR AND OPENED THE HOOD AND IT WAS STILL MAKING A LOUD BANGING SOUND IN THE ENGINE. DURING EVERYTHING I WAS ABLE TO PLUG MY CELLPHONE INTO THE USB PORT TO USE THE UVO APP FOR MY VEHICLE. I RECEIVED TWO CODES ON POSSIBLE CONDITION WITH THE ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM. WE CONTACTED KIA FOR TOWING AND TURNED THE CAR OFF. WHEN THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER ARRIVED, HE STARTED THE CAR TO DRIVE IT ONTO THE TOW TRUCK AND IT SOUNDED THE SAME. WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO OUR LOCAL KIA DEALERSHIP IN OAKWOOD, GA. BECAUSE WE KNOW IT SHOULD BE UNDER WARRANTY. WE WERE ASKED TO PROVIDE THEM WITH OIL CHANGE RECEIPTS AND A FEW DAYS LATER WE WERE TOLD WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO OPEN THE ENGINE. IF THERE WAS NO SLUDGE IN THE ENGINE, THEN THEY WOULD PAY TO OPEN THE ENGINE AND REPLACE THE ENGINE. IT HAS NOW BEEN OVER 30 DAYS SINCE WE TOWED IT THERE AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FURTHER. THIS CAR IS A 2015 KIA SOUL 2.0L WITH ONLY 65939 MILES. AFTER, I RESEARCHED THIS ISSUE EXTENSIVELY IT'S VERY CONCERNING, AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY KIA REFUSES TO RECALL OR HANDLE THIS MODEL AND ENGINE. FURTHERMORE, THEIR RESPONSE REGARDING THIS MATTER HAS NOT BEEN A GOOD-FAITH EFFORT NOR A GENUINE APPROACH TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS CONCERNS.
DRIVING ON A CITY STREET AT ABOUT 35 MPH, THE ENGINE BEGAN RAPPING WITH NO OIL LIGHT WARNING.  STOPPED THE CAR, THE OIL LIGHT FINALLY WENT ON,  NO OIL WAS LEAKING, BUT CHECKING THE OIL LEVEL REVEALED THERE WAS NO OIL IN THE ENGINE.  THE ENGINE IS A TOTAL LOSS.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 KIA SOUL. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE SEAT BELT SEIZED AND WAS INOPERABLE.

THE MANUFACTURER WAS INFORMED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 69,000.
WE JUST RECEIVED OUR SOUL BACK FOR THE LATEST KIA RECALL SERVICE AFTER BEING 1 WEEK AT THE DEALERSHIP, WHILE DRIVING THE CAR ENGINE SHUT OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TRAFFIC ALMOST CAUSING ACCIDENT AND INJURY. CALLED DEALERSHIP RICK CASE KIA (SUNRISE FL) THEY ASKED US TO TOW THE CAR IN FOR DIAGNOSTIC. RECEIVED A CALL FROM DEALERSHIP STATING ITS A BAD BATTERY CELL THAT CAUSED THE ISSUE, HAD TO SPEND $150 TO GET THE BATTERY REPLACED AS PER RECOMMENDATION.  AFTER RECEIVING THE CAR BACK YESTERDAY AFTERNOON, THE SAME THING HAPPENED IN THE NIGHT THE ENGINE JUST SHUT OFF WHILE DRIVING WE HAD OUR GRAND KIDS IN THE CAR GOING TO PICKUP OUR DAUGHTER FROM WORK. THIS TIME IT WAS A VERY CLOSE CALL NEARLY GOT HIT. CALLED THE DEALERSHIP THERE RESPONSE WAS GET IT TOWED IN AGAIN AND WE WILL TAKE A LOOK. THEY MENTIONED THE ISSUE IS GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH RECENT RECALL, BUT THE ISSUES HAVE STARTED POST RECALL FIX.  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN AS I WORK FOR FLORIDA DEPARTMENT FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES AND AS JOB REQUIREMENT HAVE TO DRIVE FOSTER KIDS AROUND, MAJORITY HIGHWAY DRIVING SOMETHING LIKE THIS ON HIGHWAY WOULD DEFINITELY CAUSE AN ISSUE. CAR BRAND NEW BATTERY IS SHOWING AS DRAINED AGAIN AND DEALERSHIP IS JUST JERKING US AROUND INSTEAD OF TAKING FULL RESPONSIBILITY AND FIXING THE CAR.
ONE DAY I HEARD A RATTLING NOISE WHILE DRIVING. THE NEXT DAY, THE NOISE TURNED INTO A VERY LOUD TICKING/KNOCKING SOUND. I KEEP MY OIL CHANGED EVERY 3000 MILES SO IT COULD NOT BE THAT THERE WAS NOT ANY OIL IN THE VEHICLE. I HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP AS I WAS AFRAID TO DRIVE IT BECAUSE I HAD HEARD THAT THE CARS WERE CATCHING ON FIRE. I INQUIRED ABOUT THIS AND WAS TOLD THERE WERE NOT ANY OPEN RECALLS ON ENGINE DAMAGE WITH KIA SOULS AND A DIAGNOSTIC WOULD BE PERFORMED. A FEW DAYS LATER I WAS INFORMED THAT THE ENGINE WAS GONE AND ADVISED $6800 TO REPAIR. THE FUNNY THING IS I HAVE BEEN ASKED REPEATEDLY, HOW WOULD THE ENGINE GO OUT IN A 4 YEAR OLD CAR? I WAS ALSO ADVISED THAT THERE WAS NO WARRANTY REMAINING ON THE CAR FROM THE MANUFACTURER AS I WAS THE SECOND OWNER OF THE VEHICLE AND THE WARRANTY ENDED AT 60,000 MILES. IRONICALLY, MY ENGINE FAILED AT 68,729. NOW, I'M STUCK WITH A CAR THAT DOESN'T RUN AND OWE ALMOST $10000 ON IT. I AM BEYOND HEATED WITH ANGER. I CAN'T TRADE IT DUE TO THE NEGATIVE EQUITY AND IT COSTS MORE TO REPAIR IT THAN WHAT THE CAR IS ACTUALLY VALUED AT.
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO THE CAR SAID WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE ENGINE AND WITH THE COOLING SYSTEM KIA HAD CHECK IT OUT AND SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG BUT IT KEEPS GOING ON IT HAS A GAS SMELL LOW PUSH TO DO 70 ON HIGHWAY WON'T LET ME PUT ON CRUISE CONTROL FOR LONG I CAN FEEL CAR READY TO SHAKE AND STOP NEEDS OIL ALL THE TIME WHEN I DRIVE FOR 1 HR TO WORK CAR STARTS TO SHAKE AT A RED LIGHT AFTER I'M ALMOST AT WORK I CHANGED BATTERY ON 3/10/19 I ALSO CHANGED THE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS ALSO BRAKES ALWAYS HAVE TO CHANGE BEFORE THERE DO  ON 3/15/19 HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TO CHANGE THE FLEX ON THE CAR ALSO BECAUSE THE OIL WAS LEAKING ON THE ENGINE IT NEEDED A SEAL AND THE TOP PART I FORGOT WHAT IT'S CALLED REPLACED THAT'S ALL I NOW FOR NOW
ENGINE IDLES MORE ROUGH THEN WHEN WE FIRST BOUGHT IT, OUR KIA SOUL DOES NOW HAVE 30,000 MILES BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO IDLE DIFFERENTLY WHEN WE FIRST START IT IN THE MORNING WHEN IT IS COLD THE WAY IT STARTS THOUGH AND IS IDLING MAKES THE CAR SHAKE IN AWAY THAT IT DIDN'T WHEN WE FIRST GOT IT
OUR 2015 KIA SOUL EV HAS OVER HEATED THE MAIN CONTROLLER AND SHUT DOWN IN TRAFFIC AND WOULD NOT MOVE. THIS HAPPENED TWICE IN CHANDLER (PHOENIX ) ARIZONA AFTER TRAVELING JUST 10 MILES.  THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN.    THE CAR CANNOT HANDLE THE HEAT IN ARIZONA, GEORGIA OR OTHER HOT SOUTHERN STATES. THE BATTERIES AND BMS ALSO FAIL AFTER 2-3 YEARS.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 KIA SOUL. WHILE DRIVING VARIOUS SPEEDS, THE TRANSMISSION LUNGED WITHOUT WARNING. IN ADDITION, THE CONTACT OBSERVED THAT THE VEHICLE SHOOK VIGOROUSLY WHILE IDLING OR WHILE DRIVING. ALSO, THE VEHICLE WOULD SOMETIMES FAIL TO SWITCH GEARS. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO A DEALER WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE ENGINE MOUNT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED, BUT THE FAILURE RECURRED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER AGAIN WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE FUEL INJECTORS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 14,000.
I WAS COMING OUT OF A RED LIGHT INTERSECTION AND WHEN I TRIED TURNING TO THE LEFT THE CAR WOULD NOT TURN AND KEPT GOING STRAIGHT.  IT TURNED MINIMALLY AND HIT THE CURB SCRATCHING THE 2 PASSENGER SIDE WHEELS (FRONT AND BACK).  NO AIRBAGS WERE DEPLOYED AS I WAS ONLY AT MAYBE 20-30MPH.  AS THE CAR ALIGNED WITH THE ROAD AGAIN I NOTICE THE STEERING IS 90% IMPAIRED.  I STILL MANAGE TO DRIVE HOME AS THERE WERE VERY FEW CARS ON THE ROAD BUT THE CAR WOULD RANDOMLY SOMETIMES, VERY STRONGLY VEER TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT, MAKING IT EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.  I REMEMBER THERE WAS A RECALL LETTER I HAD RECEIVED AND WHEN I GOT HOME I CHECKED IT OUT AND IT DESCRIBED EXACTLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO ME: "THE PINION PLUG WHICH SECURES THE PINION GEAR TO THE STEERING GEAR ASSEMBLY MAY LOOSEN DUE TO THE USE OF ADHESIVE WITH INSUFFICIENT BONDING STRENGTH DURING ASSEMBLY.  IF THE PLUG LOOSENS SUFFICIENTLY, THE PINION GEAR MAY SEPARATE FROM THE STEERING GEAR ASSEMBLY WHICH COULD CAUSE LOSS OF STEERING AND RESULT IN A CRASH.".  I THINK IN MY CASE THIS PINION CAME COMPLETELY LOOSE AND THAT CAUSED THE CRASH.  THE CAR WAS JUST TOWED TO A KIA DEALERSHIP BUT NOW THEY WILL INSPECT AND DECIDE IF THAT WAS THE CASE OR NOT.  WHAT IF THEY SIMPLY DECIDE THEY WILL SAY THIS WAS CAUSED TO SOMETHING ELSE AND NOT THE RECALL ISSUE?

PAINT PEELING EXTENSIVELY TOP, HOOD, SIDES. PRIMER SHOWING IN THOSE SPOTS AND RUST BEGINNING TO SHOW
My kia has always used a lot of oil to the point I need to top it off regularly despite getting recommended oil changes and doing recommended maintenance. Recently My engine started misfiring so I replaced all spark plugs and ignition coils, but was still having issues. Found out today that catalytic converter is main issue and needs to be replaced. Dealer is requiring I bring in to determine if a warranty will cover. Never had a check engine light but very slow acceleration that created several dangerous situations for me on the road. My professional mechanic repaired other issues/diagnosed this problem.
The vehicle stalled due to lack of oil.(Before the 6 month oil change was due.)Yes it is available for inspection upon request. No one’s safety was put at risk. When the problem was brought up to the Kia dealership We were told that they had called in November 2023 And since we did not respond we voided our opportunity to have the engine Covered under the recall warranty. We did not receive a call. The vehicle has only been inspected by mechanic no work has been done on it. No lights came on to indicate there was a problem, it happened suddenly.

Please investigate Kia motors. Thank you.
INCIDENT: [XXX] Driving from [XXX] to [XXX]   Notice a slight gasoline smell in the car. I figured it was traffic smog.  [XXX]   I noticed the inside of the car still smelled of gasoline. Looked up on Google to see if this was an underlying issue. My quick search led me to believe that it was severe.   Firestone Complete Auto Care [XXX]:  After a quick lookup on Google, I called my local Firestone via Bluetooth to see if they had an opening today. When I talked to a worker describing my concerns, they told me there were no openings that day and that tomorrow ([XXX]) they were available. I booked an appt for [XXX] at 10 a.m. When I finished talking to FireStone, I was driving through [XXX] .   Driving through [XXX]  to get back home ([XXX]): I stopped at a light that intersects between [XXX]  and [XXX]. I noticed that the hood had smoke coming out and saw flames.

We have a p0420 code with check engine light on (catalyst below threshold) with unusual oil consumption. We have been refused a replacement of the catalytic converter which is failing and may or may not have caused severe engine damage. Engine is going through an unusual high amount of oil with no oil leaks. Contacted Kia NA on July 21st and was told the cat was not covered even though it's failing and we have recall notices coming in the mail.
The contact owns a 2016 Kia Soul. The contact stated that while driving at an undisclosed speed, the check engine warning light illuminated. The contact stated that the vehicle was previously repaired under NHTSA Campaign Number: 19V120000 (Engine, Engine and Engine Cooling). The vehicle was taken to the dealer, where it was diagnosed that the catalytic convertor needed to be replaced; however, the dealer declined the repair due to the mileage exceeding 80,000 miles. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure and a case was opened. The failure mileage was approximately 89,000.
Previous NHTSA 11498487 for the same issue reported on 12/22. After 8 months of changing the catalytic converter the Kia Soul 2016 de-accelerated in the highway from 60mph to barely 30Mph with a burning smell the check engine light come up and the code once again for the catalytic converter. The catalytic converter was replaced under the warranty from the repair shop on 1/23. Now on 4/23 the check engine light is on again for the catalytic converter again. The repair shop won't change it again. Instead they suggested to bring it to the dealership. Kia dealership stated that my VIN is not included in the recall and they only did theE PI2002A ECU update the rest is not covered by the manufacturer warranty. I've changed 3 times the catalytic converter and the light is code is asking for another one. It's not normal. Major safety hazard for the vehicle to stall in the highway suddenly. Proper maintenance and oil changes are done on time as suggested by Kia. However it burns oil after a new change before hitting the 3,000 miles driven short distances and engine is less than a quart with no leeks at all. Another safety hazard  because there's no warning light of low engine oil that could possibly cause the engine to stop and hazard to driver and others.

The vehicle just shuts off while driving.  I managed to get the car back home and no warning lights were on but the oil was bear with no signs of leaking and just completed an oil change less than 6 months prior.  Once we filled up the oil, it had a clicking noise that sounds like a lifter problem.  After diagnosis, it was found that cylinders #3 and 4 were rotting due to poor lubrication and required a full engine replacement.  We opted to decline the repairs as it costs more than the value of the vehicle.

My car suddenly caught fire.  I am assuming it was the engine because the fire started under the hood of the car. I never received any information regarding a recall or a safety issue but when the Vin was checked by my insurance inspector the recall came up.
2/1/22 Vehicle was taken in for a power issue or transmission issue. Manahawkin Kia, NJ service department determined it to be a Catalytic Convertor clog. with a  estimated $2,230 to replace. Dealership allegedly did 360 service check. The vehicle was taken home for second opinions. Other certified independent mechanics agreed that the CAT was clogged, but recommended  a compression leak down check since there was no motor oil in the engine. It is important to note that the KIA service claim to have done a 360 check.  However, there was no engine oil in the motor.   Further, ever since  KIA did the SC#176 RECALL the motor has burned oil somehow. WE believe that KIA is at fault and the SC#176 RECALL damaged the vehicle without doubt. KIA of America should be held accountable for our loss as well as anyone who has similar issues with the KIA motor.

On Monday September 6, 2021 at about 11:30 pm, I was driving home east on interstate 90, just east of Roselle rd. near Schaumburg, Illinois. When the car began to violently shake.  The dash board lights began to flash and the engine just stopped. We managed to steer the car to the side of the express way, in an attempt to restart the car with no luck.  A Illinois Dept. of Transportation road side assistance driver tried to start the car when the car explored into fire, the driver put the fire out and provided us with the number of a toe truck , which we had the car toed to the Schaumburg Kia Dealer, located at 1100 East Golf Road, Schaumburg, IL 60173, phone No. is (847) 908-0502, where the dealer is trying to determine the cause of the fire and the amount of damage, if the car is a total loss or not.  My car is a 2016 Kia Soul.  At this point I have not heard from the dealer after a week, I have called the dealer several times with no reply at all.
The contact owns a 2016 Kia Soul. The contact stated while driving at various speeds, the vehicle would not accelerate when the accelerator pedal was depressed. The contact also stated that due to the transmission failure, the vehicle would not allow the contact to shift gears. The contact stated no warning light was illuminated. The vehicle was taken to a local dealer where it was diagnosed with some loose wiring needing to be repaired. The vehicle was repaired however, the failure recurred. The contact then took the vehicle back to the dealer where it was diagnosed with the transmission needing to be replaced. The vehicle was repaired but the failure recurred. The contact then took the vehicle back to the dealer for the third time where it was diagnosed with the catalytic converter needing to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The contact was relating the failure to NHTSA campaign number: 19V120000 (Engine, Engine and Engine cooling). The manufacturer had been informed of the failure and informed the contact that they would contact the dealer. The failure mileage was approximately 77,000.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2016 KIA SOUL. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING, A LOUD NOISE WAS PRESENT COMING FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT WITH THE CHECK ENGINE WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO BOOMER KIA LOCATED AT 339 W INTERSTATE 240 SERVICE RD, OKLAHOMA CITY, OK 73139 WHO DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS NO OIL IN THE ENGINE. THE CONTACT INDICATED THAT THE OIL WAS RECENTLY CHANGED PRIOR TO THE FAILURE. THE DEALER ADDED OIL TO THE ENGINE HOWEVER, DAYS LATER THE VEHICLE STALLED AND IT WAS DISCOVERED AGAIN THAT THERE WAS NO OIL IN THE ENGINE. THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS NOT DETERMINED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT YET NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 71,000. THE VIN WAS NOT AVAILABLE.
MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING THE CAR AND HAD JUST PULLED ONTO THE INTERSTATE AND HE HEARD A "POP" SOUND, SO HE PULLED OVER TO CHECK IT OUT. WHEN HE GOT OUT AND OPENED THE HOOD THE ENGINE WAS ON FIRE AND ENGULFED THE WHOLE CAR. THERE WAS NO WARNING ANYTHING WAS WRONG PRIOR TO HIM HEARING THE SOUND. IT NEVER LOST POWER, NEVER HAD ANY SMOKE COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD, NEVER A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, OVER HEATING LIGHT, LOW OIL PRESSURE LIGHT, NOTHING. IT WAS RUNNING 100% FINE. THE CAR IS A TOTAL LOSS, AND I AM JUST THANKFUL HE STOPPED AND GOT OUT AND IS SAFE AND DID NOT HAVE OUR CHILDREN IN THE CAR WITH HIM AT THE TIME THIS OCCURED.
WAS DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY WHEN MY VEHICLE BEGAN RATTLING AND STOPPED RUNNING. PULLED OFF THE HIGHWAY TO ASSESS THE ISSUE AND IT SEEMED AS IF THERE WAS NO OIL IN THE CAR. I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE A MONTH AND A HALF PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT AND THE ENGINE OIL WAS FINE AS WELL AS THERE WAS STILL 2,000 MILES TO GO BEFORE THE NEXT OIL CHANGE. UPON DOING SOME RESEARCH TO SEE IF THERE WAS A RECALL, IT SEEMS THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON 2016 KIA SOULS FOR THE 1.6L ENGINE VERSION OF MY VEHICLE. I HAVE THE 2.0L ENGINE. MORE INVESTIGATION SHOWS THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE ACROSS THE BOARD WITH BOTH VERSIONS OF THE 2016 KIA SOUL, BUT THE 2.0L VERSION HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED.     THE KIA RECALL I AM REFERRING TO IS: 19V120000 IN WHICH "HIGH EXHAUST GAS TEMPERATURES MAY DAMAGE THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER, POSSIBLY RESULTING IN ABNORMAL ENGINE COMBUSTION AND DAMAGE TO ONE OR MORE OF THE ENGINE'S PISTONS AND POSSIBLE PISTON CONNECTING ROD FAILURE. PISTON DAMAGE MAY RESULT IN AN ENGINE STALL, INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH. A BROKEN CONNECTING ROD MAY PUNCTURE THE ENGINE BLOCK ALLOWING ENGINE OIL TO ESCAPE. THE LEAKING OIL MAY CONTACT THE EXHAUST, INCREASING THE RISK OF A FIRE."    I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE SAME ISSUE THAT MY VEHICLE EXPERIENCED.
AUGUST 28, 2020 I RECIEVED A LETTER FROM KIA CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS STATING A RECALL ON A 2014 - 2016 KIA SOUL CONDUCTING SOFTWARE UPDATE ON ENGINE TO PROTECT THE ENGINE. GOT THAT COMPLETED AND SEVERAL WEEKS LATER WENT BACK TO THE KIA DEALERSHIP FOR AN OIL CHANGE, WAS ASKED DID I GIVE A GOOD REVIEW FOR KIA AND THE GUY APPEARED UPSSET, ANYWHO AFTER THAT OIL CHANGE MY KIA STARTED TO RUN SLOW AND WOULD NOT ACCERATE TO THE NORMAL SPEED OR SEEMS TO STOP. ASK A MECHANIC AND SAID IT SOUNDS LIKKE THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER. I LOOK UP INFORMATION ON KIA AND THERE IS A RECALL FOR CATALYTIC CONVERTER, HOWEVER, THE DEALERSHIP IS CHECKING FOR OTHER THINGS. HOW DO I PROTECT MY CAR?

Car stalls when at a stop. Restart ignition stalls again when placed into drive and accelerator is pressed. Restart, brake pedal and accelerator pressed at same time, while put into gear, and then it will move. The oil light and battery light comes on when it stalls.
I was driving down a freeway after changing my oil when my car began backfiring, which was strange so I pulled over and checked my engine but I saw nothing wrong, so I went back to driving so I could get home, but as I was driving home, the engine made a loud clang and then the engine completely died. I had come to find out later after paying to have my car towed home that it had infact overheated, and blown a piston straight through the engine block.
Car burns through oil like no other. I won’t even be half way through my 3000 miles and with no warning the car will be low on oil and stalling in the middle of Turning. Usually when turning left. Mechanic says there isn’t an issue. But no car should be made to burn oil excessively. I can’t even make it the regular 3000 miles. Engine light has come on multiple times. Now replorting catalytic converter issue assuming that’s related to the excessive rate of oil burning.
The contact owns a 2017 Kia Soul. The contact stated that while her friend was driving at an undisclosed speed, he heard an abnormal sound inside the vehicle then the vehicle started to decelerate without warning. The contact then stated that other drivers on the road alerted the contact’s friend that a fire had ignited underneath the vehicle. No warning lights were illuminated. The contact’s friend was able to pull the vehicle off the road and exit the vehicle. The local authorities were notified and extinguished the fire. No injuries were sustained. No medical attention was required. A police report was filed. The vehicle was towed to a collision lot where the technician diagnosed the vehicle that the engine failed and needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The dealer was notified of the failure and the contact was informed of the NHTSA Campaign Number: 22V031000 (Air Bags). The manufacturer was notified of the failure and the contact was informed that the VIN was not included in a recall. The failure mileage was approximately 130,000.
I was driving down the interstate and my car made a loud noise, so I pulled over.  Smoke started pouring out then it was immediately in flames. No prior issues. No injuries as I was able to get out. If fire recalls were till 2015, clearly my vehicle had issues too. What do I do?
We were driving down the highway and the engine started making sounds like something was breaking. I pulled over and then couldn’t start it again. We had to have it towed to the dealership where we were told we needed a new engine without them explaining what happened or why. There were no symptoms of failure prior to the failure itself. Engine failure while driving down the interstate is dangerous and we are lucky nothing bad happened to us.
Kia started knocking loudly and then seized while driving turnpike.  Car had to be pushed off road.  Unable to restart.  It had blown a rod.  Oil was dry but had not appeared to be leaking prior and no warning lights were on before failure.  Now needs new engine but is not in any current recalls thought the engine seems to have been recalled in other models.
On Tuesday July 27 2021, we noticed that the oil light was flickering at idle on our 2017 Kia Soul. We called a dealership and they recommended that we have the car towed to their service department. We received confirmation that the car arrived at the dealership at 1.32 pm on Tuesday July 27 2021.   We’d like to note that our 2017 Kia Soul had approximately 20,000 miles on it at this time.  The dealership ran diagnostics on car and found nothing wrong. They also drove the car and said that they saw no indication of a problem (no flickering oil light). They said that the oil looked dark and thin. We had checked the oil the day before and it looked yellow to gold in color. We were not shown any evidence that the oil was dark, only the word of the service department. We had the car serviced and then picked it up from the dealership.   10 minutes or so after picking the car up from the dealership, on Colorado Highway 58 heading west, just outside Golden, CO, there was a loud knocking noise and the check engine and oil pressure lights starting blinking. Seconds later, the car lost power, and then stalled. My husband was able to steer it to side of the highway, where we waited more than three hours for roadside assistance from Kia before having to leave the car to get somewhere safe. The outside temperatures were 90 degrees of more and our child, who was with us, is very sensitive to high temperatures.  We are waiting to hear from the dealership (Kia towing somehow managed to cancel the tow order and left the car on the side of the road all night) and do not yet know the exact nature of the engine failure but the car is undriveable. The fact that the engine stalled and died on the highway, traveling at a speed of 55 mph, is incredibly dangerous and put my husband at extreme risk for an accident or the infamous Kia engine fire. All of this happened just minutes after picking up a car that we were told had no issues.
FIRST DRIVE IN THE MORNINGS, THERE IS A STRONG ODD ODOR  COMING THROUGH THE AIR VENTS.
I STOPPED AT A RED LIGHT AND MY CAR CUT OFF. I WOULD NOT CRANK BACK UP. THE. MECHANIC SAID THE TIMING CHAIN BROKE. MY CAR WILL NEED A NEW MOTOR. I HAVE ONLY 80,000 MILES. NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEM AND LOVED MY CAR.

The vehicle has been well maintained. About 1.5 years ago, it experienced a fuel injector failure. All four injectors were replaced to ensure the health of the engine.  Recently, while on an 8-hour trip, halfway through, the engine experienced a sudden loss of power on the highway, nearly resulting in a crash, and the check engine light illuminated. The car was towed to a Kia dealership, where they stated the engine had failed. Cylinders 3 and 4 have ring and valve damage.  The car had been performing well with no issues or warning signs, such as a trouble light or high temperatures. All other diagnostics were rated green by Kia.

We were driving the car along the highway at 70 MPH when the engine started making an odd sound and this went on for about 3 minutes before we found the nearest exit and pulled into a rest stop and as soon as we pulled onto the rest stop exit ramp the engine seized and the car shut down.  The rod bearing failed. It is available for inspection upon request as it is currently sitting in a dealership repair shop waiting for repairs.  Yes, my safety and the safety of others was put at risk. There was absolutely no warning that the engine was about to seize (no safety lights) and if we hadn't pulled over then the engine could have seized while we were going 70 MPH and we could have gotten hit by a truck and caused a horrible accident.  The vehicle has only been inspected by the dealership service shop.  No, there were NO warning lamps, messages, or ANY symptoms before the engine completely seized.
I was driving on Interstate 64.im Norfolk when the car started to smoke, I just made to the side of the road and my car turned off. My dad told me that I he had the same thing happen to him on his 2011 optima his car turned off on the road. Kia had a recall on Kia optima engines.  I spoke to another person that has a sol the same thing happened to them and there car only had 70,000 miles. Kia has put bad dangerous engines in there cars.
During a front end accident the car burst into flames and the driver was trapped and passed away at the scene.

AROUND 11:40PM ON 12/3/2019 I PARKED MY CAR IN AN EMPTY PARKING LOT - CAR WAS STATIONARY. IT WAS 51 DEGREES OUT AND CLOUDY, BUT NO RAIN OR ANY PRECIPITATION. THE CAR WAS NOT RUNNING; THE HEAT/AC WERE NOT ON. NO ONE WAS AROUND. SUDDENLY, THE WINDSHIELD IN THE BACK (LARGE HATCH DOOR WINDOW) SHATTERED ENTIRELY. IT SOUNDED LIKE A SHOT. NOTHING FELL ON THE CAR, NO PEOPLE OR ANIMALS WERE AROUND. THE WHOLE WINDOW WAS SHATTERED AND CRUMBLING ALONG THE EDGES. NO ROCKS, BBS, PELLETS, BRANCHES, BALLS, OR OTHER OBJECTS ANYWHERE. NO OTHER DAMAGE MADE AT THAT MOMENT TO THE CAR AT ALL. THE PANE STAYED TOGETHER UNTIL I OPENED/CLOSED MY DRIVER SIDE DOOR. THEN IT STARTED TO FALL APART. NO EVIDENCE OF FOUL PLAY. ONLY 12,600 MILES ON THE CAR. CHECKED WITH THE POLICE, BUT NO SIMILAR  INCIDENTS HAD BEEN REPORTED. OCCURRED IN KIRKLAND, WA. NO PREVIOUS ACCIDENTS AS FAR AS I KNOW. EXCEPT A FEW WEEKS PRIOR, ON THE HIGHWAY DURING RUSH HOUR, A LON CRACK APPEARED ON THE DRIVERS SIDE OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD, STARTING FROM THE TOP EDGE ABOUT 9" LONG. NO EVIDENCE OF ROCK, DEBRIS, OR IMPACT.

My Kia 2019 soul has been giving me several problems with the engine jerking and the light coming on and then goes off and then come on I had it diagnosed several times even when I first got it and they said it was nothing wrong but I can tell it was something wrong it just like revs up or jerk or have these issues when I drive like it didn't want to pull but I kept asking and asking is something wrong with this car when I purchase it at Clay Cooley in Irving Texas they told me no they checked it out gave me a rental now I just bought that car in May of 2021 and they told me it wasn't nothing wrong the person that had it before me only had it a year and I didn't get no report on it about it but I do think it had some engine issues but they didn't give me no history of it they just say you buy it as is but I kept telling him I did not like the way the car was driving I wanted to replace it they ignored me and my calls I wanted to replace the key now I heard it is 2024 the light is still on and everywhere I went they will change my transmission in 2022 now I just got the car 2021 of me and they were saying the transmission burnt out now how can a transmission burnt out when they supposed to have checked the car when I bought it in 21 I wanted to give up this car and I wanted to replace it they never did do that. Now here it is I'm suffering with oxygen sensor and they said the Cadillac converter which wasn't the Cadillac converter cuz they said this is a new car how can it be the Cadillac converter I told him I think it was the sensor everybody saw on the cold day was not the oxygen sensor now here it is it's very bad where now I'm having issues also they was I had it checked another time where the man said I was using a lot of oil and he said the oil must be leaking and he checking it wasn't now it seems like it's leaking oil because I keep have to use six quarts of oil every 2 to 3 days I'm using oil but I don't like this car never did I ain't had it that long and I
The contact owns a 2019 Kia Soul. The contact stated that the vehicle was consuming an excessive amount of engine oil. Additionally, the seat belt warning light was illuminated.

The failure mileage was approximately 99,000.
The dash had a electrical burn smell then smoke started coming out. There were children in the car. Unsure if the dash was on fire we stopped and started removing the area the smoke was coming from. The knob that controls the fan speed for the heat/ac had burnt and melted the plug the sensor to the knob as well as inside the back of the knob. We immediately unplugged it to prevent further damage or fire. After checking the internet I saw many forums stating the fan would only blow if they fiddle with the knob between setting 3 & 4 which is how mine started. Also on this panel is the plug to the light for the passenger airbag. This is my main source of transportation and a very dangerous situation. I took it back to the dealership where I bought it brand new in 2019 and was informed it’s my problem and my responsibility to pay for this electrical issue. Giving other people are having the same problem I believe it should be looked into before someone’s car catches on fire. This is a manufacturing problem as it’s obviously something I could not have done and too many other complaints. I mentioned to the service man perhaps maybe it should be reported and looked into as a recall issue and was informed there’s no way because he’s never heard of anyone else having this problem or seen this before. I explained perhaps they just haven’t brought theirs in or reported it yet or they simple don’t know that’s the problem and this is the result. This is very dangerous please look into it. I am unsure if there was ever a small fire or it just became so hot it melted and we happened to smell and see the smoke.
I CAN BE STOPED ON THE ROAD WITH THE BREAK PEDAL PUSHED ALL THE WAY AND THE CAR STILL MOVES FORWARD. AT SOME POINTS AT STOP LIGHTS I PUT MY CAR IN PARK SO IT WON'T MOVE FORWARD.  THIS HAS HAPPEN A LOT SINCE I HAVE BOUGHT THE CAR IN OCTOBER OF 2018.
The engine totally failed while driving without any warning. Zero warning lights came on and the car would not restart. I had it towed to the dealership where they reported that I needed a new engine which is not covered under warranty or recall repair even though its been recalled several times and half the people who own 2020 KIAs seem to have almost the same exact problems. The cars start to consume way too much oil and then the engines seem to fail not soon after so I brought the car back home since its over $8000. to replace just the engine! This vehicle is not paid off so its sitting at my house without being repaired or drivable. The dealership where I had it towed, Ray Skillman NE KIA, in Indianapolis charged me $200 for diagnostics yet never explained what was wrong with the car other than it  needs a new engine.
2020 Kia Soul with 55,000 miles on it had the check engine light come on. The car was promptly taken to the dealership where was determined that the combustion chamber had filled with oil which had soaked the spark plugs, causing the pistons to misfire and completely ruin the engine. The car had always been maintained with all maintenance  performed at a dealership with receipts for proof but since the car was a second owner and outside the warranty by 7 months, Kia wouldn’t replace engine despite 187k other Kia souls being recalled for similar issues  because this vehicle wasn’t included in the recall. There is no reason for a car with only 55k Myles that had been properly maintained according to the owners manual to have an engine seals fail and flood it with oil and total the engine
Engine failure while driving, only 51,000 miles on the vehicle. I was driving on the interstate and fortunately was in the right lane so I could pull over immediately and it did not cause an accident. I was driving approximately 45 miles per hour to pull onto the interstate when a loud noise and engine failure occurred.The engine light and oil light came on when I heard the engine stalling. My car was taken to the dealership where they stated the engine needs to be replaced for $8200 and it’s beyond warranty. According to their recall test, it passed the recall. I’m assuming that’s for the piston oil recall, but they have been unable to provide proof or details on how it passed. I have had regular maintenance on my car and should not require a new engine at this point. Please advise.

I bought my car brand new off the lot 0 miles on it. Recieved a letter in mail Dec. 7th 2021 bout the pistons not being treated properly. And the software being available. I've been putting anywhere from 1 quart to 1.5 quart of oil in weekly. There's no leaks no smoke not sure where oil is going. It stalls when stopped  or idling. When in park will stall.  After I get gas it won't start I have to put gas pedal all the way to floor and hope it's turns over and when it finally does I have to keep it idle over 2rpms or it sputters til it stalls. I feel these are continued safety issues. Besides my oil issue gas mileage is awful.
On 5/27/23 I was stopped at a light in the middle of active traffic.  When traffic started moving again, I put my foot on the accelerator.  Nothing happened: the "check engine" light appeared on the dashboard as well as the "Auto Stop" light, which showed up yellow.  The engine was dead.  Cars in back started honking.  I put on my hazard lights, turned the ignition off, waited a few seconds, then on impulse turned the key on again.  Car started without a problem, and the indicator lights disappeared.  I called the dealership but could not get a service appointment until Thursday.  I am afraid my own car will kill me if this happens again in active traffic.

The contact owns a 2020 Kia Soul. The contact stated while she was at the stop light, the light turned green, the accelerator pedal was depressed however, the vehicle hesitated to respond. The vehicle failed to exceed 2 mph while driving. There were no warning lights illuminated. The contact stated she depressed the accelerator pedal with force and the vehicle accelerated, and she was able to drive to her destination. The vehicle was not diagnosed nor repaired. The contact stated that the failure reoccurred while driving. The contact received a notification for NHTSA Campaign Number: 21V259000 (Engine) however, the dealer informed the contact that they would be able to inspect the vehicle in approximately two months. The contact stated that the manufacturer had exceeded a reasonable amount of time for the recall repair. The manufacturer was notified of the failure but did not provide any assistance. The approximate failure mileage was 10,000. Parts distribution disconnect.
Purchased car on 7/16/19 with 13 miles.  On 1/26/20 the car had 6,764 miles when the car started to appear as though it was in neutral while driving down the highway at 70 miles per hour.  Even when giving it gas the RPM would increase and engine sounded revved up but transmission was not working.  Then it would sporadically kick in enough that I put my 4 ways on, got off the interstate (81) and limped that car home because the car would not go more that 20 MPH once it came to a full stop, it couldn't even make it up the very small grade to get onto my driveway.  Called KIA roadside and it was towed to the dealer, Fred Beans Mechanicsburg PA.  Told it needed a new transmission, got car back a month later 2/25/20.  On 4/19/21, car has 14,953 miles and the same exact thing happens, I'm on Interstate 83 and the car starts lunging, going in and out of neutral.  Once at a full stop car would limp along till reaching a total MPH of 20.  Car was towed to Fred Beans KIA, Mechanicsburg PA and yes the transmission again.  Dealer said transmission was replaced , this time it took 2 weeks, got the car back on 5/1/21.  I asked why does this keep happening and the dealership refused to provide any information, shrugged their shoulders.  The attendant at the service counter just kept saying I just work here and don't know anything about the cars!  Very scary situation, I or anyone driving with this problem could cause a terrible accident and even a fatal accident.  The first time this happened could have been manufacture defect but the second time creates a question as to the potential harm this vehicle can cause to all drivers.    No explanation and no trust in this car's dependability. I am not able to financially unload this car at this time.  Worst car I have ever purchased and I have purchased many brand new cars but first and last time for KIA.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNED A 2020 KIA SOUL. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ILLUMINATED. THE CONTACT TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER (LIFETIME KIA  4170 US-64, MURPHY, NC 28906;(828) 835-9200) WHO DIAGNOSED THAT THE CRANKSHAFT HAD FAILED HOWEVER NO REPAIR WAS COMPLETED. THE CONTACT STATED THAT SHORTLY AFTER THAT WHILE THEIR SON WAS DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 35 MPH, WHEN THEY HEARD A POP NOISE COMING FROM THE FRONT END OF THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE THEN LOSS ALL POWER AND A NEARBY DRIVER INFORMED THE CONTACT THAT THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE WAS ON FIRE. THE DRIVER COASTED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND EXITED THE VEHICLE. THE FIRE THEN BEGAN TO GROW FAIRLY QUICKLY. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PUT OUT THE FIRE AND A REPORT WAS MADE. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED AND DEEMED TOTALED. THERE WERE NO INJURIES AND NO MEDICAL ATTENTION WAS NEEDED. THE CONTACT HAD SPOKEN TO THE DEALER REGARDING THE FIRE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 71,000. *DT
OUR KIA SOUL 2020 HAS SOME FAILURE RELATED TO THE AUTO STOP FEATURE (ISG). STARTING AT ABOUT 3000 MILES, THE CAR GROANS AS IT COMES OUT OF AUTO STOP, WITH THE NOISE COMING FROM THE FRONT LEFT.   KIA CORPORATE DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS AS A REPEATED ISSUE, THOUGH THERE ARE MANY FORUMS ONLINE RECORDING THIS EXACT PROBLEM AROUND THIS MILEAGE. THERE SEEMS TO BE NO CONSENSUS ON THE REPAIR, AND NO CONSENSUS ON WHETHER IT IS SAFE TO DRIVE.  IF THE AUTO STOP (ISG) FEATURE IS DISABLED, THE NOISE DOES NOT HAPPEN.     MORE ACCOUNTS CAN BE FOUND HERE: HTTPS://WWW.KIASOULFORUMS.COM/THREADS/ENGINE-GRINDS-WHEN-COMING-OUT-OF-THE-AUTO-START-STOP.116042/    A VIDEO WITH THE SAME NOISE CAN BE FOUND HERE: HTTPS://YOUTU.BE/1TA6BH6ZPU8    THIS UNNERVING NOISE OCCURS AFTER ABOUT 10 MINUTES OF DRIVING (NO NOISE PRIOR TO THAT).
I JUST PURCHASED A 2020 KIA SOUL IN DECEMBER AND IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE 5,000 MILES ON IT YET. WHEN I WAS DRIVING IN THE CITY AND STOPPED AT A RED LIGHT, THE ENGINE COMPLETELY DIED. I TRIED PUSHING ON THE GAS TO SEE IF IT WOULD GO AND THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE. ALL THE LIGHTS ON THE DASHBOARD WERE FLASHING. I HAD TO IMMEDIATELY PUT MY HAZARD LIGHTS ON, TURN THE CAR OFF, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT STARTED RUNNING AGAIN. IT WAS SUCH A CRAZY EXPERIENCE. IT'S REALLY SAD THAT I PURCHASED A  BRAND NEW CAR AND IT CANNOT EVEN KEEP ME SAFE. KIA NEEDS TO DO A RECALL ON THE ENGINES AND TRANSMISSION. THERE SEEMS TO BE A MAJOR ISSUE WITH THIS. I AM SO SCARED TO DRIVE THIS CAR NOW ON FREEWAYS OR ANYWHERE LONG DISTANCE. AND I'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR 3 MONTHS!
2020 SOUL EX WITH ABOUT 8100 MILES.  DRIVING ON INTERSTATE AND SUDDENLY TACH REDLINED AND LOST ACCELERATION/POWER.  LIMPED CAR INTO DEALER A COUPLE MILES AWAY, WHERE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND DIAGNOSTIC WARNING APPEARED ON DISPLAY.  DEALER CONFIRMED LATER THAT DAY THAT TRANSMISSION HAD FAILED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  PART IS NOT AVAILABLE AND NO ETA ON REPLACEMENT.
VEHICLE PULLS SHARPLY AND ABRUPTLY TO THE RIGHT AT SPEEDS ABOVE 45-50.  WHEN I TEST DROVE THE VEHICLE, I MENTIONED TO THE SALESMAN THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS PULLING TO THE RIGHT, OF COURSE HE DIDN'T FEEL IT, BUT WOULD HAVE IT CHECKED.  AFTER PURCHASING THE VEHICLE IN APRIL, AND OWNING IT ABOUT 7 MONTHS, THIS PROBLEM IS WORSE.  I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE PURCHASED, AND WAS TOLD THIS WAS NORMAL DUE TO THE LANE KEEPING ASSIST FUNCTION.  IF THIS IS THE CASE THIS IS DANGEROUS DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT IS A VERY SHARP AND ABRUPT PULL TO THE RIGHT, WITH NO WARNING.
The contact owns a 2021 Kia Soul. The contact received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 21V259000 (Engine). The contact stated that the check engine warning light was flashing. The vehicle was taken to the dealer for the recall repair. The dealer cleared the check engine warning light code and deployed the Piston Ring Noise Sensing System (PNSS) software. The dealer advised the contact to bring the vehicle back if the failure recurred. The dealer marked the recall as completed. The contact stated that the failure recurred, and the vehicle was taken back to the dealer, where DTC: P1327 (Piston Ring Noise Sensing System (PNSS) was retrieved, and the dealer diagnosed the vehicle with piston vibration. The dealer determined that the engine needed to be replaced; however, the dealer informed the contact that the failure was not related to the recall. The vehicle was not repaired, but the dealer cleared the diagnostic trouble code. Additionally, the vehicle was taken to AutoZone, where DTC: P1327 (Piston Ring Noise Sensing System (PNSS) was retrieved, and the contact was informed that there was a vibration in cylinder #3. The contact stated that the failure recurred, and the vehicle was taken back to the dealer, where DTC: P1327 (Piston Ring Noise Sensing System (PNSS) was retrieved; however, the dealer informed the contact that the vehicle passed the SC336 recall inspection test. The contact stated that the dealer performed the test in 20 minutes. The vehicle was not repaired. The contact stated that the engine was previously replaced at 67,000 miles. The dealer and the manufacturer informed the contact that once the district manager became available a determination would be made if the engine should be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 128,495.
I own a 2021 Kia Soul that was serviced under recall SC060, which involves inspection of the piston oil rings for potential defects. The recall service was performed at an authorized Kia dealership on May 12th, and I was informed that the engine passed the inspection and was operating properly.  However, on [XXX] after the recall service was completed, I noticed oil deposits on my spark plugs. Upon removal and inspection, the spark plug tips (combustion side) show clear evidence of oil contamination, which suggests that oil is entering the combustion chamber—exactly the type of problem SC060 was meant to address.  My car is definitely damaged, and my recall passed the inspection. That doesn't make sense. Kia Dutch Miller didn't give me proof of inspection of my car; they only gave me the invoice for the work done on the car.  I have photo evidence of the oil-contaminated spark plugs, and I am concerned this may lead to increased engine wear, misfires, or even total engine failure.  Please investigate whether recall SC060 is being resolved properly by dealerships, and whether additional remedies or extensions should be provided to affected owners like myself. My car hasn't been fixed yet.  Vehicle VIN: [XXX]  Mileage at time of recall service: 41,365 Date of recall service: [05/12/2025]   Location of dealership: Dutch Miller, South Charleston, WV  Thank you. INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
Hi I keep needed a oil change on this vehicle please have Kia to check why thanks and I sometimes smell oil out of no where thanks  [XXX]  [XXX]  and I have had serval oil changes at Walmart only since I got the vehicle from carmax  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
The contact owns a 2021 Kia Soul. The contact stated that during a routine inspection, the contact became aware that the oil level was low. No warning lights were illuminated. The vehicle was taken to a local dealer to be diagnosed and the contact was informed that a more comprehensive diagnostic test was needed to confirm the cause of the failure. The contact related the failure to NHTSA Campaign Number: 21V259000 (Engine); to the failure; however, the VIN was not included. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 34,000.
First off I do not use my lane keep assist. When traveling at any speed on a long curves of 100 to 150 ft or longer or sitting in a parking lot with the steering wheel angled between 15 to 30 degrees either left or right of center for 15 to 30 seconds the system will (in a sense) fall asleep. On the long corners this causes a dangerous situation for the driver and others because with the system falls asleep it will continue tracking the same course without recentering unless forced to re-engage. In other words it will not come out of the curve without forceful input from the driver. The vehicle has been in to the dealer where the issue has been dulpicated and confirmed by two technicians and dismissed by master tech without actually test driving. This issue should be labeled warning because serious injury or death will eventually happen.
On 12/28 at approximately 5:00 pm my vehicle shut off 2 times within a span of 30 minutes while I was driving it.  It happened on approach to a highway. It was NOT the Stop-Start System.  My car was moving while it happened.  My car lost all power, and every warning indicator flashed in my dash and I even lost my power steering.  I took my car to KIA and they categorized this as my car “stalling”, but I wouldn’t say that is accurate.  My car’s computer seems to have malfunctioned or was hacked.  Indeed KIA’s repair document shows that they performed a software update on my car to solve this.  My car’s engine was certainly malfunctioning while driving on 12/28 after both events of losing all power to my car.  It sounded like my engine was in the wrong gear after these events.  I didn’t drive my car after that episode and KIA refused to tell me what was wrong after they “repaired it” and performed a software update.  This article yesterday about KIA/other auto’s breached is unnerving.  I don’t feel safe driving the car and wish I had the ability to cut off KIA’s API to my car while driving.  They should only be allowed to perform software updates or access the car’s computer remotely while the car is stationary and the driver should be alerted that KIA or a third party is accessing the car’s computer and/or engine, etc.  I just want to make sure if I get in a serious accident that this is on record.  https://www.cyberscoop.com/car-hackers-vulnerabilities-research/

My kia soul had no warning lights until last week when it shut down completely while pulling into an intersection, I have just purchased it 6 months ago. The engine light came on along with the oil lamp, battery light and master warning light. The car shut down and after a few minutes came back on. It has been doing this randomly for a week now so its barely been driven. It had a p000a code so I took it to a kia dealership for repairs after having it checked elsewhere and being told it needs a new engine.  The repairs they quoted me at are over 4k and included the intake cam and intake and exhaust cam phasers. There is not much of a guarantee that this could not happen again if I spend it. I was told its unsafe to drive so its parked and may have to be defaulted on. I've seen others with similar issues while researching.
The contact owns a 2022 Kia Soul. The contact received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 25V099000 (Engine and Engine Cooling); however, the part to do the recall repair was unavailable. The contact stated that while driving at various speeds, there was a rattling sound coming from the front end of the vehicle. No warning light was illuminated. The vehicle was taken to a Take 5 oil change, which informed the contact that the oil level was 2 quarts low and had failed to show up on the dipstick. The vehicle was driven to the residence. The contact stated that the manufacturer had exceeded a reasonable amount of time for the recall repair. The dealer was contacted, but was unable to schedule an appointment or provide a time frame. A second dealer, Kia of South Austin (5306 S I-35 Frontage Rd, Austin, TX 78745), was contacted and informed the contact that it would take at least a day for a diagnostic test, and there was no time frame for the repair because parts were on backorder. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure and was willing to provide the contact with a reimbursement. The manufacturer opened a case. The approximate failure mileage was 91,500. Parts distribution disconnect.
When applying brakes over bumps the car sounds as if the brakes are locking up. When putting are in reverse and it uses the Automatic Emergency Braking aggressively too early. I have already paid to replace the window motors due to all windows not working when using the button on drivers side buttons, since replacing those motors the vehicle STILL continues to have electrical malfunctions when rolling windows down they won't roll up.
The contact owns a 2010 Volkswagen Jetta. The contact stated that while driving at an undisclosed speed, the ABS warning light illuminated. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic where it was diagnosed that the ABS control module software needed to be updated. An undisclosed dealer was notified of the failure and confirmed that the VIN was not included in a recall. The vehicle had not yet been repaired. The manufacture was notified of the failure however, the contact was awaiting a call back. The failure mileage was approximately 100,000.
the vehicle ABS module failed back in Nov2020 and was brought to local VW Dealer and diagnosed as bad module. fast forward to Aug 2021 and ABS module failed again and bad  wiring was found which is why the first module failed to begin with in my belief. both times when the module failed was after my wife slammed on brakes hard activating the ABS system which in turn caused the warning lights to come on and car go into limp mode. I tried limping the car to the dealership for repair and was almost hit by a large truck coming from behind as I had no response from the accelerator pedal.  I am not sure why this particular VIN was never added to the recall list as it fits the criteria as all other vehicles experiencing this issue. we paid $2600 the first time for the repair and are now out more money to have this known problem fixed again !
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE STOPPED, THE VEHICLE STALLED WITHOUT WARNING. THE VEHICLE WAS RESTARTED. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE ALTERNATOR AND TIMING BELT WERE RECENTLY REPLACED BY AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC. MCKENNA VOLKSWAGEN CERRITOS (18303 STUDEBAKER RD #5328, CERRITOS, CA 90703, 562-741-3035) WAS CONTACTED AND INFORMED OF THE FAILURE. THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED THAT THERE WAS A $249 DIAGNOSTIC FEE TO DIAGNOSE THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED NOR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 122,193. *BF*JB
ABS ENGINE LIGHT IS ON.  FOUND EVIDENCE ONLINE THAT VW EXTENDED COVERAGE FOR REPLACEMENT OF THIS MODULE. FAULT CODE FOR SAFETY RECALL FOR ABS MODULE IS 16V-913.  WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT MODULE IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY.  IN ADDITION, AIR BAG INDICATOR IS ON AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS ON. JUST HAD THE CHEAT DEVICE REMOVED TWO MONTHS AGO.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. WHILE DRIVING OVER A BUMP AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS, THE CONTACT HEARD AN ABNORMAL RATTLING NOISE COMING FROM THE VEHICLE. COMPASS MOTORS (200 DOLSON AVE, MIDDLETOWN, NY 10940, (844) 258-3818) INFORMED THE CONTACT TO CALL THE MANUFACTURER. UPON INSPECTING THE VEHICLE, THE CONTACT FOUND THAT ALL FOUR COIL SPRINGS WERE FRACTURED. THE REAR COIL SPRINGS WERE REPAIRED, BUT THE FRONT SPRINGS WERE STILL FRACTURED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 85,000.
THE  KEY CAN BE REMOVED FROM THE IGNITION WHILE THE TRANSMISSION IS NOT IN PARK ALLOWING THE VEHICLE TO ROLL IF ON A HILL.  THIS IS ONGOING
ENGINE STALLS OUT AS IF IT IS GETTING NO FUEL. IT HAPPENS WHEN IT IS STATIONARY, IN MOTION AND ON CITY STREETS ON OCCASIONS AND VERY DANGEROUS. SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE FUEL PUMP.
MY KEY HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO TURN IN THE IGNITION TO START THE CAR RECENTLY.  YESTERDAY I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM BUT THE CAR STARTED. AFTER DRIVING THE CAR THE KEY WOULD NOT TURN TO TURN OFF THE CAR. NO MATTER WHAT I CAN NOT GET THE KEY OUT OF THE IGNITION. I ONLY GOT THE MOTOR TO SHUT OFF BECAUSE MY SON KNEW TO PULL A FUSE AND THEN TAKE OFF A BATTERY CABLE.  THIS IGNITION PROBLEM IS SERIOUS AND IS A SAFETY ISSUE IF YOU CAN'T TURN OFF THE CAR.
WATER INFILTRATION:   THERE WAS A CLASS ACTION SUIT WON AGAINST VW FOR WATER INFILTRATION FOR MODEL YEARS THROUGH 2009, WHICH FILED BEFORE THIS VEHICLE WAS MANUFACTURED.  MINE IS A 2010, BUT MANUFACTURED IN 2009.   I NOW HAVE THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM, BUT HAVEN'T FOUND ANY EVIDENCE A NEW CLASS ACTION SUIT WAS BROUGHT OR THAT THE COMPANY HAS VOLUNTARILY RECALLED THE VEHICLES FOR CORRECTION.      THIS PROBLEM HAS RESULTED IN MY CAR TAKING IN ENOUGH WATER TO CREATE A 2" DEEP PUDDLE WHERE THE FRONT DRIVER AND PASSENGER PUT THEIR LEGS.  WHILE I THOUGHT I HAD EXTRACTED ALL WATER AND DRIED OUT THE CAR, I RETURNED 3 WEEKS LATER TO FIND THE INTERIOR COMPLETELY COVERED WITH MOLD/MILDEW, WHICH CREATES A HEALTH HAZARD FOR MOST, AND PARTICULARLY ME SINCE I HAVE ALLERGIES TO SOME MOLDS.  THE VEHICLE IS NOW PRETTY MUCH A TOTAL LOSS, AND IS VALUED AT $8000 - WHICH A RETIREE SUCH AS MYSELF CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE.    MY AUTO INSURANCE DOES NOT COVER THIS LOSS.    THE COURT CASE IS:  JOHN DEWEY, JACQUELINE DELGUERCIO, ET AL V. VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA, INC. ET AL. CASE NOS. 07-CV-2249-FSH-PS AND 07-CV-2361-FSH-PS (CONSOLIDATED))     THE FINAL DECISION WAS IN 2014, JOHN DEWEY, JACQUELINE DELGUERCIO, ET AL V. VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA, INC. ET AL.

2010 VOLKSWAGEN 2.0 TURBO DSG FAULT.    THE VEHICLE HAS BEGUN EXHIBITING DANGEROUS RANDOM/UNINTENTIONAL SHIFTING INTO MUCH LOWER GEARS, OR POSSIBLY EVEN NEUTRAL AT VARIOUS SPEEDS UNDER LIGHT OR NO THROTTLE INPUT ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS THUS FAR.     THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED THE VEHICLE WAS TRAVELING ABOUT 25MPH, AND THE DSG TRANSAXLE DOWNSHIFTED/SHIFTED INTO NEUTRAL FOR NO APPARENT REASON, ENGINE REVVING TO 4-5 THOUSAND RPM. THIS HAPPENED ROUGHLY FOUR TIMES BEFORE IT RESUMED NORMAL OPERATION    THE SECOND TIME IT HAPPENED WAS YESTERDAY AFTERNOON, ON THE HIGHWAY WITH SPEED CONTROL SET AT 58MPH. VEHICLE SHIFTED ALL BY ITSELF WITHOUT REASON, AGAIN REVVING TO 4-5 THOUSAND. THIS TIME IT HAPPENED TWICE BEFORE RETURNING TO NORMAL OPERATION.    ADDITIONALLY, ONE MORNING I ACCELERATED FROM A STOP WITH COLD ENGINE/TRANSAXLE IN DRIVE, AND THE TRANSAXLE WOULD NOT UPSHIFT FROM LOW GEAR FOR ABOUT 3-4 SECONDS. NOT SURE IF THIS IS RELATED, BUT I SUSPECT IT MAY BE.    THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED, THE ABS/ESP LIGHT FLASHED AND REMAINED ON, AND I TOOK IT IN TO THE DEALER EXPLAINING THE PROBLEM, AND THEY SAID MY REAR WHEEL SPEED SENSOR WAS FAILING. THIS IS THE ONLY INDICATOR OF ANY FAULT THAT I CAN TELL. WHEN THE CAR EXHIBITS THIS FAULT, I DO NOT NOTICE ANY FLASHING GEAR INDICATORS OR ANYTHING OF THE SORT, EVERYTHING SEEMS NORMAL, EXCEPT THE ENGINE REVS HIGH ALL BY ITSELF.    I DO NOT HAVE ANY PHOTOS OR VIDEO EVIDENCE OF THE FAULT AS OF YET AS IT'S VERY UNPREDICTABLE AND INTERMITTENT, BUT I WILL ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE THE PROBLEM IF I CAN IN THE FUTURE.
NONE OF THE DOOR LOCKS WORK, THEY DON'T LOCK. STEREO SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK, COMPLETELY BLACK. NO BLUE TOOTH AT ALL. SEAT BELT FRONT PASSENGER SIDE DINGS THOUGH THE BELT IS IN PLACE AND LOCKED.

DRIVING ON 2-LANE LEVEL ROAD, DRY WEATHER, DRY ROAD CONDITIONS, AFTER DRIVING FOR ABOUT 15 MILES, AT ABOUT 35 MPH, VEHICLE DROPPED OUT OF GEAR, APPEARED TO BE IN NEUTRAL WHILE MOVING. ABS/ESP LIGHT CAME ON DASHBOARD.  PUT ON FLASHERS AND HAND SIGNALED TO VEHICLES BEHIND ME AND CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP.   I SHUT OFF ENGINE AND WAS ABLE TO RESTART CAR, AND WENT A SHORT DISTANCE TO A STORE PARKING LOT, AND THE ESP LIGHT CAME BACK ON; AND THIS TIME THE GEAR SHIFT WAS LOCKED IN PARK AND FLASHING.   VW DEALER HAD REPLACED ORIGINAL REAR BRAKES (PADS & ROTORS) ON 4/16/15 AT 104.734 MILES.  VW CHECKED VEHICLE ON 4/28/2015 AND FOUND AN ERROR CODE 01315 IN THE ABS AND GATEWAY MODULES WHICH REPORTEDLY INDICATED INTERMITTENT  NO COMMUNICATION WITH THE TCM;  HOWEVER IT WAS FUNCTIONING AT THAT TIME.     AND CLEARED COMPUTER AND SAID IF PROBLEM RETURNED MECHATRONIC UNIT AND TRANSMISSION WIRING WOULD NEED REPLACED.   AT THIS TIME I ALSO NOTED NOISE IN BRAKES, AS IF THEY WERENT COMPLETELY RELEASING OR MAKING REAR BRAKES MAKING NOISE WHEN RELEASING BRAKE PEDAL.   THE PROBLEM DID NOT REOCCUR UNTIL ABOUT  3,000 MILES LATER AND AGAIN VEHICLE DROPPED OUT OF GEAR WHILE DRIVING AGAIN ON LEVEL ROAD AT ABOUT 35 MPH.  CAR IS CURRENTLY AT VW DEALER SERVICE AND MECHATRONIC UNIT AND TRANSMISSION WIRING IS BEING REPLACED.    I ALSO HAVE CONSISTENTLY NOTED TO VW SINCE 4,000 MILEAGE, PERIODIC SLIPPING IN LOWER GEARS, WHICH VW SAID THEY WERE UNABLE TO DUPLICATE.  ALL SERVICE MAINTENANCE COMPLETED AT SAME VW DEALER, INCLUDING ALL DSG TRANSMISSION MAINTENANCE.

I PURCHASED A 2010 JETTA AUGUST 2014 WITH 48,000 MILES. I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD CAR FOR MY DAUGHTER'S FIRST CAR. NOW 5 MOTHS LATER SHE WAS DRIVING AND THE RADIO JUST WENT OUT AND SCREEN WENT BLACK.CHECKED FUSES AND NOTHING. TALKED WITH VOLKSWAGEN AND NO RECALLS WHICH IF YOU GOOGLE IT THERE ARE ALOT OF THE SAME PROBLEMS. THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING. THIS MAKES ME VERY MAD THAT MY 16 YEAR DAUGHTER  USED HER MONEY TO BUY A CAR AND ONLY HAS 50,000 AND THEY WANT 800.00 TO FIX. THAT IS CRAZY!  I WILL NEVER BUY  VW AGAIN THEY DO NOT HELP ANYONE.  *TR
I STARTED THE MORNING OF 12/17/2014 JUST AS I DO EVERY MORNING: WENT OUT TO MY CAR, TURNED THE KEY OVER TO WARM THE GLOW PLUGS, AND STARTED IT UP. AS I PROCEEDED TO PULL OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY, I DID NOT NOTICE ANYTHING UNUSUAL. ABOUT 50 FEET DOWN THE ROAD ON A SLIGHT GRADE, MY CAR JUST CUT OFF. THERE WERE NO WARNINGS WHATSOEVER. THE GLOW PLUG LIGHT FLASHED, ALONG WITH A "SERVICE ENGINE" INDICATOR. SINCE I WAS ON A SLIGHT GRADE, I WAS ABLE TO ROLL BACKWARDS AND, WITH STRUGGLE, TURN THE WHEEL AND BACK INTO MY DRIVEWAY. THIS WAS A SAFETY ISSUE PRIMARILY BECAUSE AT ANY MOMENT SOMEONE COULD HAVE NOT REALIZED I WAS STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND SLAMMED INTO ME. I WAS HONESTLY FRIGHTENED FOR MY SAFETY AND WELL-BEING. THIS IS A WELL KNOWN HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP ISSUE.  *TR
PURCHASED A 2010 JETTA SPORTWAGEN TDI IN 2012.  PRE-CERTIFIED 2 YEARS OR 24000 MILES.  HAD THE ROUTINE MAINTENANCE DONE AS REQUIRED AND SUGGESTED.  AUGUST 2014, I PAID $600 TO HAVE THE ROUTINE MAINTENANCE DONE.  SEPTEMBER 2014, MY CAR IS DEAD.  AS I WAS DRIVING UP A HILL AT 55 MPH MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND I LOST POWER.  WASN'T SURE I WAS GOING TO MAKE IT HOME.  LUCKILY I DID.  HIGH PRESSURE PUMP WENT BAD, METAL SHAVINGS FOUND, CLEARLY A DESIGN / ENGINEERING ISSUE.  I HAVE SEEN SEVERAL ISSUES WITH THIS ON THE INTERNET.  VEHICLE NEEDS TO BE RECALLED.  FIRST ESTIMATE IS 5000-6000, I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER, SO THE SERVICE DEPT CAN TELL ME WHAT IS WRONG.  I AM SURE THEY WILL CHARGE MORE.  WORST PART IS I AM 7000 MILES OVER AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR THE PRE CERT COVERAGE ANYMORE.  WORST INVESTMENT EVER!  VW SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO NOT HAVE HAD DUE DILIGENCE AND RECALLED FOR THIS ISSUE. THIS MAY COST SOMEONE ELSE THEIR LIFE.   *TR
DRIVING AROUND CITY STREET. JETTA BEGAN TO LOSE POWER AND THE GLOW BULB INDICATOR BEGAN FLASHING.

CAR BEGAN TO BUCK AS IF NOT GETTING ANY FUEL THROUGH THE SYSTEM. CAR STALLED OUT ON HIGHWAY WITHIN A MINUTE OF THE SERVICE LIGHTS FLASHING AND WILL NOT RESTART. LUCKILY THE CARS BEHIND ME BARELY AVOIDED HITTING ME AS THERE WAS ZERO WARNING. HAD TO BE TOWED TO MY GARAGE, EXPECT DIAGNOSIS TOMORROW BUT AFTER READING UP ON OTHER COMPLAINTS I AM PRETTY SURE THEY WILL REPORT BACK THAT IT IS A HPFP ISSUE AND THE SYSTEM WILL NEED REPLACED.   *TR
I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT HOLD SPEED OR ACCELERATE. I PULLED OFF THE HIGHWAY AND THE VEHICLE STALLED OUT AND WOULD NOT RESTART. WE REPLACED THE HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP AND FUSE BOX. THE CAR STILL WILL NOT START AFTER A NEW FUEL PUMP AND FUSE BOX, AND WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE WIRING HARNESS NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.    *JS
HEARD A SMALL POP SOUND WHILE LISTENING TO THE RADIO AND THE SYSTEM WENT DEAD. CALLED VWOA AND THEY WOULD NOT OPEN A CLAIM. THIS IS THE SECOND RADIO AS THE ORIGINAL FAILED UNDER WARRANTY AND WAS REPLACED BY THE DEALER IN 2012. I WAS TOLD THE REPLACEMENT RADIO, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS REPLACED WITH AN OE RADIO, ONLY CARRIED A 12 MONTH WARRANTY WHILE THE ORIGINAL CARRIED THE FULL 36,000 THREE YEAR WARRANTY.  *TR
MULTIPLE LIGHT OUT WARNING SIGNAL, APPARENTLY THE FUSE BOX MELTED. THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN!  *TR
DRIVING AT ABOUT 40 MPH WITH ABOUT 1/4 TANK OF GAS WHEN CAR STARTED TO SPUTTER AND RUN ROUGH.  THE GLOW PLUG INDICATOR LIGHT BEGAN FLASHING AND I PULLED INTO A NEARBY PARKING LOT WHERE I SHUT THE CAR OFF.  I RESTARTED THE CAR AND PULLED OUT OF THE PARKING LOT BUT CAR IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO RUN ROUGH AND LOSE POWER AGAIN SO I PULLED INTO A GAS STATION LOT WHERE THE CAR REFUSED TO RESTART.  CALLED A TOW TRUCK AND GOT CAR TOWED TO AUTOBARN IN COUNTRYSIDE (WHERE I BOUGHT THE CAR).  TRIED TO RESTART CAR AGAIN AT DEALERSHIP AND NOTICED THE FUEL GAGE WAS READING "EMPTY", MEANING FUEL HAD LEAKED OUT SINCE THE CAR DIED.  DEALER CALLED ME THE NEXT DAY SAYING MY HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP HAD FAILED AND MY ENTIRE FUEL SYSTEM FROM THE GAS TANK ON UP TO THE INJECTORS HAD TO BE REPLACED.  WAS COVERED UNDER WARRANTY AND DEALER WAS VERY HELPFUL AND DID THE JOB IN FOUR DAYS, DURING T-GIVING WEEK, WHICH I WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH.  I ALWAYS GET MY DIESEL AT BP AMOCO'S OR MOBILES AND MAKE SURE TO USE HEAVILY TRAFFICKED STATION TO HAVE THE BEST CHANCE OF GETTING FRESH FUEL.  I AM NOT COMFORTABLE DRIVING THE CAR AND HAVE CONSIDERED TRADING IT IN DUE TO VW CORPORATE'S SEEMING INDIFFERENCE TO THE PROBLEM, WHICH IS WELL DOCUMENTED ONLINE AND THERE ARE MANY MANY CASES SIMILAR TO MINE.  SHORTLY AFTER I BOUGHT THE CAR I NOTICED THAT ALL THE FUEL STATIONS IN MY AREA WENT FROM 5% BIODIESEL TO 20% BIODIESEL.  I ASKED THE DEALER AT THE TIME ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE OWNERS MANUAL STATES VW WILL NOT WARRANTY THE CAR IF ANYTHING MORE THAN 5% BIODIESEL IS USED.  THE DEALER SAID VW WOULD WARRANT IT AND A WRITTEN STATEMENT FROM VW CAME IN THE MAIL SHORTLY THEREAFTER.  I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER IF THE HIGHER BIODIESEL PERCENTAGE LED TO THE FAILURE.  *TR
AFTER NORMAL REFUELING (WITH DIESEL, 100% CONFIDENT BASED ON THE STATION AND LOCATION OF THE PUMP), WITHIN TWO DAYS WE TOOK A SMALL 100 MILE TRIP.  40 MILES INTO THE TRIP FAILURE RESULTED AND THE ENGINE BEGAN TO STALL AT NORMAL HIGHWAY SPEEDS (70-75MPH).  NOT KNOWING THE NATURE OF THE FAILURE WE WERE ABLE TO LIMP ALONG UNTIL WE REACHED SAFETY AND WERE IN A LOCATION WHERE WE HAD ASSISTANCE IF NEEDED FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS.  WE TOWED THE CAR BACK HOME ($250), AND WHEN THE DEALER OPENED UP ON MONDAY WE WERE TOLD WHAT THE ISSUE WAS.  DOING SOME RESEARCH WE FOUND MANY, MANY OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME SCENARIO AS FOUND IN NHTSA INVESTIGATION EA11003.  OUR VEHICLE JUST EXPIRED ITS NORMAL WARRANTY (67,000 MILES) AND THE 2010 ONLY CAME WITH 60,000 MILE WARRANTY VS. THE CURRENT 100,000 MILE WARRANTY.  THIS ISSUE APPEARS TO BE ENTIRELY A DESIGN FLAW AND A KNOWN ISSUE.  WE LOVE THE CAR, AND IT HAS BEEN THE BEST CAR WE HAVE EVERY OWNED UP UNTIL THIS POINT.  I HOPE THAT VOLKSWAGEN ASSUMES RESPONSIBILITY AND KEEPS A LIFETIME CUSTOMER.  *TR
SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED IT HAS HAD ROUGH ACCELERATION AND INTERMITTENT SURGING BUT JUST RECENTLY IT HAS EXHIBITED ROUGH AND NO STARTS ALONG WITH STALLS WHICH ALL SEEMS TO BE DUE TO AN ISSUE WITH THE ECU LOSING DIAGNOSTIC COMMUNICATION WITH THE VEHICLE.  *TR
ENGINE STALLED AND SHUT OFF WHILE I WAS AT A 4-WAY STOP SIGN. CAR WAS TOWED TO VW SPECIALIST CENTER AND WAS DETERMINED THAT TDI FUEL PUMP AND INJECTOR SYSTEM HAD FAILED. VW SPECIALIST DETERMINED THAT THIS IS A COMMON EVENT WITH TDI FUEL SYSTEMS. FRESH DIESEL FUEL WAS FUELED IN MY VW AND DROVE FOR 6 MILES TO WHEN ENGINE STALLED OCCURRED. VW SPECIALIST INVESTIGATED AND DETERMINED THERE WAS NO CROSS CONTAMINATION OF DIESEL FUEL, WITH WATER OR GASOLINE. DIESEL FUEL WAS 100% DIESEL IN FUEL SYSTEM.  *TR
WHEN AN ENGINE STALL OCCURS, THIS CAR REQUIRES A FULL RESET BEFORE A RESTART CAN BE PERFORMED. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS WHEN SAID RESET HAPPENS WHILE THE CAR IS MOVING.    MEANING ' A FULL RESET MEANS THE IGNITION KEY MUST FIRST BE FULLY TURNED OFF. WHEN THE CAR IS IN MOTION AND THE KEY IS FULLY TURNED OFF, AT THAT TIME THE LOCKING GEAR IN THE IGNITION SWITCH ENGAGES AND LOCKS THE STEERING WHEEL...  WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION!!! THIS IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE IN THE MANUAL SHIFT TRANSMISSION MODELS.  *TR
FOUR FAILURES IN FOUR MONTHS.THIS IS A REPEAT FAILURE WITH MY DIESEL FUEL SYSTEM. I PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THE FIRST TWO OCCURRENCES ON THIS SITE. VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA HAS NOW REPLACED MY ENTIRE FUEL SYSTEM INCLUDING THE TANK.  THIS WAS ONLY AFTER REPEATED REQUESTS AFTER FOUR TIMES TO DEALER FOR SERVICE FOR THIS ISSUE--TOTAL TIME MY CAR WAS IN FOR SERVICE WAS 45 DAYS OVER JULY THROUGH OCT. 19, 2012.  I WAS AWARE OF THE FUEL PUMP FAILURE AFTER RESEARCHING GLOW PLUG LIGHT FLASHING TDI AND LIMP MODE IMMEDIATELY UPON THE FIRST TIME THE LIGHTS STARTED TO FLASH ON JULY 6, 2012.  I WENT TO DEALER AND THEY COULD NOT DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. JULY 17 IT HAPPENED AGAIN THEY FOUND METAL SHARDS IN THE FUEL FILTER AND REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP...I REQUESTED THEY REPLACE ENTIRE FUEL SYSTEM, EXPLAINING TO THE VOA CUSTOMER CARE PERSON THAT METAL SHARDS GO THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM, DENIED. PICKED UP MY CAR ON JULY 31 (AFTER 15 DAYS IN SHOP). ON SEPT. 17 WARNING LIGHTS/LIMPMODE AGAIN.  I AGAIN REQUEST THEY REPLACE ENTIRE FUEL SYSTEM, NO, ONLY THE PUMP IN THE TANK.  PICK UP CAR SEPT. 28 (12 DAYS IN SHOP). FOUR DAYS LATER ON OCT. 2, AGAIN WARNING LIGHTS/LIMP MODE.  BACK TO DEALER, AGAIN REQUEST VOFA TO REPLACE FUEL SYSTEM. NO ONLY THE FUEL RAIL.  DEALER REPLACES FUEL RAIL, TAKES FOR A TEST DRIVE AND IT FAILED ON THEM.  FINALLY VOA AGREES TO REPLACE THE FUEL SYSTEM...BUT NOT THE TANK.  ONLY CLEAN THE TANK.  I REQUEST NEW TANK, VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICAN TELLS ME I CAN GO INSPECT THE CLEANED OUT TANK...HOW WILL I SEE INSIDE THE TANK...VOA CUST SERVICE TELLS ME THEN I BETTER BRING A FLASH LIGHT.  MIND YOU I WAS DEALING WITH THE SAME CUST SERV REP [XXX] THE ENTIRE TIME.  THEY DECIDE TO REPLACE TANK.  PICK CAR UP OCT. 19 (18 DAYS IN SHOP).  WAITING FOR IT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. ONLY A MATTER OF TIME AND HOPE I DON'T GET IN ACCIDENT DUE TO IT.  VERY STRESSFUL.      INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).*TR

THE VEHICLE COASTED TO A STOP AS THE CONTACT MERGED TO THE SHOULDER. THE CONTACT ATTEMPTED TO RESTART THE VEHICLE AFTER TWENTY MINUTES, BUT THE VEHICLE DID NOT START. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER, WHO STATED THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO PRODUCE A FAILURE CODE. THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED THAT THE ENTIRE FUEL SYSTEM NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE REPAIR WAS COVERED BY WARRANTY. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 26,079.    UPDATED 6/15/12 *CN  THE CONSUMER STATED THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED,  THE CONSUMER WAS INFORMED THE METAL SHAVINGS WHICH ORIGINATED IN THE FUEL TANK MANUFACTURING PROCESS HAD MIGRATED TO THE MAIN LINE AND CAUSED A TOTAL BLOCKAGE OF FUEL SUPPLY TO THE ENGINE AND THIS WAS THE CAUSE OF THE ENTIRE PROBLEM. UPDATED 06/21/12

TOOK MY CAR TO GET THE OIL CHANGE AND WAS TOLD I HAVE A FUEL LEAK. LOOKED UP CAR ONLINE AT SAFECAR.GOV AND SAW THE 2010 JETTA HAS BEEN RECALLED FOR: POWER TRAIN:AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION/ FUEL SYSTEM, GASOLINE:DELIVERY:HOSES, LINES/PIPING, AND FITTINGS.     HAVING A FUEL LEAK IS MORE THAN DRAINING ON GAS MILEAGE IT IS A FIRE/EXPLOSIVE HAZARD. ON THE WEBSITE IT STATES:   CONSEQUENCE:  IF CHAFING OCCURS, THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR A FUEL LEAK TO DEVELOP. FUEL LEAKAGE, IN THE PRESENCE OF AN IGNITION SOURCE, COULD RESULT IN A FIRE.     I AM HAVING ISSUES WITH THE FUEL LEAKAGE AND NEED MY CAR RECALLED OR FIXED BY THE MANUFACTURER.

TRAVELING ON INTERSTATE AT ABOUT 65 MPH WHEN STARTED LOSING POWER AND THE GLOW PLUG LIGHT STARTED FLASHING THEN A COMPLETE STALL.  CAR IS STILL IN THE SERVICE DEPT AT VW.  VW STATED THEY ARE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT IS WRONG BUT SUSPECT IT WAS FUEL RELATED ("METAL SHAVINGS IN THE FUEL"). SAID THEY WERE SENDING IT OFF FOR TESTING AND MAYBE A WEEK OR TWO BEFORE THEY KNOW SOMETHING.  *TR
THE CAR CHRONICALLY STALLS IN FIRST OR SECOND GEAR IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC, AT VERY SLOW SPEEDS OR WHEN COASTING. WHEN GIVING IT GAS AND LETTING OUT THE CLUTCH, IT JUST STALLS WITH NO WARNING. HAVE SPOKEN WITH OTHER JETTA TDI OWNERS AND THEY ACKNOWLEDGE SAME PROBLEM
1. THE HORN IS HARD TO PRESS, AND SLOW TO REACT. A FEW TIMES I NEEDED TO USE FOR SAFETY AND ALMOST WAS INVOLVED IN ACCIDENT AS HORN DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY.  2. WHEN PRESSING THE HORN, ONE HAS TO PUT MORE THAN ADEQUATE PRESSURE.  ONCE IT IS PRESSED, THERE IS A DELAY OF ABOUT A SECOND BEFORE THE HORN BLOWS. IT OCCURS EVERY TIME IT'S PRESSED. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AS THE HORN IS A GOOD TOOL TO ALERT OTHER DRIVERS TO PREVENT COLLISION.  3. DEALER SAYS IT IS A NORMAL CHARACTERISTIC OF VEHICLE.
TL*THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA SPORTWAGEN.  THE CONTACT STATED THAT AFTER THE VEHICLE CAME TO A STOP AND SHE APPLIED THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL THE VEHICLE WOULD  NOT MOVE. IT TOOK HER ABOUT FOUR TO FIVE SECONDS BEFORE THE VEHICLE WOULD RESPOND BUT IT DID NOT STALL. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER WHO RAN A DIAGNOSTIC TEST BUT COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS DRIVEN BY TWO PEOPLE WITHIN THE SAME FAMILY AND THE FAILURE OCCURRED MORE THAN ONE TIME. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 5,857.
TL*THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 30 MPH, THE DRIVER CRASHED INTO ANOTHER VEHICLE. THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. THERE WERE NO WARNING LIGHTS ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL PRIOR TO THE CRASH. THE DRIVER SUSTAINED MINOR INJURIES. A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO AN INDEPENDENT GARAGE AND THEY ARE WAITING AN INVESTIGATION UPON APPROVAL. THE VEHICLE HAD NOT BEEN REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 2,800. THE VIN WAS UNAVAILABLE.
DSG TRANSMISSION IS SLOW TO ENGAGE 1ST GEAR WHEN STARTING FROM A FULL STOP.  THIS HAS CAUSED SEVERAL NEAR ACCIDENTS WHEN PULLING OUT INTO TRAFFIC FROM STOP SIGNS OR REDLIGHTS.  THERE IS A 2 SECOND DELAY FROM STEPPING ON GAS PEDAL TO CAR MOVING.  TRANSMISSION ALSO FEELS LIKE IT IS SEARCHING FOR CORRECT GEAR WHEN CRUISING RESULTING IN MOMENTARY LOSS OF MOMENTUM.  THIS MODEL IS AFTER 2009S RECALL FOR SIMILAR ISSUES.  PROBLEM HAS BEEN REPORTED TO DEALER AND REPLY WAS THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS, BUT IT'S ENTERED IN VWS DATABASE SO THEY CAN TRACK IT. *TR
ON FRIDAY, SEPT 10, 2010, WHILE DRIVING SOUTH ON THE I 605 FREEWAY (LOS ANGELES COUNTY) AT APPROXIMATELY 12 NOON AT SPEEDS OF 60 TO 65 MPH THE ENGINE, WITHOUT WARNING, DIED, STOPPED.  I MANAGED TO GET ONTO THE SHOULDER AND EVENTUALLY RESTART THE ENGINE.  THIS FAILURE HAPPENED TWO MORE TIMES ON THE FREEWAY.  ON THE FINAL STOP, AFTER CALLING VW, I WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE CAR AND COMPLETE MY DRIVE HOME (APPROX. 60 MILES).  THAT EVENING WHILE DRIVING TO THE LOCAL MARKET THE SAME THING HAPPENED WITH THE ENGINE TWO MORE TIMES.  I NOTIFIED THE DREW VW DEALERSHIP OF THE PROBLEM AND ARRANGEMENTS WERE MADE TO USE THEIR ROADSIDE SERVICE AND HAVE IT TOWED TO THE CARLSBAD, CA DEALERSHIP FOR DIAGNOSIS AND REPAIR.

NEW 2010 JETTA SE WITHOUT RAIN SENSOR WINDSHIELD WIPERS.  THE WIPER SPEED DECREASES WITH THE SPEED OF THE ENGINE AND DOES NOT CONSISTENTLY INCREASE WHEN THE ENGINE SPEED INCREASES.  WHEN I SLOWED AS I APPROACHED A YIELD SIGN IN A DRIVING RAIN, MY WINDSHIELD WIPERS SLOWED SO MUCH THAT I WAS UNABLE TO SEE OUT THE WINDSHIELD.  AS I ACCELERATED, THE SPEED DID NOT RETURN TO THE HIGH LEVEL AND I CONTINUED TO BE UNABLE TO SEE OUT THE WINDOW.  A REPAIR WAS ATTEMPTED, THE WIPER MOTOR REPLACED, BUT NO CHANGE HAS RESULTED.  I AM TOLD BY VW THAT THIS IS THE NEW DESIGN FOR THE WIPERS AND THERE IS NOTHING TO FIX. *TR
I recently bought a 2011 volkswagen jetta tdi last owner wasn't aware of recalls, car started throwing white smoke, my local service mecanics NORTHWEST EXPRESS AUTO CARE let me know that the problem is a recall on emission need to fix but dealer don't want to do it
Going down the road - in town - at about 35 mph and I started to hear loud clanking while I felt as the rear of the car felt "stiff" all of a sudden. I parked the car as soon as I could to check it over. The rear passenger side coil spring just snapped as you'd break a pretzel... I have never seen a broken coil spring in any of the cars we owned over three decades. As I looked for information online, it seems that this MK6 generation of Volkswagen vehicles made in MEXICO were manufactured with springs that are PRONE TO FAILURE! Even the next generation MK7 especially vehicles manufactured between 2015-2019 had a RECALL for this exact failure - 42J5. - 56,000 vehicles including Golf hatchbacks, Golf SPORTWAGEN, Jetta sedans and Tiguan SUVS.  How come VW didn't have a recall for the previous generation? Obviously this is manufacturing with below par parts.
This Jetta Sportwagen TDI is one of the "diesel gate" vehicles that was supposedly fixed. However, post fix, the vehicle has been at the dealership for repairs more than it has been on the road for various emissions related issues revolving around the exhaust gas recirculation system and diesel particulate filter.  Vehicle is washed regularly, including scrubbing of the chaise pipe ends with heavy duty soot cleaning solution. vehicle takes less than a week to collect enough soot on the tailpipe to cause transference to finger when whipped. This is an indication that an excessive amount of soot is not being properly recirculated by the exhaust gas recirculating system to be rebut in the diesel particulate filter. This also indicates that the "fix" for the cheating emissions system is not doing its job and vehicle is likely emitting particulate and NOX at levels far above legal limits.
I HAVE BEEN GETTING HORRIBLE GAS MILAGE (250 PER TANK). THIS HAS BEEN FOR OVER A YEAR NOW OF TRYING DIFFERENT THINGS (DRIVING, FUELING, REPAIRS, ECT.).
LEFT SIDE DOOR LATCH MALFUNCTION: UNABLE TO OPEN DOOR FROM LEFT REAR EVEN WHEN CHILD PROTECTION IS DISABLED. COULD BE A SAFETY HAZARD WHEN NEEDING TO EXIT VEHICLE.  FAULTY DOOR LATCH ISSUES ARE WELL KNOWN TO OCCUR. THE LATCH ON THIS VEHICLE HAS MALFUNCTIONED FOR THE LAST 5 YEARS. 05
TL* THE CONTACT OWNED A 2011 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AT 50 MPH AND THE VEHICLE REAR ENDED ANOTHER VEHICLE. NO FURTHER INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE. THE FRONTAL AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. THERE WERE NO INJURIES THAT REQUIRED ANY TRANSPORT BY AMBULANCE. A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED AND THE VEHICLE WAS TOTALED PENDING AN OFFICIAL RULING FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY. THE DEALER AND MANUFACTURER HAD NOT BEEN CONTACTED YET. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO TOW YARD. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 117,000.
WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER WE WENT TO HAVE THE BRAKES CHECKED AND FOUND OUT ALL THE BRAKES AND ROTORS WERE RUSTED SO BAD THE BUSHING WAS BROKEN OFF AND THERE WAS NO EMERGENCY BRAKE. THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WOULD NOT PASS INSPECTION YET THE DEALER SAID HE JUST HAD IT PASS INSPECTION. ALSO THE TI-ROD BAR IN THE BACK WAS BROKEN THE REAR SPRINGS WERE RUSTED AND BROKE.
I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AND I SMELLED BURNING PLASTIC. I REACHED BEHIND MY BACK AND BURNED MY FINGER. I PULLED OFF AND LOOKED AND SAW A HOLD AND MELTED SEAT. THE BACK OF MY COAT WAS MELTED AS WELL. I HAVE TAKEN IT TO A VW DEALER TO BE INSPECTED AND IT WAS CAUSED BY A WIRE SHORTING OUT. THERE IS A CASE NOW OPEN FOR ME WITH VW. WAITING TO HEAR IF THEY WILL PAY TO FIX THE SEAT.
IGNITION LOCK CYLINDER ABRUPTLY FAILED.  THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT START AT ALL DUE TO THIS FAILURE.  THEY KEY WOULD NOT TURN AT ALL.  IT WORKED ONE MOMENT AND IMMEDIATELY STOPPEDF WORKING.  STRANDED AND HAD TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED.  TOW COMPANY HAD TO DISASSEMBLE SHIFTER TO PUT THE VEHICLE IN NEUTRAL IN ORDER TO TOW.  $645 + FOR TOW AND REPAIRS.
TWO EXISTING RECALLS ON MY VEHICLE HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEM UPDATED AS COMPLETE IN THE SYSTEM.  THEY ARE: NHTSA RECALL NUMBER: OPENS NEW WINDOW TAKES AWAY FROM VIN LOOKUP SECTION>  11E036    RECALL DATE: SEPTEMBER 7, 2011    MANUFACTURER RECALL NUMBER:  26G9  AND   NHTSA RECALL NUMBER: OPENS NEW WINDOW TAKES AWAY FROM VIN LOOKUP SECTION>  14V656    RECALL DATE: APRIL 7, 2015    MANUFACTURER RECALL NUMBER:  42G8  I HAVE ATTACHED A PRINTOUT FROM THE VOLKSWAGEN DEALERSHIP THAT SHOWS THE INSPECTIONS AND IF NECESSARY CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO ADDRESS BOTH.

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING AT NIGHT, THE FRONT DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE EXTERIOR HEAD LIGHTS AND THE REAR DRIVER SIDE TAIL LIGHT BECAME INOPERABLE AS THE LIGHTS OUT ERROR MESSAGE DISPLAYED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 90,000.
WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY, THE DIESEL COIL LIGHT STARTED FLASHING AND OUR VEHICLE LOST POWER.  WE PULLED OFF OF THE ROAD, THE VEHICLE STALLED, SO WE HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP.  DEALERSHIP DETERMINED IT WAS A FUEL SYSTEM FAILURE(METAL IN THE SYSTEM) AND SENT THE FUEL TO BE TESTED.  TEST RESULT SAID INSUFFICIENT LUBRICANT IN FUEL, THEREFORE REPAIRS NOT COVERED UNDER EXTENDED WARRANTY.  DEALERSHIP INFORMED US THAT WE NEEDED TO BE USING "TOPTIER" DIESEL.  WE RESEARCHED THIS (HAVING NEVER BEEN TOLD THIS BEFORE) AND REALIZED WE HAD PURCHASED DIESEL FROM A "TOPTIER" LISTED STATION (SHELL). DEALERSHIP TOLD US TO MAKE A CLAIM WITH OUR INSURANCE COMPANY SINCE IT WAS AN "OUTSIDE INFLUENCE" THAT CAUSED THE FAILURE.  INSURANCE COMPANY IS INVESTIGATING WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A VALID CLAIM.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. WHILE EXITING THE HIGHWAY AT 20 MPH, THE VEHICLE STRUCK A POTHOLE AND THE FRONT DRIVER SIDE BRAKE ASSEMBLY FAILED.

ON FEBRUARY 1, 2014 I TURNED ON MY CAR AND HEADED TO CHURCH AT ABOUT 1 IN THE AFTERNOON, EVERYTHING APPEARED FINE. AFTER CHURCH I DID THE SAME; HOWEVER, SHORTLY AFTER I HAD LEFT THE CHURCH PARKING LOT THE GLOW PLUG AND BATTERY SYMBOLS STARTED FLASHING AND SUDDENLY MY ENGINE STOPPED. OUT OF NOWHERE MY CAR STALLED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, THANK GOODNESS I HAD MANAGED TO STEER TO THE SIDE AND THAT THE CARS ON THE ROAD MANAGED TO GO AROUND ME BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE TURNED OUT INTO A TRAGEDY. I HAD NEVER HAD ANY ISSUES WITH MY ENGINE/BATTERY NOR DID ANY OF THE DASHBOARD WARNING LIGHTS LIGHT UP PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT. I TRIED TURNING MY CAR BACK ON SEVERAL TIMES BUT IT WAS UNRESPONSIVE. THE BATTERY AND ALTERNATOR SOUNDED FINE BUT FOR SOME REASON THE CAR JUST WOULDN'T START BACK UP. COULD IT HAVE BEEN THE FUEL PUMP? MY CAR RUNS ON DIESEL AND I HAVE ALWAYS FUELED IT WITH THE APPROPRIATE FUEL WITHOUT ANY ISSUES SO WHAT NOW?  I HAD TO PUSH MY CAR OUT OF THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND CALL A TOW SERVICE TO TOW MY CAR HOME. OVER THE NEXT WEEK I DROVE A RENTAL TO WORK AND CALLED THE VOLKSWAGEN DEALERSHIP AND LEFT MULTIPLE MESSAGES FOR PARTS AND SERVICE AND FOR THE PERSON IN CHARGE OF EXTENDED WARRANTY.  IT'S BEEN A WEEK AND THEY HAVE NOT ANSWERED. MY CAR HAS BEEN OUT OF A WARRANTY NOW FOR A WHILE, HOWEVER I HAVE MAINTAINED IT AND GIVEN IT THE PROPER CARE SO IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE THAT A 2011 VEHICLE WOULD SIMPLY STALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD WITHOUT A WARNING. I AM SURE THAT THIS IS A MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT AND I WOULD LIKE FOR IT TO BE RESOLVED PROMPTLY, I AM SURE I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS HAD THIS ISSUE IN THE PAST AS I HAVE SEEN MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS ONLINE ABOUT THIS AND THERE HAS EVEN BEEN A FEW RECALLS FOR PREVIOUS DIESEL MODELS REGARDING ISSUES SIMILAR TO MINE.  *JS
STANDING WATER IN THE WHEEL WELLS TRACED TO SUNROOF DRAINAGE HOSES NOT ATTACHED TO DRAINS BECAUSE THE CLIPS MEANT TO HOLD THE HOSE IN PLACE  MALFUNCTIONED AND ALLOWED THE HOSE TO "BACK OUT" OF PLACE.  THIS PROBLEM WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY APPARENT AS CAR IS USUALLY KEPT GARAGED.  BODY SHOP, INTERNET DISCUSSIONS AND DEALERSHIP HAVE ALL REPORTED THEY BELIEVE THIS IS DUE TO A VW DESIGN FLAW.  THIS IS NOT A RESULT OF CONSUMER NEGLECT, MILEAGE OR AGE OF CAR.    THE CARPETING AND SOUND-DAMPENING UNDER PAD ARE TO BE REPLACED DUE TO MOLD AND MILDEW CONCERNS.  TO REPAIR, THE HOSES WILL BE RECLAMPED INTO PLACE.    TOTAL REPAIR COST ~$1700.  VW WILL COVER PARTS CITING "PART FAILURE," BUT DECLINES TO COVER LABOR COSTS.  PURCHASE OF "PLATINUM" LEVEL EXTENDED WARRANTY WITH NEW CAR WILL COVER ONLY 1/3 THE LABOR.    *TR
THE LATCH ON THE DRIVER SIDE HAS BECOME LOOSE.  AS I WAS DRIVING OVER SPEED BUMPS, I NOTICED THE DOOR WOULD RATTLE HARD.  I PULLED TO THE SIDE AND NOTICED THE LATCH ATTACHED TO THE CAR WAS LOOSE.  I TIGHTENED UP THE SCREWS AND THE DOOR WAS ABLE TO CLOSE TIGHTLY AGAIN.  A FEW WEEKS LATER, THE PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED AGAIN.  I TIGHTEN THE SCREWS, BUT THIS TIME, THE DOOR CANNOT CLOSE FULLY.  THIS IS WORRISOME, BECAUSE WHAT IF THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN AS I AM DRIVING?  THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN!  *TR
GLOW PLUG LIGHT STARTED BLINKING, THEN THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  SHIFTING BECAME ERRATIC.  PULLED INTO A SERVICE STATION, AND ONCE THE VEHICLE WAS TURNED OFF, IT WOULDN'T RESTART.  AFTER BASIC CHECKS, THE FUEL PUMP WAS PULLED FOR INSPECTION AND METAL SHAVINGS WERE FOUND.  IN RESEARCHING THE REPAIR, THE INDEPENDENT STATION SUGGESTED PUTTING THINGS BACK TOGETHER, AND HAVING IT TOWED TO THE DEALER, AS IT WAS SUSPECTED TO BE A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THE BOSCH HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP.  IN FACT IT WAS, AND WHILE THE CAR WAS TWO MONTHS OUT OF WARRANTY, THE DEALER WENT AHEAD AND COVERED THE REPAIR UNDER THE UNRELATED DRIVETRAIN WARRANTY.  I CONSIDER MYSELF INCREDIBLY LUCKY THAT THIS WASN'T 15 MINUTES EARLIER, WHEN I WAS TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, ON AN INCREDIBLY FULL FREEWAY.  IT COULD'VE BEEN A MAJOR ACCIDENT IF I HAD SUDDENLY LOST POWER.  CONSIDERING THERE ARE ENTIRE WEBSITES DEVOTED TO TRACKING THIS ISSUE, I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN A RECALL.  *TR
THE HIGH PRESSURE FUEL SYSTEM FAILED IN OUR CAR WHEN WE WERE ON A BUSY CITY STREET. 'ENGINE CONTROL MALFUNCTION' LIGHT STARTED FLASHING AND SUDDENLY OUR CAR WAS STALLED. WHEN WE LOOKED IN THE MANUAL IT SAID TO GET THE CAR TO A VW DEALERSHIP ASAP. WE HAD TO HOLD UP TRAFFIC UNTIL THE CAR WAS FINALLY TOWED. NOT ONLY THAT, THIS HAPPENED DURING LATE NIGHT AROUND 10 PM AND ALL THE SERVICE CENTERS WERE CLOSED. AFTER A PAINFUL 2 DAYS WE JUST FOUND OUT THAT OUT HIGH PRESSURE FUEL SYSTEM HAD TO BE REPLACED. THIS IS A  BIG STRUCTURAL DAMAGE WITH THE CAR AND I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE OWNING OR DRIVING IT.  *TR

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. THE CONTACT STATED THE EXHAUST TIP WAS EXTENDED BEYOND THE ORIGINAL LENGTH OF THE FACTORY-INSTALLED EXHAUST PIPES. AS A RESULT, THE EXHAUST PIPES BURNED A CHILD'S LEGS ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER ON ONE OCCASION BUT THE DEALER DID NOT REPAIR THE PROBLEM. THE CONTACT REFERENCED NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER: 11E036000 (ENGINE AND ENGINE COOLING: EXHAUST SYSTEM) AND CALLED THE DEALER. THE DEALER REPAIRED THE EXHAUST PIPE BY CAPPING THE TIPS OF THE PIPES PER THE RECALL. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED. THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 38,000.
TRAVELING IN THE LEFT LANE ON 95 N OUTSIDE BALTIMORE MD AT 65 MPH MY VEHICLE'S GAS PEDAL STOPPED RESPONDING AND THE CAR BEGAN TO LOSE POWER AND LURCH FORWARD AND EVENTUALLY DIE AS THE YELLOW DIESEL ENGINE INDICATOR ALONG WITH THE YELLOW ENGINE INDICATOR BEGAN BLINKING. I WAS ABLE TO AVOID TWO LANES OF TRAFFIC AND COAST OVER TWO LANES TO AN OFF RAMP BEFORE THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKED. AFTER CONTACTING VW ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO HERITAGE VW  LOCATED AT 9215 HARFORD ROAD #2  PARKVILLE, MD 21234 (877) 398-1963. IT WAS AFTER 9:00 P.M SO THE VEHICLE WAS LEFT IN THE LOT AND ALL THE PAPERWORK WAS DROPPED IN THE BOX.

OUR 2011 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA TDI DEVELOPED AN ENGINE OIL LEAK.  WHEN WE TOOK IT TO THE DEALER THE SERVICE MANAGER REFUSED TO LET US DRIVE IT DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ENGINE FIRE.  PER THE SERVICE MANGER THE OIL LEAK WAS CAUSING AN ATOMIZATION OF THE ENGINE OIL THAT COULD HAVE REACHED HEATED PARTS OF THE ENGINE OR EXHAUST AND CAUSED AN OIL FIRE.   *TR

ON FRIDAY, APRIL 15TH AT APPROX 10:30PM I WAS DRIVING MY 2011 VW JETTA TDI (WITH LESS THAN 1800 MILES ON IT) ON THE HIGHWAY APPROX 2 1/2 HOURS FROM HOME AND IT STALLED.  I COASTED OFF TO THE SHOULDER AND WAS NOT ABLE TO RESTART THE ENGINE. AFTER NEARLY 2 HOURS THE TOW TRUCK ARRIVED THAT VW ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE SENT AND THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP WHICH WAS ABOUT 60 MILES AWAY FROM THE BREAKDOWN POINT.  I HAD TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN A HOTEL IN A STRANGE AREA.  ON MONDAY, APRIL 18TH THE DEALERSHIP STATED AN OUTSTANDING ELECTRICAL RECALL WAS THE PROBLEM.  THEY CHANGED A WIRE HARNESS AND SOME FUSES AND THE CAR WAS READY FOR PICK UP.  I DROVE 100 MILES TO RETRIEVE MY CAR ON APRIL 18TH.  TODAY ON APRIL 19TH AFTER SITTING IN MY DRIVEWAY OVERNIGHT THE CAR WOULD NOT START AGAIN AND WAS TOWED TO THE NEAREST VW DEALERSHIP IN MY HOME TOWN.  STILL WAITING FOR WAITING FOR A DIAGNOSIS.

1 RECENTLY PURCHASED A (2011) VW JETTA AT "CHAPMAN VOLKSWAGEN" IN TUCSON, ARIZONA.IT SEEMED TO RUN WELL THE FIRST DAY I DROVE IT,BUT ON THE SECOND DAY OF PURCHASE I MADE U-TURN TO PROCEED ONTO THE HIGHWAY AND IT MYSTERIOUSLY DECELERATED. I PULLED THE VEHICLE OVER AS I WAS GOING ONTO THE ON-RAMP AND NOTICED THAT THE LOW FUEL LIGHT WAS LIT. WHAT STUCK ME AS BEING MOST PECULIAR WAS THAT THE REGULAR FUEL GAUGE WAS READING NEARLY HALF FULL. THE VEHICLE DID NOT STALL AND THE GAUGE RETURNED TO NORMAL FUNCTIONING, BUT IT LEFT ME WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE. I WAS WONDERING IF OTHER SIMILAR VEHICLES HAD SIMILAR ISSUES AND IF THEY WERE RESOLVED. THE REPRESENTATIVES AT THE DEALERSHIP ARE NOT RETURNING MY CALLS AND HAVE OFFERED NO EXPLANATION FOR THE INCIDENT.  *TR

KEY WILL NOT COME OUT OF IGNITION. RECEIVED A LETTER FOR AN "EXTENDED" WARRANTY ON THE ISSUE BUT WHILE I WAS UNDER 10 YEARS OLD, MY CAR WAS OVER THE ALLOTTED MILEAGE. I'VE BEEN TOLD THIS IS A $700 ISSUE. THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL BECAUSE IT IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH MANY OF THEIR CARS DURING THESE YEARS.

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS INVOLVED IN A FRONT END COLLISION. THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED. THE VEHICLE WAS OPERABLE AND WAS DRIVEN TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC FOR BODY REPAIRS. THE DEALER AND MANUFACTURER WERE NOT CONTACTED. THERE WAS ONE INJURY THAT REQUIRED MEDICAL ATTENTION. THE CONTACT EXPERIENCED SEVERE PAIN IN THE KNEE, NECK, AND BACK AREAS. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 129,000.

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. WHILE THE CONTACT'S SON WAS DRIVING 50 MPH, THE DRIVER HEARD A BANGING SOUND EVERY TIME THE VEHICLE JOLTED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO SCOTT VOLKSWAGEN (777 TAUNTON AVE, EAST PROVIDENCE, RI 02914) WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE FRONT DRIVER'S SIDE STRUT COIL SPRING FAILED AND BOTH FRONT STRUTS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 135,000.
I WAS NEITHER ABLE TO TURN OFF MY CAR, NOR TO REMOVE THE KEY FROM THE IGNITION. WITH THE KEY IN THE IGNITION, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO LOCK THE CAR FROM THE OUTSIDE. LEAVING AN UNLOCKED, RUNNING CAR JUST TO BE ABLE TO PROCURE THE SPARE KEY IN THE HOPES THAT THE CAR COULD AT LEAST BE LOCKED BY UTILIZING THE SECOND KEY ARE SIGNIFICANT SAFETY RISKS. FURTHERMORE, THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED LATE ON A WEEKEND NIGHT, NOWHERE NEAR THE SPARE KEY, RENDERING ME INCAPABLE OF TAKING THE CAR TO A DEALERSHIP WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME, FORCING ME TO LEAVE AN UNLOCKED CAR RUNNING FOR MANY HOURS. RUNNING EVENTUALLY OUT OF OPTIONS TO STAY WITH THE CAR, THE KEY BROKE OFF IN A LAST DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO TURN OFF THE CAR. LIVING IN A MAJOR CITY WITH MANY UNSAFE NEIGHBORHOODS UNDERLINES THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ABLE TO START AND TURN OFF A VEHICLE WHEN NEEDED, AS WELL AS TO LOCK THE VEHICLE TO KEEP ITS PASSENGERS  AND CONTENTS SAFE AT ALL TIMES.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. WHILE DRIVING 20 MPH, THE VEHICLE ACCELERATED FORWARD IN A JERKING MOTION WITHOUT WARNING. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER TO BE SERVICED PER A RECALL RELATED TO THE FAILURE; HOWEVER, THE FAILURE RECURRED. ALSO, A HOWLING SOUND EMITTED FROM THE ENGINE AND THE OIL AND CHECK ENGINE WARNING INDICATORS ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE DEALER, BUT THE FAILURE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED. IN ADDITION, THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE HEADLIGHTS BECAME INOPERABLE INTERMITTENTLY WITHOUT WARNING. THE CONTACT ALSO MENTIONED THAT THE FRONT DRIVER SEAT INDEPENDENTLY READJUSTED AND THE STEERING WHEEL SHOOK VIOLENTLY WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS DRIVEN. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER AND AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE PURGE VALVE AND THE STEERING RACK FAILED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE HAD NOT BEEN REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 66,000.
KEY GOT STUCK IN THE IGNITION WITH MOTOR RUNNING. COULD NOT TURN TO "OFF" POSITION. ALTHOUGH I COULD KILL THE MOTOR BY RELEASING THE CLUTCH (MANUAL TRANSMISSION), I STILL COULD NOT TURN THE KEY OFF AND, THEREFORE, WOULD HAVE TO JUST LET THE BATTERY DIE AFTER MANY HOURS OF SITTING THERE WITH THE KEY ON. I COULD NOT LEAVE THE VEHICLE UNATTENDED AS ANYONE COULD HAVE GOTTEN IN, STARTED IT RIGHT UP, AND LEFT WITH IT. DID A GOOGLE SEARCH AND FOUND THAT OPINION PLACED THE BLAME ON A FAULTY IGNITION SWITCH. ALSO DISCOVERED MANY OTHERS WITH THIS EXACT SAME PROBLEM WHO HAD TO HAVE THEIR IGNITION SWITCHES REPLACED, SO THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH VOLKSWAGEN.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNED A 2012 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. WHILE DRIVING 70 MPH, THE VEHICLE FAILED TO REMAIN IN POSITION AND THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE MOVED TO THE OPPOSITE POSITION WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL WAS TURNED. THE CONTACT VEERED TO THE LEFT AND THE STEERING WHEEL SEIZED. AS A RESULT, THE CONTACT CRASHED INTO A CONCRETE DIVIDER. THE AIR BAGS DEPLOYED. THE CONTACT SUSTAINED NECK AND SHOULDER INJURIES THAT REQUIRED MEDICAL ATTENTION. A POLICE REPORT WAS NOT FILED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED FROM THE CRASH SCENE AND WAS DEEMED DESTROYED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS PREVIOUSLY REPAIRED UNDER NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 14V656000 (SUSPENSION). THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 53,000.
BOTH OF THE LOW-BEAM HEADLIGHTS STOPPED WORKING AS I WAS DRIVING HOME ON A UNLIT HIGHWAY AT NIGHT. THE DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS WORKED WHEN I TURNED OFF THE HEADLIGHTS, AND THE HIGH-BEAM HEADLIGHTS WORKED WHEN I TRIED USING THEM. THE NEXT MORNING I REPLACED BOTH LOW-BEAM HEADLIGHTS AND THEY STILL DO NOT WORK.
WHILE DRIVING THE JETTA TDI AT 35 MPH, ALL OF A SUDDEN DASH LIGHTS FLASHED ON AND OFF AND CAR STALLED. WE WERE ABLE TO STEER CAR TO SIDE OF ROAD. THE CAR WOULD NOT TURN OVER AND WAS TOWED TO LOCAL VW DEALERSHIP. IT WAS DIAGNOSED WITH HPFP FAILURE AND THE METAL HAD CONTAMINATED MY ENTIRE SYSTEM AND NEEDED COSTLY REPAIR. FUEL WAS SENT FOR TESTING, AND WHEN VERIFIED THAT IT WAS NOT OWNER NEGLIGENCE VW REPAIRED THE CAR. THE WAIT WAS ALMOST 2 WEEKS.

VW DEALER HAS PHOTOS OF 20 CARS WITH THE SAME CONCERN, BUT TIRES ARE NOT COVERED BY VW, ONLY THROUGH TIRE MANUFACTURER. AFTER READING ALL THE OTHER HANCOOK OPTIMO 725A TIRE SEVER CRACKING, THIS IS A MANUFACTURER PROBLEM AND NEEDS INVESTIGATION.  *TR
ACCELERATING UP FROM A STOP SIGN VEHICLE WOULD NOT SHIFT.  PUSHED ON ACCELERATOR AND VEHICLE LOST ALL POWER AND WENT INTO LIMP MODE.

MY JETTA DIESEL ENGINE WAS HYDRO-LOCKED DUE TO WATER BEING PULLED INTO THE ENGINE FROM THE INTERCOOLER.   VOLKSWAGEN HAS A TSB (TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN) PUBLISHED FOR THIS EXACT PROBLEM (FROZEN INTERCOOLER)  - YET IS ONLY IMPLEMENTING OR OFFERING THIS TSB TO CUSTOMERS ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS.    IN MANY CASES - THIS IS WAY TOO LATE.     THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM AT VOLKSWAGEN -- AND BY NOT OFFERING THIS TSB TO ALL VW CUSTOMERS -- CATASTROPHIC ENGINE DAMAGE CAN OCCUR - IF THE RIGHT WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE MET.    FOR MY VEHICLE, WHEN STARTING UP MY CAR - AT THE END OF THE DAY, TO LEAVE AND RETURN HOME --> WHEN STARTING THE CAR - IT ACTED AS IF THE BATTERY WAS DEAD.  AT THIS POINT, WATER WAS INGESTED INTO THE 3RD CYLINDER, THE PISTON ROD OF THE 3RD CYLINDER WAS BENT, AND ENGINE DAMAGE WAS DONE.   VW SHOULD NOT BE OFFERING THIS TSB TO ALL TDI (TURBO DIESEL ENGINE) OWNERS WHO COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE TSB.    CATASTROPHIC ENGINE DAMAGE BY NEGLECTING TO PERFORM A KNOWN TSB IS CREATING A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION ON THE ROADS.   *TR
AROUND NOON TIME THIS PAST SATURDAY MY SON WAS RETURNING FROM A NEIGHBORHOOD STORE AND THE CAR STALLED AT THE ROADSIDE ABOUT 1/2 MILE FROM HOME. HE CALLED AND REPORTED THE CEL AND "COIL" LIGHT BLINKING ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL. I WAS ABLE TO START THE CAR, CONFIRMING THE SAME LIGHTS WERE BLINKING AND DROVE THE REST OF THE WAY HOME. AT HOME I CALLED THE VW SERVICE REP AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT THAT SAME AFTERNOON. WE PROCEEDED TO TAKE THE CAR IN A SHORT WHILE AND IT STALLED AGAIN ENROUTE - WOULD NOT RESTART & HAD TO CALL FOR A TOW. AFTER TELLING THE VW SERVICE MGR WHAT HAD HAPPENED HE IMMEDIATELY CALLED FOR A MECHANIC TO BRING SOME TOOL AND PROCEEDED TO TAKE THE TOP OF THE FUEL FILTER HOUSING. AS HE SUSPECTED THERE WERE SMALL FILINGS OF METAL IN THE FUEL FILTER HOUSING. HE THEN TOLD ME THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE SOME HPFP FAILURES  AND THEY WOULD BE REPLACING IT WITH ONE FROM ANOTHER MFGR. HE ALSO SAID VW DEALT WITH RESOLVING THIS ISSUE BY REPLACING THE ENTIRE FUEL SYSTEM. I AM REPORTING THIS ISSUE BECAUSE I HAVE READ MULTIPLE INSTANCES ON THE INTERNET OF THIS HAPPENING AND VW REPORTING THAT IN MANY CASES OWNERS HAD CONTAMINATED THE FUEL SYSTEM WITH GASOLINE. I FUEL ALL THE CARS FOR OUR FAMILY AND HAVE NEVER PUT GASOLINE IN OUR JETTA'S FUEL SYSTEM. I HAVE ALL OUR FUEL RECEIPTS FROM THIS YEAR, AND UP TILL A FEW MONTHS AGO HAD ALL OUR 2012 RECEIPTS AS WELL. MY WIFE IS THE HIGH-USE DRIVER OF THIS VEHICLE. I THINK I'M VERY FORTUNATE THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN TO HER ON THE FREEWAY DURING HER COMMUTE TO/FROM WORK.  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. THE CONTACT STATED WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 10 MPH, THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY STALLED AND THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO IDLE EXCESSIVELY.

ON 9 MARCH 2012, I BOUGHT A VW TDI JETTA SPORTSWAGEN WITH AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION.  FROM THE TIME I TOOK POSSESSION OF THE VEHICLE, THE TRANSMISSION BUCKED, HESITATED, AND LUNGED.  I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP ON 26 APRIL TO HAVE IT EXAMINED, BUT THEY SAID THAT IT WAS ?NORMAL? AND THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE.  I TOLD THEM THAT IF THAT WAS NORMAL, I WAS SURPRISED THAT ANYONE WOULD WANT TO BUY ONE.  AFTER 2 MONTHS OF THIS, I TOOK THE CAR BACK AND EXCHANGED IT FOR ONE WITH A MANUAL TRANSMISSION.  I BELIEVE THE SO-CALLED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION (WHICH IS REALLY A MANUAL TRANSMISSION WITH 2 CLUTCHES CONTROLLED BY A COMPUTER) IS INHERENTLY DANGEROUS.  *TR
2013 Jetta TDI with 92k miles. I am the third owner of this car which has been regularly maintained since new with all service records, including a 2019 emissions modification per VW recall. I bought this vehicle less than a year ago. My son was driving to work when the car shut off without warning. He was able to restart it and park safely and had it towed home. After replacing the battery and a fuse, the car continued to show a code for the ECM Power Relay Load Circuit . We took it to the mechanic to have it inspected, and learned that the high pressure fuel pump had imploded and metal shavings were found throughout the entire fuel system. This is evidently a common and very costly issue that VW has an obligation to fix. They knowingly continue to use a defective part that is essentially a ticking time bomb without regard to the owners safety and the financial ramifications of the repair. All VW vehicles with this defect should be covered by VW, not just selected model years and models. This causes catastrophic damage and VW is completely negligent by not doing what is right by the customer. The VW dealer quoted a $9,000. repair and VW North America declined any assistance with the vehicle. The car is not worth that, and it would be absurd to pay out of pocket for the repair; especially since VW continues to use a defective designed HPFP that can eventually fail again. VW was selective in the model years that they recalled, but only after the parts failed. They should have applied the recall and repairs to ALL vehicles proactively. I now have a 2013 paperweight in my driveway. The reason I purchased this specific car was for the longevity that diesels are known for. What a shame that VW does not rectify the situation in lieu of the previous diesel scandal. I'll be going back to Volvo or Subaru, two companies that I have had great experiences with, both in safety and reliability. VW should do the right thing, but I guess that's of no importance anymore.
My vehicle has the Mechatronic failure that the recall is open for some 13’ Jetta hybrids but I don’t have an open recall for it. The car would start shutting on and off constantly at stop lights instead of staying off running soley on battery power. The error codes are pointing to a failure to maintain fluid pressure inside the mechatronics unit. The mechatronics unit is included in a VW recall from June 2021. There was a design flaw in the housing that caused transmission fluid to lead out under pressure. My vehicle should be included in the recall but since I don’t have an open recall for this to my vehicle I can’t get it fixed and repairs are to expensive for something VW should own up for this mistake but they won’t repair it.
The door locks will try to auto-lock once the vehicle has passed a set speed but fail, making an audible double-lock sound. The car will continue to try and auto-lock after each stop (stop sign, stop light, etc) and continue to fail. Happens intermittently.
The brake system has malfunctioned, and I would be happy for you to inspect it. The brakes come on suddenly when the foot brake is not being applied. The car will not move when this happens, creating a very dangerous situation on the road. I have been stranded in a lane with cars zooming around me. Everyone is at risk. A tech on the VW helpline confirmed the problem with my mechanic and suggested two very expensive fixes which have not resolved the problem.  There have been no warning indicators for this problem. It happens randomly and unexpectedly.
E-Engine and Transmission Problem.  In August of 2021, while performing normal driving, the car refused to get in gear and the engine just revved; the Check Engine and Hybrid Systems Failure lights came on, and the car would not work properly.  I had it towed to a VW Dealership in Springfield, VA for repairs and was quoted $15,000 for a new E-Engine and Transmission.  No Recalls, but online forums show that this is a classic failure of Jetta Hybrids and is due to the corrosive transmission oil used in the sealed transmissions of the Hybrids.  Car has remained on VW Dealership lot while a decision is made on the vehicle. November of 2021 I was contacted about a different recall (38C4) for the Jetta; it is a software issue with a European Calibration instead of a US.  I am looking to have that repaired to see if it fixes the problem in the car. I am inquiring about the Volkswagen recall 34J6 (or 34J6/4V) for 2013/2014 VW Jetta Hybrids.  My VIN does not appear on the list.  According to forums, it has experienced the same failure as others that are.  This one is for hairline cracks that may form in the Transmission causing it to fail. No warning signs were given before the failure.  It was a well maintained car; I was the only owner and drove it for 121,000 miles.
COIL SPRINGS BREAK RANDOMLY IN COLD WEATHER MAKING CAR HANDLE ERRATICALLY AND WITHOUT WARNING. VW HAS RECALLED MANY COIL SPRINGS ON OTHER MODELS BUT NOT THE JETTA HYBRID WHICH USES THE SAME COMPONENTS. VERY UNSAFE.
I STARTED MY CAR WITH NO ISSUE BUT WHEN IT WAS PUT INTO REVERSE IT BEGAN MAKING A HORRIBLE CLUNKING/GRINDING NOISE THEN SHUT OFF AND COULD NOT START AFTER. TO BE CLEAR: THE CAR WAS IN MOTION BEFORE MAKING THE NOISE AND SHUTTING DOWN, BUT HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE DYING. I DID NOT MAKE IT OUT OF THE PARKING LOT. IT HADN'T HAD ANY ISSUES AT ALL BEFORE THIS AND HAS ALWAYS HAD IT'S MAINTENANCE TAKEN CARE OF ON TIME.   WE TOOK IT TO A VW DEALERSHIP TO HAVE IT CHECKED AND IT TURNED OUT THAT THE ENTIRE TRANSMISSION NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. WE HAD IT REPLACED AND IT SEEMED TO BE RUNNING OKAY, BUT AS SOON AS WE TOOK IT HOME IT WOULDN'T START UP AGAIN. WE ONCE AGAIN TOOK IT TO A DEALERSHIP AND FOUND THAT THE MECHATRONIC UNIT WAS ALSO BAD. WE HAD TAKEN IT IN TO HAVE IT CHECKED SINCE WE HEARD THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE MECHATRONIC UNITS IN SOME VW VEHICLES BUT WE'RE TOLD THAT IT DIDN'T APPLY TO OUR VIN NUMBER. I BELIEVE THAT THEY DID NOT INCLUDE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CARS IN THE RECALL THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED. I AM DEFINITELY NOT THE FIRST PERSON TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN AFTER BEING TOLD THAT THE RECALL DIDN'T APPLY TO THEIR CALL.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA.

THE CONTACT PLACED THE VEHICLE IN PARK FOR 30 SECONDS AND ATTEMPTED TO RESTART THE VEHICLE HOWEVER, THE VEHICLE FAILED TO RESTART. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER (MISSION BAY VOLKSWAGEN ' (ADDRESS 2205 MORENA BLVD, SAN DIEGO, CA 92110) TO BE DIAGNOSED. THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED THAT THERE WAS A CRACK IN THE TRANSMISSION WHICH CAUSED OIL TO LEAK INTO THE ELECTRICAL GEAR BOX. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 47,000.
WHEN INSERTING KEY AND TURNING TO START IGNITION, THE KEY HAS TO BE WIGGLED A LITTLE BIT TO GET IT TO TURN. ALSO, WHEN TURNING IGNITION OFF IT IS EVEN HARDER TO TURN OFF, YOU HAVE REALLY WIGGLE AND TWIST TO THE POINT WHERE YOU'RE ALMOST FORCING IT TO TURN OFF. THE HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT OF THE STEERING WHEEL AFFECTS HOW HARD IT IS TO TURN ON AND OFF. I ALWAYS HAVE THE CAR PARKED WHEN TURNING ON AND OFF THE IGNITION. IT'S BEEN DOING THIS FOR THE LAST YEAR ABOUT BUT HAS BECOME MORE OFTEN THIS HAPPENS IN THE LAST MONTH.

MY 18 YEAR WAS DRIVING THE CAR DOWN A SIDE STREET WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR AND THE CAR WOULDN'T STOP. SHE WAS ABLE TO AVOID HITTING ANYTHING OR ANYBODY BY PULLING TO THE SIDE AND ALLOWING THE CAR TO DRIFT TO A STOP. THE CAR HAS APPROXIMATELY 43000 MILES AND JUST CAME OUT OF WARRANTY LESS THAN 9 MONTHS PRIOR TO INCIDENT. CAR WAS TOWED TO A VW DEALER WHERE IT WAS DISCOVERED THE MASTER BRAKE CYLINDER HAD FAILED. VW REFUSED TO COVER THE REPAIR WHICH WAS OVER $1000. VW INSISTS THIS IS NOT A CHRONIC PROBLEM ON THEIR VEHICLES DESPITE THE FACT THAT COMPLAINTS OF EXACTLY THIS PROBLEM ARE PREVALENT ON THE INTERNET.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. WHILE DRIVING 35 MPH, THE VEHICLE STALLED WITHOUT WARNING AND VARIOUS WARNING INDICATORS ILLUMINATED.

IGNITION SWITCH GETS STUCK BOTH WHEN STARTING AND WHILE STOPPING, HAD TO LET MY CAR RUN FOR HOURS BEFORE I HAD TO WIGGLE OUT THE KEY, DONT THINK THIS WILL WORK FOR LONG.
THERE IS EXCESSIVE CONDENSATION IN MY PASSENGER SIDE HEADLIGHT.  THIS ISSUE LOWERS THE HEADLIGHT VISIBILITY THE DEALER SAID THIS IS NORMAL AND SHOULD BE CORRECTED AFTER 30 MINUTES OF THE LIGHTS BEING ON.  THE ISSUE STILL OCCURS AND IS CONSISTENT.  THE ISSUE OCCURS WHILE THE VEHICLE IS STATIONARY AND IN MOTION.
HEAD LIGHTS BULBS ARE PREMATURELY BURNING OUT.. TEE BULBS WERE REPLACED AT THE VOLKSWAGEN DEALERSHIP. ONE NIGHT WHILE I WAS DRIVING BOTH OF MY HEADLIGHTS WENT OUT AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME AND SINCE THEN I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE MY BULBS TWICE AND MY DAYLIGHT RUNNING LIGHTS.
IGNITION SWITCH WILL NOT RELEASE THE KEY CAN NOT TURN OFF ENGINE( THREE TIMES THE WEEKEND OF 6 11 2016)
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. WHILE DRIVING 25 MPH, THE VEHICLE SPONTANEOUSLY IGNITED INTO FLAMES. THE FAILURE HAPPENED WITHOUT WARNING. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE HAD AN ABNORMAL ODOR PRIOR TO THE FIRE. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE.

MY CAR IS A VW JETTA TDI 2013, 95,000 MILES, NOT EVEN 3 YEARS OLD, GOT IT BRAND NEW. I STARTED TO DRIVE AWAY AFTER DOING SOME SHOPPING. AS I WAS LEAVING THE PARKING LOT, THE CAR STALLED. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME UP AND SO DID THE GLOW PLUG LIGHT. THE CAR DID NOT START AGAIN AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS. I HAD IT TOWED TO THE SHOP. THE DAY AFTER, I WAS TOLD THAT THE FUEL PUMP HAD DISINTEGRATED DUE TO THE INTERNAL HEAT. WHEN DOING SO, ALL THE DEBRIS WENT INSIDE THE FUEL SYSTEM AND ENGINE. IN ORDER TO REPAIR IT, THE VW CAR DEALER SAID THEY HAD TO OPEN ALL THE SYSTEM AND FLUSH IT TO CLEAN EVERYTHING AND THEY WOULD CHARGE SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FIX THAT. ALTHOUGH I WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THEIR DIAGNOSTIC AND PRICE, I HAD TO DO IT. I NEED THE CAR TO GET AROUND TO GO TO WORK. I TOLD THE CAR DEALER THAT THIS INCIDENT WAS NOT NORMAL. THEY SAID THAT THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT. I HAVE DONE ALL THE SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE AS SUGGESTED BY THE MANUFACTURER. ON THE OTHER SIDE, IT JUST HAPPENED THAT LAST WEEK, VW ISSUED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR UP TO 120,000 MILES FOR THE FUEL PUMP FOR DIESEL CARS YEARS 2011 AND 2012. I CALLED  THEM AND THEY SAID THAT THEY COULD NOT COVER THE 2013. OBVIOUSLY, THEY KNOW SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THOSE PREVIOUS MODELS. I THINK THEY SHOULD INCLUDE THIS PROBLEM AND EXTEND THE FUEL PUMP WARRANTY FOR THIS CAR AS WELL AND -IN THIS CASE, COVER FOR THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT THIS IS GOING TO COST ME FOR HAVING A "FAULTY PUMP".

THE DUNLOP SPORT SP 01 A/S 18" TIRES THAT COME AS STANDARD ON CERTAIN TRIM LEVELS OF THE VW JETTA GLI / GTI ARE DEFECTIVE IMO.  I AM NOW GOING TO REPLACE THE 4TH TIRE IN 29,000 MILES OF DRIVING THE VEHICLE SINCE NEW FROM THE SAME / SIMILAR ISSUE; BUBBLES AND SIDEWALL DEFECTS, AND MOST RECENTLY AS OF TODAY A BLOWOUT IN THE LEFT LANE OF A 4 LANE HIGHWAY AT 65 MPH AFTER A MINOR ROAD IMPACT (DID NOT JAR CABIN OR WASN'T PARTICULARLY SEVERE) 200 MILES ALWAYS FROM HOME.  GO ONLINE TO PLACES LIKE TIRERACK.COM AND SEARCH THE WEB, THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME THING WITH THIS TIRE AND IN THE APPROXIMATELY 30,000-40,000 MILES A YEAR OF DRIVING I PUT ON TWO VEHICLES COMBINED (IN WHICH I AVERAGE A NEW CAR PURCHASE EVERY YEAR AND HALF), ONLY THESE TIRES HAVE EVER BEEN AN ISSUE AND VW EQUIPS THESE ON BOTH THE GLI AND GTI WITH THE SAME SAID COMPLAINTS, WHILE OTHER BRANDS OF TIRES IN THE SAME SIZE DO NOT HAVE THE COMPLAINTS LIKE THESE.  I DO REALIZE THEY ARE LOWER PROFILE AND COULD BE PRONE TO MORE SIDEWALL DAMAGE, BUT IN ALL HONESTY THEY ARE JUST NOT BUILT TO PRACTICAL HIGHWAY STRENGTH STANDARDS AS I AGAIN DRIVE OTHER VEHICLES IN THE SAME CONDITION WITH NO ILL TIRE AFFECTS.  AFTER TODAY'S HIGHWAY BLOWOUT I REALIZE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE MORE THAN JUST A NUISANCE AS A LESS EXPERIENCED DRIVER MAY HAVE HAD AN ACCIDENT.  VW OF AMERICA COULD MOST LIKELY ELIMINATE THIS BY FITTING THEIR VEHICLES WITH OTHER BRANDS.  *TR
THE BLUE TOOTH SYSTEM IN ALL OF THE 2013 AND 2014 JETTA WAGONS IN DEFECTIVE. VOLKSWAGEN KNOWS THE SYSTEM IS DEFECTIVE, THE DEALERS KNOW IT IS DEFECTIVE, BUT THEY CONTINUE TO MARKET AND SELL CARS WITH NO PROPOSED FIX TO THE SYSTEM. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT ALL OF THE 2013 AND 2014 JETTA WAGONS HAVE THIS PROBLEM BUT I ONLY STATE THAT MINE HAS HAD BLUE TOOTH PROBLEMS FROM DAY ONE, CALLS DROPPED, UNINTELLIGIBLE CALLS, DID NOT DIAL, ETC. I BELIEVE BOTH VOLKSWAGEN AND THE DEALERS HAVE CONSPIRED TO CONTINUE TO MARKET THE CARS AND JUST TELL THE PUBLIC THAT THEY ARE WORKING ON A FIX WHEN IN FACT THEY ARE NOT. AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TOLD. THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE IN ANY STATE WHERE CELL PHONES ARE PROHIBITED FROM BEING USED, LIKE UTAH. I BELIEVE THAT ALL OF THE JETTA WAGONS SHOULD BE RECALLED, ALL SALES OF NEW WAGONS STOPPED, AND THAT BOTH THE DEALERS AND VOLKSWAGEN SHOULD BE FINED FOR KNOWINGLY MARKETING AND SELLING A DEFECTIVE CAR.  *TR
THE JETTA WAS BEING TEST DRIVEN BY QTM FROM VOA WITH PASSENGER RICK NELSON, SERVICE MANAGER OF BOB BAKER VOLKSWAGEN VW WHEN GETTING ON THE 5 FREEWAY ON THE LAS FLORAS ON RAMP WHEN THE CAR SHIFTED BETWEEN 3RD AND 4TH GEAR THE ENGINE MISSED. THE QTM COMMENTS ON THE MISS AND STATES THAT HE DOESN'T THINK IT TRIGGERED A FULL MISFIRE, BUT THEN INQUIRED TO RICK NELSON ABOUT THE TSB THAT LISA HAS REGARDING MISFIRE, TSB 01-13-14. QTM ALSO EXPERIENCED AND ACKNOWLEDGED LOSS OF POWER AND THROTTLE RESPONSE AT APPROXIMATELY 60 MPH WHILE HE WAS DRIVING NORTH ON THE 5 FREEWAY. THE QTM AND RICK NELSON AGREE TO OPEN A VTA AND THE QTM STATES THAT HE WILL TAKE IT OVER AND PUT HIS NOTES IN IT. THESE ARE THE ISSUES THAT I CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE WITH THE CAR AND WHY I BROUGHT THE CAR IN FOR SERVICE. THE ODD THING IS THAT THE SERVICE INVOICE GENERATED AND GIVEN TO ME STATED THAT THERE WERE NO ISSUES FOUND DURING THE TEST DRIVE. THE STATEMENTS ON THE SERVICE INVOICE ARE FRAUDULENT AND IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE QTM AND SERVICE MANAGER DURING THE TEST DRIVE. I CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE THE CAR MISSING WHILE IN SPORT MODE AND LOSS OF THROTTLE RESPONSE WHILE IN DRIVE.. THE STATUS OF THE VTA AND ITS CONTENTS ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION. AS FAR AS THE REPUTATION OF THE QTM FROM VOA AND THE DEALERSHIP AND ITS SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT BOB BAKER VW, I THINK THEIR FRAUDULENT STATEMENTS ON MY SERVICE INVOICE SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. .
[XXX] driving on [XXX] , my car accelerated to almost redline without me pushing the pedal, I tried the brake only to find it didn't control the car., it died in the slow lane, no power anything. Eng lite was on, towed to my mechanic, he couldn't find why but the code said EGR, so he cleaned and replaced glow plugs, & regen'd the DPF to 0..  so I picked up the car, and a few days later, it did it again through a 4way stop. I called vw & was told to go to the dealer. Oakland VW inspected & said need new DPF $6K.  Since the filter doesn't affect throttle, I declined, plus in 2022 on an extended warranty I went to dealer to have the filter replaced, instead they regen'd it  & left the bad part in my car. Now the corporate Care Manager wants the DPF replaced for $6K b4 proceeding with any further testing to identify the source of the acceleration problem.  The shop mgr, Joseph, was test driving & the car did take off and was not stoppable with the brakes.  That was confirmed, yet VW of America is still in a holding pattern and cannot explain why this is happening.  THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY PROBLEM.  The car takes off out of control unexpectedly, and the brakes won't stop the force forward.  PLEASE help me, I cannot stress enough the danger this car puts me and others in, and it is my only vehicle.  The dealer is trying but corporate is being difficult and are not interested in compromise.  The DPF, emissions issues they have had, have nothing to do with the acceleration and they just refuse to move forward or discuss anything else.

Visibility was impaired when defroster failed to clear windshield and heater was not working on 12/16/2022. I took vehicle to Hayward Volkswagen on 04/04/2023 and was told heater core needs to be replaced.  This is a known problem  to Volkswagen; there's a warranty recall on the 2014 Passatt with the same heater core. I have found numerous complaints on line with the same Jetta heater complaint. The 2014 Jetta i own has approximately 88,000 miles, mechanically sound car which i am unable to drive in winter months.  Feeling frustrated, I did contact VW "helpline" on 01/05/2024, they were no help, not even to negotiate price.
The contact owns a 2014 Volkswagen Jetta. The contact stated while driving approximately 30 MPH and depressing on the horn, the horn failed to make a sound. The contact stated that the air bag, ABS, and Electronic Steering Control (ESC) warning lights were illuminated. The contact took the vehicle to an independent mechanic and was informed that the clockspring needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The contact took the vehicle to the local dealer, where it was diagnosed with needing the horn to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer had not been informed of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 100,000.
Got the Jetta in 2017 with 70,000 miles on it. It ran good in the beginning but gradually the engine light and the EPC light came on. It began to idle rough and die in the middle of driving it. With my child in the car! We took it to the dealership and they said nothing was wrong with it except it needed an update. Well that didn't help, eventually the whole engine shut down in the middle of driving it, luckily I was right by my house so I was able to get it started again and parked in the garage for a couple months until we could get it into the dealership. They looked at it and said it was an oil consumption problem with no leak and we need a new engine. They wanted to charge us 14 grand for a new engine! Appearently this is a common problem for Jettas. I'm contacting Volkswagen also.
TRANSMISSION OIL COOLER LEAKING TRANSMISSION OIL. TOOK TO VOLKSWAGEN DEALERSHIP AND THEY ATTEMPTED REPAIR AND I LEFT IN THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS DRIVING AND THE CAR START SMOKING AND LEAKING OIL ALL OVER THE ROAD.
THE HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP DISINTEGRATED WHEN IT WAS SITTING SO LONG IN STORAGE. DUE TO THE EDITIONS RECALL VW HAD. THERE FOR THE CAR WILL LOOSE POWER AND COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. UNEXPECTEDLY.   THE CAR WAS DRIVING ON A CITY STREET WHEN THIS HAPPENED.

PERFECTLY MAINTAINED 2014 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA WITH 65K MILES ON IT "TIMING CHAINS ARE STRETCHED AND CAMSHAFT ADJUSTMENTS VALUES ARE OUTSIDE OF SPECIFICATIONS MEANING THE CAMSHAFT HAS FAILED". THERE IS ALSO AN ISSUE WITH THE TENSIONER.     THE VEHICLE HAS STALLED, FELT AS IF IT WAS GOING TO BUCK FORWARD WHEN STOPPED AT A LIGHT, RPM IS INCONSISTENT WITH SPEED.     THIS ISSUE WAS ALREADY ADDRESS IN A CLASS ACTION FOR REGULAR VW JETTA'S. MY VECHILE MEETS ALL OF THE CRITERIA WHEN IT COMES TO MILEAGE, THE YEAR, AND MAINTENANCE DONE. HOWEVER, IT'S A JETTA 2.0.
KEY GETS STUCK IN IGNITION AND I CANNOT TURN OFF THE ENGINE.
TAKATA RECALL. DRIVING ON HIGHWAY TRYING TO SPEED UP AND EPC LIGHT CAME ON ENGINE CHECK LIGHT CAME ON AND STARTED FLASHING AND SKID LIGHT CAME ON. CAR BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN, SEEM LIKE SHUT OFF AND I HAD TO PULL OVER ON THE SIDE OF THE FREEWAY.

AFTER THE SOFTWARE UPGRADE/SERVICE IN DEC 2018, THE DOORS UNLOCK WHILE WE ARE DRIVING ON THE STREET OR THE HIGHWAY.  EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.  ERIC THE SERVICE MANAGER AT WINN VOLKSWAGEN IN NEWARK CALIFORNIA DEALER REFUSES TO NOTIFY VW OF THE ISSUE AND ASKED US TO NOTIFY VW WHICH I DID.
THE VEHICLE WILL RANDOMLY SHUT OFF WHILE DRIVING OR PARKED. IT HAS HAPPENED IN TRAFFIC AND OCCURS MOST OFTEN WHEN DECELERATING, IDLING, OR PARKED. OBVIOUSLY, WITH THE ENGINE OFF, POWER STEERING AND BRAKES AREN'T AVAILABLE.

TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE EPC WARNING INDICATOR ILLUMINATED. SHORTLY AFTER, THERE WAS A DRASTIC REDUCTION IN SPEED EACH TIME THE FAILURE OCCURRED. THE VEHICLE WAS UNABLE TO BE DRIVEN DUE TO THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER AND THEY REPLACED AN INTERNAL PART WITHIN THE TURBO ENGINE ASSEMBLY. TWO WEEKS LATER, THE INDICATOR ILLUMINATED AGAIN AND THERE WAS A DRASTIC REDUCTION IN SPEED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED BACK TO THE DEALER FOR FURTHER INSPECTION. THE DEALER WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE A SOLUTION. THE MANUFACTURER WAS TO ESCALATE THE CONCERN AND RESPOND BACK TO THE CONTACT TO DETERMINE A REPAIR REMEDY. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 4,000.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. WHILE OPERATING THE VEHICLE, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ILLUMINATED. THE CONTACT INDICATED THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER WHO PERFORMED SERVICE TO REMEDY THE FAILURE, BUT IT CONTINUED. NO FURTHER INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 11,000.
I PURCHASED MY CAR IN MID-FEB 2014 AND IT PERFORMED FLAWLESSLY THE WINTER OF 2014.    I STARTED MY CAR ON MONDAY JAN 5 (OAT +5F) LET IT IDLE FOR A MINUTE AND DROVE 35 MI TO WORK ON THE HIGHWAY (RPM >2500), I DON'T HAVE A TEMP GAUGE, BUT MY CAR DID NOT SEEM TO WARM UP LIKE NORMAL. (USUALLY ITS WARM AFTER ABOUT 3 MI, AND HOT AFTER 10-15).     AFTER WORK (+8HRS LATER) I STARTED MY CAR (OAT +15F), LETTING IT IDLE FOR A MINUTE THEN DROVE OUT OF THE PARKING GARAGE (~100') AND MY CAR LOST POWER, AND HAD A FLASHING GLOW PLUG LIGHT, I BELIEVE THIS WAS LIMP MODE. I PULLED INTO A PARKING LOT, LET MY CAR IDLE FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THERE WAS NO CHANGE. I SHUT THE CAR OFF, WAITED A MINUTE OR TWO, AND RESTARTED THE ENGINE, APPEARED TO RUN FINE AND I CONTINUED MY DRIVE HOME. I PULLED MY VAGCOM CODES AND SAW THAT P0299, LOW BOOST PRESSURE, I ATTEMPTED TO GET MY CAR INTO THE DEALER, BUT THEY WERE TOO BUSY. I DID NOT DRIVE MY CAR TUESDAY, BUT DROVE IT TO AND FROM WORK WEDNESDAY WITHOUT A PROBLEM. ON THURSDAY MORNING I STARTED MY CAR (-5F), IT IDLED FOR LESS THAN A MINUTE AND THEN DIED. IT CONTINUED TO TURN OVER, BUT WOULD NOT START. I PULLED THE CODES AGAIN (DID NOT CLEAR THEM FROM EARLIER IN THE WEEK) AND SAW THAT I HAD A NEW FAULT P0087, LOW FUEL PRESSURE.    I HAD MY CAR TOWED TO THE DEALER (VW ROADSIDE IS SLOW, BUT FREE) AND DID NOT HEAR ANYTHING FROM THE DEALER UNTIL FRIDAY AFTERNOON. I WAS TOLD THAT ICE WAS DISCOVERED IN MY INTERCOOLER AND THAT IT HAD BEEN REPLACED AND THE COLD WEATHER KIT WAS INSTALLED.   *TR
VEHICLE IS SHUTTING DOWN DURING OPERATION. THREE TIMES NOW, THE CAR HAS SHUT OFF WHILE SITTING AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT. THE CAR WILL JUST STALL OUT. ODDLY, IT RESTARTS WITH EASE WHEN PLACED BACK IN PARK. IT WILL SOMETIMES SHUTTER WHILE ACCELERATING FROM A STOP, AS IF IT IS GOING TO STALL. IT HAS A GAS ENGINE, WITH AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION. DEALER RECENTLY ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM BY REPLACING A RELAY TO THE FUEL PUMP. UNFORTUNATELY,  THE PROBLEM REMAINS. YESTERDAY, IT STALLED WHILE DRIVING ALONG A SIDE STREET. CAR IS BACK AT THE DEALERS.  *TR
Bottom line: brakes failed to stop car on decline slope.   Situation: driver depressed brake and hit start button. With brakes still depressed the driver put the car into gear. However, the gear jolted and the car began rolling forward. Driver attempted to press the brakes without any response. The car rolled to a stop without any control over braking or accelerating. Once stopped the driver put the car back into park and pressed the start button. The car then ignited and started. After starting, pressure came back into the brake pedal and the engine revved when the accelerator was pressed. No issues were detected after the car started. Available for inspection upon request.  Safety: the safety of the driver and surrounding persons was endangered due to the vehicle’s inability to stop when the brakes are depressed.  Reproduction: the problem has not been reproduced by a dealer, however a second Reddit user describes a similar situation happening in their Jetta.  Inspection: part has not been inspected since the incident but was regularly checked before.  Warning: no warning lights were on before the event occurred. Car seemed to operate normally.
I purchased a 2015 Volkswagen Jetta from North Coast Auto Mall on March 19, 2023 and the following day several issues went wrong with the vehicle like: The car reeked of gasoline, oil and engine lights came on, driver side head light blew out. Also, I was told that the car had an inspection, come to find out they didn't do an inspection by North Coast Service manager, so they lied. Also, the reason for the gasoline smell is because the vehicle needs a fuel rack, oil pan, oil pressure switch, and a new headlight. Too many things are going wrong with this car in such a short period of time. It took North Coast two weeks to take my vehicle and they didn't want to give me a loaner car. Also, they have had my vehicle since March 28, 2023 and refuse to disclose of the reconditioning shop of my vehicle. They moved my car from Volkswagen Of Streetsboro to North Coast to another undisclosed location that they won't disclose. Lastly, the car was unsafe for me and my special needs son. He couldn't even ride in my car due to the bad gasoline fumes and I had to ride with the windows down, and come to find out the car could have caught on fire or exploded.
Clockspring on my Jetta broke which disabled horn and cruise control functions.  The safety issue is the horn.  The clockspring should not fail on any car with barely 50k operating miles on it.  The unit has not yet been replaced.  The dashboard shows an airbag warning light.  No prior symptoms.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE EMITTED A STRONG FUEL ODOR OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE NEARBY THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE FUEL ODOR WAS ALSO PRESENT ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT TAKEN TO BE DIAGNOSED NOR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS CONTACTED AND THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED THAT THE VIN WAS NOT INCLUDED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 15V028000 (FUEL SYSTEM, GASOLINE). THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 80,000.

IGNITION SWITCH WOULD NOT TURN OFF, COULD NOT TURN OFF ENGINE.
I PARKED AT THE STORE AND THE KEY GOT STUCK IN THE IGNITION WHILE THE CAR IS RUNNING PREVENTING ME FROM TURNING THE CAR ENGINE OFF . WHEN HE KEY GETS STUCK IN THE IGNITION SWITCH WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING PREVENTING YOU FROM TURNING THE CAR ENGINE OFF. THEREFORE YOU CAN'T LEAVE YOUR CAR TO GO IN THE HOUSE , STORE OR EVEN TO THE BATHROOM. THIS WILL ALLOWS YOUR CAR TO BE ATTRACTIVE TO CAR THEIVES WHEN YOU MUST LEAVE TO GET HELP. NEEDS A RECALL ASAP.
ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2017 I HAD PARKED MY CAR FOR ABOUT 4 HOURS ON A VERY HOT DAY (OVER 90 DEGREES FARENHEIT) AND I ENTERED THE CAR, TURNED ON THE AIR CONDITIONING ON FULL COOL AND BEGAN TO DRIVE.  APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES LATER, WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, THE PASSENGER SIDE FRONT DOOR WINDOW ":EXPLODED" OUT SENDING GLASS OUTSIDE THE CAR INTO THE LANE NEXT TO ME AND ONTO THE ROADWAY.  THE NOISE OF THE EXPLOSION WAS VERY LOUD AND STARTLED ME.  THE GLASS THAT REMAINED AROUND THE EDGES OF THE BROKEN WINDOW FELL INTO THE CAR IN THE PASSENGER AREA BUT MOST HAD BEEN BLOWN OUT IN THE "EXPLOSION.".  THE GLASS THAT BLEW OUT SCRATCHED THE CAR PAINT UNDERNEATH AND BEHIND THE DOOR ON THE OUTSIDE.  I YAKT EXTREMELY GOOD CARE OF MY CARS AND THE WINDOW, PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION, WAS COMPLETELY INTACT WITH NO DAMAGES OR SCRATCHES ON THE WINDOW.  HAD ANYONE BEEN NEXT TO ME IN ANOTHER AUTO WITH THE WINDOW OPEN, OR IF I HAD BEEN STATIOANARY AND A PEDESTRIAN  WAS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW, I AM CERTAIN THEY WOULD HAVE SUSTAINED INJURIES.  WHILE THE FORCE OF THE BLAST WAS OUTWARD, I BELEIVE ANYONE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT WOULD HAVE LIKEWISE SUSTAINED INJURY, CERTAINLY TO THE EYES AS MINUTE GLASS PARTICLES  WERE BLOWN ABOUT THE CAR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.  IN MY OPINION, THE GLASS WAS EITHER MANUFACTURED IN A FAULTY MANNER THAT DID NOT ALLOW FOR THE TEMPERATURE VARIANCES OR INSTALLED AT MANUFACTURE OF THE VEHICLE IN A MANNER THE DID NOT ALLOW EXPANSION AND/OR CONTRACTION OF THE GLASS CAUSED BY TEMPERATURE VARIANCES.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. WHILE AT A RED LIGHT, THE ENGINE SUDDENLY REVVED AND THE BRAKES FAILED TO STOP THE VEHICLE FROM MOVING, THE VEHICLE ACCELERATED AND CRASHED INTO THE PRECEDING VEHICLE, WHICH THEN CRASHED INTO A THIRD VEHICLE. THERE WERE NO WARNING INDICATORS ILLUMINATED. THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. THERE WERE NO INJURIES AND A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO A LOCAL DEALER. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 14,907. THE VIN WAS NOT PROVIDED.
VW DEALER AND MECHANIC ADMITS TO DRIVING MY CAR AND VERIFYING IN PERSON WHILE DRIVING THAT MY CAR TIRES ARE SHAKING DUE TO THE SUSPENSION OF THE CAR AND I SHOULD PUT LUGGAGE IN THE TRUNK TO HELP SMOOTH THE RIDE OR GO WITH A LARGER WHEEL SIZE..  I FEEL VERY UNSAFE WITH FAMILY IN MY CAR. ELECTRICAL ISSUE IS A FUSE KEEPS BURNING OUT DUE TO AN IMPROPER GROUND FROM BOTH POWER PLUGS FRONT AND BACK SEAT.  WHILE DRIVING THE PASSENGER DOOR OPENED BY ITSELF WHILE BOTH HANDS WERE ON THE STEERING WHEEL.
Had an accident in Dec where passenger side was hit in the center. The center rail that connects 2 doors was hit so airbags deployed due to roof being pushed in by center bar.  But only back airbag had a little air. Front airbag was flat.  I took it to the dealer and a month later they are telling me that is normal but I took the picture right after the accident and there is no air in front passenger bag. I told them my child is lucky to be alive.  But i know its dangerous if other people are travelling in the same type car as mine.  Also bag in the back has a lot of air and no fold creases because it was filled with air.  Front airbag looks like it was folded and just fell out and since it has no air all the creases where it folded in roof are still there.
My car went into limp mode and smelled heavily of gas I went to a garage to have it checked out and they told me there diagnostic said it was fuel rail.
The contact owns a 2016 Volkswagen Jetta. The contact stated while starting the vehicle, there was an abnormal chemical odor entering the cabin of the vehicle. There was no warning light illuminated. The contact took the vehicle to the local dealer however, failure was undetermined. The contact was informed that the air conditioning assembly needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was informed of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 36,000.
EVER SINCE I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE ONE YEAR AGO, I NOTICED THAT MY CAR HAS TROUBLE STARTING. IT IS A PUSH-TO-START CAR, AND SOMETIMES IT CUTS OFF AND I HAVE TO PUSH THE BUTTON TO HAVE IT RESTART. IT HAPPENS DURING ALL TYPES OF WEATHER, AND I'VE HAD THE BATTER TESTED AT THE DEALERSHIP AND IT WAS IN GOOD STANDING, AND THEY COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT. I'VE ALSO HAD TO REPLACE THE TIRES MULTIPLE TIMES OVER THIS LAST ONE YEAR OF HAVING THE CAR. THE FIRST TIME I HAD TO DO THAT WAS LITERALLY WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF BUYING THE CAR. FURTHERMORE, THE RANGE FEATURE THAT GIVES YOU AN AUTOMATIC READING OF THE GAS GAUGE IS INACCURATE. WHEN I FILL UP THE TANK IF SOMETIMES READS OVER 300 MILES, AND THEN SOMETIMES IT READS OVER 400; AND THEN WHEN THE GAS IS LOW AND NEARING EMPTY, IT NOTIFIES ME AT 30 MILES LEFT TILL EMPTY BUT THEN RAPIDLY DROPS TO 15 OR LESS BY INCREMENTS OF 5.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2016 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. WHILE THE CONTACT'S DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING 30 MPH, MULTIPLE WARNING INDICATORS ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO CAPITAL VOLKSWAGEN (LOCATED AT 3963 W TENNESSEE ST, TALLAHASSEE, FL 32304, (850) 692-5609) WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE REAR PASSENGER SENSOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 34,000. THE VIN WAS NOT AVAILABLE.
I WAS TRAVELING AT 40 MPH THROUGH A CITY STREET INTERSECTION. MY CAR WAS T-BONED ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE WITH SUCH FORCE THAT MY CAR WAS SPUN AROUND ALMOST 180 DEGREES. 80% OF THE IMPACT WAS ON THE DRIVER'S REAR DOOR, 20% ON THE DRIVER'S DOOR. THE SIDE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY, THIS INCLUDED A CAR EQUIPPED WITH SIDE/CURTAIN AIRBAGS. I HAD ISSUES PREVIOUSLY WITH THE WINDOWS PROPERLY WORKING AND HAD ALL COMPONENTS MINUS THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM REPLACED ON THE DRIVER'S DOOR AND A PASSENGER DOOR. THERE WERE A FEW OTHER ODDITIES AT TIMES WITH THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM OF THE JETTA. CONSIDERING THE FORCE OF THE IMPACT I SUSPECT AN ELECTRICAL GLITCH WITH THE SENSORS OR SOME OTHER PROBLEM THAT PREVENTED THE AIRBAGS FROM DEPLOYING. THE DAMAGE WAS EXTENSIVE ENOUGH THAT THE CAR WAS TOTALED.
WHILE DRIVING THE CAR ON CITY STREETS AND ON THE HIGHWAY AT 65 MPH THE CAR SUDDENLY BECOMES UNRESPONSIVE AND SLOWS TO A STOP.  THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKS AND THE ACCELERATOR DOES NOT WORK.  THE CAR WILL NOT IMMEDIATELY RESTART.  IF THE CAR IS TURNED OFF AND ALLOWED TO SIT FOR 10-15 MINUTES IT WILL USUALLY RESTART.  THIS HAS HAPPENED AT LEAST THREE TIMES.
JETTA ENGINE QUIT RUNNING WITH NO NOTICE IN BUSY HIGHWAY.  CAR HAD TO BE TOWED TO DEALER. CAR WAS NOT REPAIRED FOR THREE WEEKS.  THEY CITED LACK OF FUEL SYSTEM MANAGEMENT COMPUTER MODULE.  IT WOULD TAKE 5-7 BUSINESS DAYS TO GET.  FUEL COMPUTER MODULE AND FUEL PUMP WERE REPLACED.  HAVE NO CONFIDENCE IN CAR SAFETY.  VW WILL NOT REPLACE PER MY REQUEST. MY WIFE IS FEARFUL OF DRIVING CAR SINCE SHE WAS TRAUMATIZED.
The contact owns 2017 Volkswagen Jetta. The contact stated that while the vehicle was parked, the vehicle failed to turn off while turning the key to the off position in the ignition switch. There was no warning light illuminated. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic and a dealer and was diagnosed, and it was determined that the cylinders in the engine was rusted. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The failure mileage was 89,000.
Clockspring in steering wheel has failed, rendering driver airbag non-operational. Should vehicle be involved in a collision, driver airbag will not engage. Horn and steering wheel buttons are also non-operational
Dealer does not have parts to fix recall.  Received fuel rail recall notice in March.  It is late May and have called dealer multiple times with same response.  Recall is for fuel rail that may leak.
THIS 2017 JETTA HAD A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF GASOLINE SPRAYING FROM THE FUEL RAIL WHICH WAS CAUSED BY POORLY INSTALLED FUEL RAIL BOLTS.  THE CAR WAS TOWED TO A CERTIFIED VW DEALERSHIP ON NOV 11TH FOR REPAIR OF THIS DOCUMENTED MANUFACTURER DEFECT.  THE CAR REMAINS IN THE POSSESSION OF BILLING MONTANA VOLKSWAGEN WITH NO RESOLUTION TO THE OPEN SAFETY RECALL.  IT IS NOW DECEMBER 28TH, 2020.  THE CAR HAS BEEN IN VW HANDS FOR 46 DAYS.  I WAS TOLD THAT IT COULD TAKE UP TO SIX MORE MONTHS TO FIGURE OUT THE "PRESCRIBED FIX".
WHILE DRIVING THE MY DRIVER SIDE WINDOW FELL OF TRACK AND FELL DOWN TOWARDS THE DOOR PANEL. IT CAUSED DEBRIS TO FALL INTO MY CAR ALMOST CAUSING ME TO. CRASH. I LOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME. BACK IN 2018 THE DRIVER SIDE WINDOW FELL OF TRACK WHILE WAS DRIVING ALMOST CAUSING ME TO CRASH. IT FELT AS IF I WAS STRUCK BY LIGHTING. IT WAS A VERY SCARY MOMENT.

2017 VW JETTA 1.4L GAS ENGINE    JOLTS WHEN PRESSING OR DEPRESSING ACCELERATION PEDAL UNDER 20MI/H. BRAKES TO A SUDDEN STOP (NOT SMOOTH) WHEN BRINGING CAR TO A COMPLETE STOP.
Malfunction ignition switch, and ignition cylinder, 50,000 miles on car. Took it to the dealer for diagnosis. No warning lamps or lights showed. My car just stopped allowing my key to come out of the ignition to turn the car off. I have to struggle to get it out of the ignition for 10-20 mins every time I take my key out. My car could potentially not turn on or off when the pieces go out completely
I went to leave my workplace and got into my car with a message of “Only Exit Vehicle in a P Position. Please Service Vehicle”. I turned off my vehicle and restarted it and the message went away  The next morning I got in my vehicle and the same message came back. Leaving my workplace it shut itself off again  I found that this year and model has been affected by a recall for that same issue before, but my VIN was not included in that recall order
The contact owns a 2019 Volkswagen Jetta. The contact stated that while driving at 30 MPH on a rainy day, the windows were foggy and the contact was not able to view the roadway.   The contact attempted to veer to the left when the vehicle slid until it impacted a concrete barrier. The driver's front side and the front and back bumper were impacted, and the tire was torn. No warning lights illuminated. The contact called 911, and a police officer was dispatched to prevent other vehicles from hitting the contact. The police officer helped the contact push the vehicle. No injuries were sustained. A police report was not filed. The vehicle was taken to the dealer, where it was diagnosed and an alignment was performed, the axle was repaired, a new windshield was placed, and a tire was replaced. The vehicle was repaired. The air bags did not deploy. The vehicle was not destroyed. The vehicle continued to experience failures with the windshield, and the fuel pump was also experiencing a failure. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure, and a report was submitted. The failure mileage was 17,000.
My starter and gear shift have been malfunctioning, the starter barely turns over and the gearshift sends out a warning to only exit the vehicle in ‘P’ position…
I keep getting a message on my dash saying ONLY EXIT VEHICLE IN “P” Position. Please Service Vehicle.
Starter system faulty message. Car shuts off when it gets warm. Shut down while driving on interstate.
The contact owns a 2019 Volkswagen Jetta. The contact received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 23V604000 (Electrical System) however, the part to do the recall repair was unavailable. The contact stated that the manufacturer had exceeded a reasonable amount of time for the recall repair. The manufacturer was not made aware of the issue. The contact had not experienced a failure. VIN tool confirms parts not available.
Ignition gets very hot, when I put the key in the ignition, it also gets very hot, car will run for a minute or so and then lose power. The car shut off could be very dangerous if going down the road.  Warning to check starter system came on.
Hot day (~107f), car started fine but after a mile of driving ALL ELECTRICAL systems appeared to STOP with the following error: "Starter System Faulty. Please Service Vehicle."  The engine kept going, and the car was driven home (with no signals, speedo, air conditioning, lights etc.) If this had happened in a more demanding situation (e.g. weather, night or traffic) there could have been an accident.  There are numerous threads online about this happening to 2019 Jettas in hot weather, and the ignition switch being blamed. I recreated the issue in the heat of the day, but the car worked fine later on when the day cooled down.
When vehicle is at a stop and then goes to accelerate, between 25 and 30MPH there is a low growl from the engine area and a lag in acceleration and a drop in power, which has proved dangerous when trying to avoid a collision when someone ran a stop sign and I had to try and hurry through to avoid being hit. Sometimes if foot is not on accelerator letting the vehicle coast and then reapplied with vehicle going a decent speed there is also a jumping/jerking motion. Also, the blind spot censor illuminates when nothing is present.
I was in a head on collision where the other person crossed the line and two empty lanes to hit me head on. This WAS in may 2021. Not one single warning was used by forward collision sensors. No emergency braking was applied. My airbags were not deployed and this man hit me doing at least 35 miles an hour and also I was forward moving even though I was applying my brakes.  The car was totaled. Yet not a single warning sound or light or indicator once went off. I also paid extra for the Volkswagen carnet services. Never once did they come over the speaker to ask if I was ok. To tell me I had been in an accident or ask if I needed them to send help. In essence these services failed me completely. I do not understand why I was not included in any of the airbag recalls or settlement information I have heard about.  All of the Extra features and functions I paid all the extra money to have - every single one failed me when I needed it. This vehicle left me without the protections it promised.
The heating/air conditioner has failed twice within one year preventing defrost during incliment weather especially rain and frost.
The contact's wife owns a 2019 Volkswagen Jetta. The contact's wife started noticing that the passenger’s side headlight had started to dim while driving. His wife took the vehicle to a dealer where she was informed that the passenger’s side headlamp needed to be replaced. Upon investigation, the contact discovered NHTSA Campaign Number: 18V671000 (Exterior Lighting) which he linked to the failure; however, the dealer had informed him that the vehicle was not included in the recall. The manufacturer had yet to be notified of the failure. The vehicle had yet to be repaired. The failure mileage was unknown.
THE BRAKES AFTER SITTING NO MATTER LENGTH MAKE HORRIBLE NOISE, AND ARE VERY STIFF. IT CAN BE FIVE MINUTES OR OVER NIGHT. THIS IS NOT SAFE. I TOLD THE DEALER WITHIN DAYS OF PURCHASING.
2 SECOND DELAY FOR TRANSMISSION TO DOWNSHIFT  WHEN PASSING CARS.  DANGEROUS WHEN PASSING CARS ON 2 LANE HIGHWAY DUE TO LACK OF POWER.  .
I HAVE A 2019 VW JETTA GLI BOUGHT NEW FROM VW DEALER.  WHEN YOU FIRST START THE CAR IN THE MORNING OR AFTER ITS BEEN SITTING, BASICALLY COLD, IT IDLES VERY ROUGH.  THE WHOLE CAR VIBRATES AND SHAKES.  AFTER THE CAR WARMS UP THIS GOES AWAY.  THE RIDE OF THE CAR FEELS LIKE THERE IS NO SUSPENSION.  YOU FEEL EVERY BUMP IN THE ROAD.  I HAVE NEVER GOTTEN MOTION SICK FROM A VEHICLE WHILE DRIVING.  THIS CAR GIVES ME MOTION SICKNESS EVERY TIME I DRIVE IT.  I HAVE HAD OTHERS DRIVE THE CAR AND REPORT THE SAY THING.  I HAVE HAD PASSENGERS IN THE CAR AND THEY CAN'T BELIEVE HOW HARD THE RIDE IS.  I HAVE TRIED ALL THE MODES ECO, NORMAL, SPORT AND THEY ALL HAVE A HORRIBLE RIDE QUALITY.    THE WORST THING IS I WAS DRIVING THE CAR HOME AFTER WORK AND WHILE SITTING AT A RED LIGHT THE A/C STOPPED BLOWING COLD AIR.  AFTER COMING OFF THE RED LIGHT I STARTED SMELLING FUEL COMING FROM THE A/C SYSTEM.  THE A/C SYSTEM WAS ON MAX A/C WITH THE RECIRC ON, SO WAS NOT ON FRESH AIR.  PULLED OVER, OPENED THE HOOD AND SAW FIRE COMING FROM BETWEEN THE ENGINE AND FIREWALL ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.  I DROPPED THE HOOD AND THE FIRE BALL SHOT OUT THE SIDE PASSENGER SIDE RIGHT BEHIND THE PASSENGER FRONT TIRE.  THE SIDE AND UNDER CARRIAGE OF THE CAR WAS ON FIRE AND IS BURNT UP.  I CONTACTED THE DEALER THEY SAID TO DRIVE IT IN AND THEY WILL TAKE A LOOK AT IT. DRIVE IT IN???? AFTER IT WAS ON FIRE???  *TR
THE VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION, MIDDLE LANE ON MAIN ROAD, 30 MPH. SUDDENLY THE PASSENGER BACK WINDOW SHATTERED FOR NO APPARENT REASON AND THE GLASS FELL AND BLEW INSIDE THE CAR.
I HAVE A MANUAL TRANSMISSION 2019 JETTA GLI.  BECAUSE I HAVE A MANUAL TRANSMISSION, I ENGAGE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE WHENEVER I PARK.  IF THE EMERGENCY BRAKE IS ON FOR A PERIOD OF 3 OR MORE HOURS, IT WILL NOT DISENGAGE WHEN I ATTEMPT TO DO SO WITH THE ELECTRONIC BUTTON.  THE ELECTRONIC BUTTON SHOWS IT IS OFF, BUT THE BRAKES ARE STILL ENGAGED.  I HAVE TO TRY TO MOVE THE VEHICLE IN ORDER TO "BREAK" THE PADS AWAY.  IT PRODUCES A VERY VIOLENT "BOOM" FROM THE BRAKES AS THEY PULL AWAY.      THE DEALER SAYS THIS IS "NORMAL" BECAUSE CONDENSATION STICKS THE PADS TO THE CALIPERS (OR WHATEVER, I DON'T KNOW THE TERMS), BUT IT SEEMS VERY VIOLENT TO ME AND FEELS LIKE THE BRAKES ARE BEING COMPROMISED EVERY TIME I USE MY EMERGENCY BRAKE.    THE DEALER WILL DO NOTHING ABOUT THIS.
2019 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. CONSUMER WRITES IN REGARDS TO GRINDING NOISE WHILE CHANGING GEARS. *LD    THE CONSUMER STATED THE VEHICLE WAS TAKING TO THE DEALER WHO WAS ADVISED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS OPERATING AS DESIGNED. THE CONSUMER GOT A SECOND OPINION, WHO ADVISED THERE MAY BE A TRANSMISSION ISSUE.  *JS
THE CAR IS MAKING A GROWLING SOUND WHEN GOING LOW RATE SPEEDS. TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG. APPARENTLY THIS IS AN ISSUE WITH THE CAR READING ALL THE COMPLAINTS.
THE SAME DAY I DROVE THE VEHICLE OFF THE DEALER'S LOT, IT SHUT-OFF ON ME THREE TIMES; ONCE ON THE NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE AND TWICE AT A STOP LIGHT. THE FIRST TIME AT THE STOP LIGHT, I WAS WAITING FOR THE LIGHT TO TURN GREEN. THE SECOND WAS COMING TO A STOP. FURTHER, I WAS UNAWARE THE VEHICLE HAD SHUT-OFF UNTIL I TOOK MY FOOT OF THE BRAKE AND PLACED IT ON THE ACCELERATOR. IT SHUT-OFF A FOURTH TIME THE FOLLOWING WEEKEND WHILE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FOUR WAY INTERSECTION. EACH TIME, THE INFO CENTER IN THE DASHBOARD STATED, "PLACE THE GEAR SHIFT IN PARK AND MANUALLY START THE VEHICLE."
THE ENGINE OF MY NEW 2019 JETTA GLI 6MT SOMETIMES STALLS WHEN COMING TO A STOP. THE CLUTCH PEDAL IS FULLY DEPRESSED (DISENGAGED), WITH THE STICK EITHER IN 1ST OR NEUTRAL. THIS HAPPENED 3 OR 4 TIMES YESTERDAY, AUG 1 2019, AFTER DRIVING WITH MEDIUM SPEEDS ON HILLY ROADS FOR 30-45 MINUTES. THE VEHICLE HAS AROUND 350 MILES ON IT.
MY MANUAL TRANSMISSION-EQUIPPED 2019 JETTA GLI (2.0T) STALLS AT SLOW SPEEDS AND AT STOP LIGHTS DESPITE THE CLUTCH PEDAL FULLY ENGAGED ("TO THE FLOOR") OR THE VEHICLE COASTING IN NEUTRAL. I HAVE HAD THE CAR FOR THREE DAYS AND IN TWO OF THOSE DAYS, THE VEHICLE HAS STALLED WHILE DRIVING THROUGH CITY STREETS AND AT STOP LIGHTS. THE FIRST OCCURRENCE HAPPEN AT APPROXIMATELY 100 MILES ON THE ODOMETER, WITH THE SECOND AT AROUND 120 MILES. THE VEHICLE SHOWED NO PREEMPTIVE SIGNS OF A STALL, AND NECESSITATED A FULL RE-IGNTIION OF THE ENGINE IN ORDER TO PROCEED OUT OF TRAFFIC. A QUICK SEARCH OF "2019 JETTA GLI/GTI STALLING ISSUE" RETURNS A LARGE LIST OF IDENTICAL OCCURRENCES WITH MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS IN 2019-BUILT ENGINES/DRIVETRAINS.
I JUST PURCHASED A 2019 JETTA R LINE AND SINCE DAY ONE I HAVE A GRINDING NOISE COMING FROM THE TRANSFER CASE OR THE TRANSMISSION. IT'S ALWAYS THERE AT AROUND 50KM/PER HOUR FOR ABOUT 2 SEC. LIKE MANY OTHERS SAID IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT FOR ME. I HOPE VW WILL TAKE ACTION AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. ON TOP OF THAT I LOST ALL MY RADIO PRESETS AND THE SCREEN HAS STARTED TO FREEZE. I ALSO NOTICE A KNOCKING SOUND IN THE REAR SUSPENSION OVER NORMAL BUMPS.
THE CAR SHUT OFF, I LOST CONTROL OF THE POWER STEERING AND THE BREAKS FAILED TO STOP AFTER THE COMPUTER SHUT THE CAR OFF.  NOW THEY CALM THE SHIFTER IS DEFECTIVE AND NEEDS REPLACED AFTER THERE COMPUTER DIAGNOSTIC CODES FAILED TO DETECT THE PROBLEM THE FIRST 2 TIMES AND A TEST DRIVE WOULD HAVE TOLD THEM THEIR WAS A PROBLEM BUT THEY REFUSED TO DO A TEST DRIVE AND RELIED AND FAULTY COMPUTER INPUT.    THIS SERIOUS MALFUNCTION COULD HAVE RESULTED IN MY INJURY OR DEATH OR INJURY AND DEATH TO ANOTHER PARTY.   THE DEFECTIVE SHIFTER HAS CAUSED INJURY TO MY RIGHT KNEE AND TENDONS.   I WAS IN PARK, A PERSON ENTERED THE CAR.  I PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE AND THE CAR SHUT OFF ROLLED DOWN THE HILL UNTIL IT STOPPED BY ROLLING IN REVERSE UP A HILL BEHIND ME.   THE PERSON REFUSED TO BE IN MY CAR AS THE DANGER WAS OBVIOUS TO HER.  THE ONLY REASON THE CAR STOPPED WAS BECAUSE OF THE HILL.  I LOST CONTROL OF THE BRAKES AND POWER STEERING AS THE CAR WAS SHUT OFF.  ANY CHILD OR ELDERLY PERSON BEHIND ME WOULD HAVE SUFFER SERIOUS INJURY.  THE DEALERSHIP I PURCHASED THE CAR FROM IS REFUSING TO WRITE ANY OF THIS INFORMATION DOWN.
I PURCHASED THIS CAR IN EARLY MAY 2018.  EARLY ON, I EXPERIENCED INCREASING RPM WHEN THE GAS WAS RELEASED AND THE CLUTCH ENGAGED. A SLIGHT BURNING SMELL COULD BE DETECTED FROM THE CLUTCH SOME OF THE TIME. HOWEVER, ON 3 OCCASIONS, THIS MALFUNCTION WAS EXTRAORDINARY, WHERE THE ENGINE RPM SOARED VERY HIGH AND THE CLUTCH DID NOT SEEM TO FULLY DISENGAGE. ON ALL THREE INCIDENTS, THE BURNING SMELL WAS SIGNIFICANT.   WITH ONLY 5800 MILES, THE DEALERSHIP DISCOVERED THAT THE CLUTCH WAS WORN TO THE RIVETS.   VW OF AMERICA'S RESPONSE; 'OPERATOR ERROR' ' NOT A WARRANTY CONCERN.  POINT OF REFERENCE:  I HAVE OWNED / OPERATED 8 CARS WITH MANUAL TRANSMISSION OVER THE PAST 43 YEARS FOR A TOTAL OF OVER 700,000 MILES OF DRIVING.  I HAVE NEVER NEEDED TO SERVICE A CLUTCH UNDER 100,000 MILES OF SERVICE.  THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT WAS NOT ABLE TO REPLICATE THIS MALFUNCTION, AS IT ONLY OCCURRED A FEW TIMES EACH MONTH.  VW OF AMERICA AGREES IT IS VERY UNUSUAL TO HAVE A CLUTCH WEAR SO QUICKLY, BUT ALSO BELIEVES IT IS DUE TO THE WAY I DRIVE THE CAR AND NOT COVERED BY THEIR WARRANTY.  90% OF MY DRIVING IS ON A 30 MILE (INTERSTATE) SEGMENT BETWEEN MY HOME AND O'HARE AIRPORT (I AM AN AIRLINE PILOT).  I CANNOT IMAGINE THE DELIBERATE EFFORT IT WOULD TAKE, OR THE PAIN IN SITTING THROUGH THE KIND OF 'NORMAL' CLUTCH ACTION IT WOULD REQUIRE TO WEAR MY CLUTCH DOWN TO NOTHING IN JUST 5800 MILES.     VW OF AMERICA GAVE ME 30 DAYS TO ACCEPT THEIR FINAL OFFER: A REDUCED COST TO ME FOR THE REPAIR OF MY WORN CLUTCH.  VW IS NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE IS ANYTHING MECHANICALLY WRONG WITH MY CAR OR THE OPERATION OF THE MANUAL CLUTCH SYSTEM. THERE IS NO CONCERN FOR THE ONGOING ISSUE ONCE THE CLUTCH HAS BEEN RESTORED.
THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE TORQUE CONVERTER IN THE 2019 JETTAS (AUTOMATIC). WHEN DRIVING IN LOW RPM'S, THERE IS A LOUD GRINDING SOUND COMING FROM THIS AREA. THIS AFFECTS DRIVE-ABILITY, AS YOU NEED TO DRIVE MORE AGGRESSIVELY TO ELIMINATE THE SOUND. THERE ALSO ARE MULTIPLE REPORTS OF TRANSMISSION FLUID LEAKS. THESE ISSUES ARE ON BRAND-NEW MODELS OF THIS VEHICLE.
Incident Occurred in May. Was on Reddit and saw someone say to report any issues to NHTSA so that's what I'm doing   At the end of the month in May (2023) when starting my car after work that had been sitting in the sun, it turned on but then turned off about 10 seconds later saying "ignition switch off safely stop the vehicle" then it flashed to another screen saying "please check the starter system."  I waited about 10 minutes then I was able to start my car with no issue. Then after leaving work I pulled onto the highway and the issue happened again while going 60+ mph. Everything cut off and it gave me the same message. My jetta is a manual so it was still in gear and could keep driving but it was super sketchy. I immediately pulled off the road and when I came to a stop the car completely shut off. Then I waited another 10 minutes. Started my car again and the exact same thing happened and I had to pull off the highway.  After that I was able to start the car without it happening again and I drove straight to the Volkswagen dealer to have them fix it.  I left the the next day to go to a work conference out of state and returned the following Sunday to my car which was now fixed. Part P2532 was replaced in the ignition switch. Luckily I have a 4 year 40,000 mile warranty so I didn't have to pay anything.
VEHICLE IS BRAND NEW AND HAS BEEN IN MY POSSESSION FOR 7 DAYS. CAR-NET MODULE AND BLUETOOTH AUDIO MODULES HAVE BOTH FAILED. CAR-NET FAILED ON DAY 5, BLUETOOTH ON DAY 6. PRESCRIBED RESOLUTION INVOLVES PULLING THE APPROPRIATE FUSE TO RESET THE SYSTEM. AFTER THIS PROCEDURE, SYSTEM FAILED TO RESET.
The vehicle does not allow me to fill the fuel tank without the gas pump constantly cutting off within a few seconds of actuating the handle.  This forces me to repeatedly actuate the handle until I can get a reasonable amount of fuel into the tank.  Since the cut-off sensing is not working the fuel sometimes spills out of the filler neck creating an unsafe situation.  The dealer has informed me the fuel tank needs to be replaced and there is no recall on the vehicle that covers this issue.  I'm over the 50,000 mile warranty so that won't cover it either.  The fuel tank has been on backorder for two months (last I heard I am eighth in line) so it seems to the tank is defective.  There is no warning lamp in the dash. It seems to me the manufacturer should cover this.
Without warning, the rear brakes started making unusual scraping sound with slight loss of braking power.  Within a week of the issue took car to dealer who informed me that rear brake pads were completely worn out with calipers scraping and damaging the rotors.  VW refused to fix the issue via warranty.  By the end of the week,  the scraping escalated and significant loss of braking power occurred.  The premature failure or the braking pads and subsequent rotor damage seems to be a pervasive problem and well documented problem at VW.  Their approach to safety and resolution however very troubling.    The car was purchased new from the dealer 30 months ago and has 15,300 miles at the time of the incident.
1.It's not stable to drive in highway. Problem starts at around 55mph.  2. When I stop in traffic light suddenly rpm goes up and car jumps forward. It happened several times. The car was warm and in drive mode. I'm sure it shouldn't do this. Now when I stop in traffic light and pedestrian crossing in front of me, every time I put it to neutral and hold brake, in other ways just holding brake sometimes can not stop the car. If someone calls me I give more details.
The driver rear brake is sticking and locking up and has premature wear. Rear brakes and rotors have been replaced at 18,000 miles under warranty.. when driving rear brake does not release causing front tire to spin and create handling issues. The problem is worse and dangerous in wet conditions. Volkswagon calls it a wear and tear but it is a safety and handling issue. Case number 06285728
The contact owns a 2010 Volkswagen Passat. The contact stated that while her son was driving at an undisclosed speed, the vehicle inadvertently lost motive power. The driver was able to coast to the shoulder of the roadway, where the vehicle was able to be restarted. The check engine warning light was illuminated. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic, who diagnosed a failure with the thermostat. The vehicle was repaired. After investigating the failure, the contact related the failure to NHTSA Campaign Number: 17V509000 (Fuel System, Gasoline) but the VIN was not included. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was 61,000.
DRIVING HOME FROM WORK ON A BUSY ROAD WHEN ALL THE SUDDEN MY CAR STARTS TO SHAKE AND THEN THE EPC LIGHT CAME ON ENGINE STARTED FLASHING. I'VE READ A BUNCH OF THREADS WITH VOLKSWAGEN HAVING THIS ISSUE. [XXX] VEHICLES. YOU WERE FUNDED BY [XXX] HITLER NO WONDER.

MY CLOCK SPRING FAILED ON MY STEERING WHEEL AND HAD TO BE REPLACED FOR THE FIRST TIME.  SYMPTOMS WERE: THE WHEEL LOCKED UP, A CRUNCHING SOUND WAS HEARD, AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO TURN THE CAR.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT. WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL WAS TURNED, THE HORN INADVERTENTLY SOUNDED. THE VEHICLE HAD TO BE TURNED OFF AND RESTARTED TO DISENGAGE THE HORN. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE FAILURE BEGAN AFTER THE VEHICLE WAS SERVICED ON JANUARY 25, 2016 FOR NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 15V483000 (AIR BAGS). THE VEHICLE WAS NOT TAKEN BACK TO THE DEALER (AUDI BOISE, 8400 WEST FRANKLIN ROAD BOISE, IDAHO 83709, (208) 377-5400) FOR DIAGNOSTIC TESTING OR REPAIRS; HOWEVER, THE CONTACT REMOVED THE HORN RELAY. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 52,000.
HELLO,     MY 2010 VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT ENGINE RESULTED IN A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE BECAUSE THE TIMING CHAIN TENSIONER FAILED. THE ENGINE IS THE 2.0T MADE IN 2010. AFTER A QUICK SEARCH ON THE INTERNET IT SEENS LIKE MANY OWNERS OF THE 2.0T FROM THOSE YEARS HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM. THE ONLY SOLUTION IS TO REPLACE THE ENGINE AS ALL THE VALVES ARE BENT AND THE BILL IS OVER $8000, WHICH TOTALS MY CAR. MY CAR ONLY HAS 88000 MILES AND BAS BEEN FULLY SERVICE WITH PREMIUM FLUIDS ON ALL THE RIGHT INTERVALS. THE PROBLEM HAPPENED WHEN THE CAR PARKED FOR A WHOLE NIGHT AND WHEN I WENT TO TURN IT ON IT WAS CRANKING WITH A VERY ROUGH SOUND AND IT WOULDNT EVEN TURN ON; IT WOULDNT EVEN CRANK ANYMORE AFTER THAT. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS PROBLEM AS THOUSANDS OF CARS WITH THE 2.0T HAVE REPORTED THE SAME ISSUE. VOLKSWAGEN IS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE BUT YET THEY DON'T WANT TO ISSUE A RECALL.
TAKATA RECALL  I HAVE RECENTLY BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE (3 MONTHS AGO) & AM CONCERNED THAT IN THE EVENT OF A COLLUSION, IF THE AIRBAGS ARE DEPLOYED THAT I OR ONE OF MY PASSENGERS COULD BE SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED.   I SPOKE TO A REPRESENTATIVE FROM VOLKSWAGEN TODAY THAT ADVISED THAT THE ISSUE IS TYPICALLY FOR CONCERN IN CARS 6 YEARS & OLDER, OF WHICH MINE IS OVER 6 YEARS OLD NOW.  I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE BELIEVING THAT THE MANUFACTURERS WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO DRIVE A CAR THEY MANUFACTURED THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE SUCH SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT.  I FAIL TO UNDERSTAND THAT A COMPANY CAN HAVE A KNOWN ISSUE WITH SUCH DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES & YET THEY CANNOT FACILITATE THE REPAIRS IN A REASONABLE TIME & WORST STILL NOT GIVE THEIR CUSTOMERS A DATE AS TO WHEN THE REPAIR COULD BE DONE.  I UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE A CASE FOR LITIGATION IF I AM INJURED BUT I WOULD HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE INJURIES OR DEATH & NO AMOUNT OF MONEY COULD GIVE ME THE PEACE OF MIND I EXPECTED TO HAVE WHEN BUYING A VOLKSWAGEN VEHICLE.
CAR WAS PARKED. SHIFTING TRANSMISSION FROM P TO D OR R OR ANY GEAR WOULD RESULT IN THAT INDICATOR FLASHING AND ENGINE REVVING WHEN ACCELERATING.  CAR BEHAVED LIKE IT WAS IN NEUTRAL  THIS CAR HAS A DSG TRANSMISSION BUT THE VIN NUMBER DOESN'T FALL INTO THE ONES THAT VW HAS ACKNOWLEDGED HAVE ISSUES AND HAVE EXTENDED REPAIR WARRANTY.  TURNING OFF THE CAR AND RESTARTING CLEARED THE PROBLEM..THIS HAPPENED AGAIN ON ANOTHER OCCASION.  DSG WAS PROPERLY MAINTAINED AND DOCUMENTED AT 40K MILES AS PER SERVICE MANUAL....UPDATED 10-20/15*BF
WHEN DRIVING THE CAR IT SHUDDERS SLIGHTLY AND THEN STALLS (REGARDLESS OF SPEED). TWICE AT LOW SPEED (15MPH MAX) AND ONCE AT HIGHER SPEED (45MPH). IN TRAFFIC THIS COULD MEAN A REAR END COLLISION. *TR    BEFORE THIS HAPPENED THERE WERE A FEW TIMES ON THE ROAD WHERE THE CAR SHUDDERED AS IS IT WAS ABOUT TO STALL.
VEHICLE HAS NO COMPRESSION.  VILKSWAGOM DEALERSHIP STATED THAT TIMING CHAIN TENSIONER FAILED WILL COST $10000 TO FIX
The contact owns a 2012 Volkswagen Passat. The contact stated that while driving at an undisclosed speed, the air bag warning light illuminated. The dealer was made aware of the failure. The contact was informed that parts were not available to repair the vehicle. The contact received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 24V834000 (Air Bags); however, the part to do the recall repair was unavailable. The contact stated that the manufacturer had exceeded a reasonable amount of time for the recall repair. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was 70,000. VIN tool confirms parts not available.
Bought in July and had 38461 miles and only put 3000 miles since bought. Driving down the road and it started raining and had 2” of water in my drivers side floor board. Took to jack Morris auto glass and they looked at it and said the pan on the driver’s side of the sunroof was cracked. He told me that driving it was risky as it could catch fire and cause electrical issues. Please advise.
My 2012 Passat was supposedly repaired under a recall action for the clock spring.  However, same symptoms began to occur later in time and now it is apparent that the issue has not been solved and needs to be re-accomplished.
WAS DRIVING FINE ONE DAY AND THEN THE NEXT WEEK I DROVE IT...STARTED TO SEE LEAKS UNDER MY CAR AND I DIDN'T HAVE THE AC ON. IT GOT HARD TO TURN...FELT STIFF. WAS NOTICING THAT I WAS STARTING TO PAY MORE IN POWER STEERING FLUID TO KEEP MY CAR GOING. CONSIDERING I ONLY HAD IT 3MONTHS SINCE FIRST TIME I NOTICED THE PROBLEM.
FEB 2018 VW REPLACED THE AIRBAGS AND CLOCK SPRING.  APPROXIMATELY ONE YEAR LATER, THE AIRBAG LIGHTS CAME ON TOGETHER WITH THE ABS AND TIRE PRESSURE LIGHTS. I HAVE NO POWER TO THE STEERING WHEEL, NO HORN ETC.  MY STEERING IS GETTING TIGHTER AND TIGHTER TO TURN. I'M SURE THIS POSES SOME SORT OF A SAFETY RISK ESPECIALLY WHEN THIS IS THE ONLY VEHICLE I HAVE.  I WISH VW WOULD CORRECTLY IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM AND ISSUE A NATIONWIDE REMEDY TO CURE THIS DEFECT. THE SOONER THE BETTER SINCE VW HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS SINCE 2011. ALL OF THIS HAPPENED OVERNIGHT WHILE MY CAR WAS PARKED. I GOT INTO IT TO GO TO WORK AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED. PLEASE HELP YOUR CONSUMERS TO CURE THIS DEFECT AND NOT PUT A BAND-AID ON IT.
THE CAR BEGAN SHAKING ONCE IN A WHILE AND ABOUT A MONTH LATER BEGAN TO DIE WHEN IDLE WAITING AT RED LIGHTS OR STOP SIGNS. I WAS TOLD THE VACUUM SEAL NEEDED REPLACED BUT TO DO SO EVERYTHING WOULD NEED REPLACED AS YOU CAN'T JUST REPLACE A VACUUM SEAL. THE ELECTRICAL COMPONENT OF MY CAR STARTED TO GO HAYWIRE AND EVERY LIGHT, CLOCK WOULD GO OFF IF I TRIED TO START THE CAR.  AFTER THAT AS FIXED THE BATTER WHICH WAS TESTED AND AT 99% DIED AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.  THESE ISSUES HAPPENED WHEN I WAS ON A CITY STREET DRIVING AND I WAS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD WITH PEOPLE PASSING ME AND HONKING. I GOT THE CAR FIXED AT STEVEN'S CREEK VOLKSWAGEN IN SUNNYVALE, CA IT WAS VERY EXPENSIVE AND I WAS OUT OF A CAR FOR WELL OVER A WEEK. NONE OF THESE WERE ISSUES CAUSED BY ME. I HAVE VERY LOW MILEAGE AND TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY CAR.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT. WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS STARTED, THE AIR BAG INDICATOR ILLUMINATED AND THE VEHICLE LOST POWER. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO ONTARIO VOLKSWAGEN (701 SOUTH KETTERING DR, ONTARIO, CA, 91761) WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE CLOCK SPRING WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.

TAKATA RECALL. PURCHASED A 2012 VW PASSAT ON 08/07/2015. WAS NOT AWARE OF THE RECALL UNTIL THE SALESMAN MADE A FOLLOW-UP COURTESY CALL TO ME ON 08/08/2016.  HE WAS ADVISED I NEVER RECEIVED A LETTER.  I PHONED VW CUSTOMER CARE, VERIFIED MY ADDRESS AND REQUESTED A LETTER FROM THEM AFTER RENEWING MY REGISTRATION BUT NEVER RECEIVED A RECALL LETTER TO THIS DAY.  AUGUST 25, 2017 THE AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT CAME ON. SEPTEMBER 13, 2017 THE LOW TIRE INDICATOR LIGHT CAME ON.  I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO GOSSETT VW, HAD THE TIRES INFLATED AND WHEN I DROVE THE VEHICLE TWO DAYS LATER THE ABS/TRACTION CONTROL/TIRE PRESSURE/ AND SEATBELT LIGHTS WERE CONTINUALLY FLASHING. I SPOKE TO AN ADVOCATE VIA CHAT ON VW'S SEB SITE. SHE AUTHORIZED THE AIRBAG REPAIR ON 09/22/2017. I PAID APPROXIMATELY $341.00 TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH THE WARNING LIGHTS BUT TO DATE, 09/27/2017 THE PROBLEM PERSISTS.  THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT RESPOND TO MY COMPLAINT AND THE FILE WAS CLOSED ON 09/25/2017.  I PHONED CUSTOMER CARE EARLIER TODAY, WEDNESDAY, 09/27/2017 AND REOPENED THE CASE. MY VEHICLE ONLY HAD 38,415 MILES ON IT. THE REPAIR REPORT ACCORDING TO SERVICE AGENT J.O. CLAIMED THEY FOUND A SHORT TO THE PASSENGER OCCUPANT SENSOR CAUSING THE ABS LIGHT, TIRE LIGHT, AND TRACTION LIGHT. CORRECTION:  REPAIRED SHORT AND CLEANED RIGHT REAR SPEED SENSOR AND BEARING. ON 09/22, THE BOTTOM DRIVER TAKATA AIRBAG WAS PERFORMED. NOT ONLY ARE THE SAME LIGHTS ALARMING EACH TIME I TURN ON THE VEHICLE, BUT THIS MORNING THE ESP ERROR LIGHT FLASHED. VW CUSTOMER CARE WAS ADVISED AND REOPENED THE COMPLAINT. FOLLOWING THE SERVICE VISIT I DISCOVERED A BROKEN PART WITH VW # 8E0.881.348.E ON THE RIGHT FLOOR MAT OF THE CAR. THIS IS ALARMING. I WAS ADVISED AN ADVOCATE FROM VW CORPORATE SHOULD BE CALLING ME IN RESPONSE TO THIS HORRIFIC ORDEAL.  THESE INCIDENCES OCCURRED 2 WEEKS AFTER THE CERTIFIED PRE- OWNED WARRANTY EXPIRED.  NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE BEFORE THIS. I AM A SENIOR CITIZEN WHO IS EXTREMELY ALARMED WITH THIS MATTER.

"TAKATA RECALL"  NOTHING HAS HAPPENED YET,  BUT I'M SCARED TO DEATH EACH TIME I GET INTO MY CAR. I'M A NERVOUS WRECK.  SINCE FEBRUARY  9TH WHEN I GOT THE FIRST NOTICE.

I HAVE A 2012 VW PASSAT TDI VEHICLE WITH 78,000 MILES AS OF OCTOBER 124, 2016. IT IS EFFECTED BY THE TDI EMISSIONS ISSUE AND QUALIFIES UNDER THE COURT SETTLEMENT THAT HAS YET TO BE APPROVED.  THE ISSUE I HAVE IS THAT I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER ABOUT 1 MONTH AGO BECAUSE THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE AD BLUE HEATER WHICH SCRUBS NOX (ALBEIT NOT VERY WELL) FROM THE EXHAUST NEEDS TO BE REPLACED FOR $1,100.00.  I DID SOME RESEARCH AND CAME TO FIND OUT THAT APPARENTLY THIS HAS HAPPENED HUNDREDS OF TIMES TO TDI OWNERS ESPECIALLY 2012 MODELS.  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THE FAILURE IS A FUNCTION OF TIME NOT MILEAGE AND HAS BEEN CORRECTED IN NEWER MODELS. IT IS IRONIC THAT EVEN AFTER PAYING THE $1,100 MY CAR IS STILL OUT OF EMISSIONS COMPLIANCE!  I REQUEST THAT VW BE FORCED TO DO A RECALL AND REIMBURSE OWNERS REGARDLESS OF THE VEHICLES MILEAGE FOR THIS REPAIR.
"TAKATA RECALL" WE ARE DRIVING AROUND IN A DEATH TRAP!!  WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET THIS REPAIRED OR GIVEN ANOTHER VEHICLE TO DRIVE IN THE INTERIM?????!!!!    ELECTRICAL - ANOTHER DEATH TRAP!!

THIS VEHICLE EXPERIENCED A FAILURE OF THE HEATER CORE DUE TO CLOGGING. VISIBILITY THROUGH WINDSHIELD WAS RESTRICTED DUE TO HEAVY FOGGING AND POOR DEFROSTER PERFORMANCE OVER SEVERAL MONTHS. CLEANING OF THE WINDSHIELD WAS NO HELP. THE FOGGING WOULD COME AND GO DURING VEHICLE OPERATION AND WAS HEAVY AT TIMES. DIAGNOSIS TOOK SOME TIME DUE TO THE VEHICLE BEING ONLY A FEW YEARS OLD. GENERALLY A 3 YEAR OLD, WELL MAINTAINED VEHICLE WILL NOT HAVE A CLOGGED HEATER CORE. THE GRADUAL DIMINUTION OF HEAT DUE TO THE PROGRESSIVE CLOGGING CAUSED THE LACK OF FULL HEAT NOT TO BE APPARENT IN THE SPRING AND FALL MONTHS HOWEVER HEAVY FOGGING OCCURED DURING THESE SEASONS. IT WAS NOT UNTIL WINTER THAT THE LACK OF HEAT AND DEFROST WAS APPARENT. AFTER REPLACEMENT OF THE HEATER CORE ASSEMBLY THE ISSUE WAS RESOLVED.
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
I HEARD A CLICK WHEN I WAS TRURNING INTO MY DRIVEWAY AND THE AIRBAG MESSAGE APPEARED .
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING AT APPROXIMATELY 25 MPH, THE STEERING WHEEL SEIZED AND THE AIR BAG WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE CLOCK SPRING NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 57,000.
GLOW PLUG LIGHT ON DASHBOARD STARTED BLINKING.  MAJOR LOSS OF POWER.  HAD VEHICLE TOWED TO DEALERSHIP IN FAYETVILLE, NC.  PROBLEM REPORTED TO BE FAILED TURBO.  *TR
WHILE DRIVING FROM SAN DIEGO, CA  TO LOS ANGELES, CA ON I-5 AT 9PM ON OCTOBER 20TH, THE DAY AFTER PURCHASING THE CAR FROM A DEALERSHIP, I NOTICED MY HEADLIGHTS DO NOT ILLUMINATE THE ROAD. THE HEADLIGHTS ARE VERY DIM AND ONLY LIGHT UP ABOUT 10 FEET IN FRONT OF ME. I HAVE READ ON CAR FORUMS, PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUES WITH THEIR HEADLIGHTS. ONE INDIVIDUAL FRONTED $800 TO HAVE THE OEM FOG LIGHTS ADDED TO HIS PASSAT, WHICH HE CLAIMED HELPED. VW NEEDS TO FIX THIS HEADLIGHT PROBLEMS OR ADD THE FOG LIGHTS TO EVERY 2012+ PASSAT. WHILE DRIVING DURING THE NIGHT ON STREETS WITH LIMITED STREET LIGHTS, ITS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE AT NIGHT ESPECIALLY PEDESTRIANS, UNLESS I DRIVE WITH MY HIGH BEAMS ON, WHICH I CANT BECAUSE OF ON COMING CARS.  *TR
THE SPEEDOMETER DOES NOT REGISTER ACTUAL SPEEDS.  IT IS PESSIMISTIC BY 4 MPH AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  VW'S OWN CLIMATIC CONTROL DIAGNOSTIC READOUT INDICATES A SPEED THAT IS 2 MPH GREATER THAN THE SPEEDOMETER READS.  FURTHERMORE, THE TRIPOMETER AVERAGE SPEED READS 3 MPH GREATER THAN THE SPEEDOMETER.  MULTIPLE GPS UNITS ALL AGREE TO WITHIN A TENTH OR TWO MPH AND INDICATE A SPEED THAT IS 4 MPH FASTER THAN THE SPEEDOMETER.  (I.E. SPEEDOMETER READS 70 MPH, DIAGNOSTIC READOUT SIMULTANEOUSLY SHOWS 72 MPH, TRIPOMETER AVERAGE SPEED SIMULTANEOUSLY SHOWS 73 MPH AND GPS SIMULTANEOUSLY SHOWS 74 MPH WHILE CRUISE IS SET AT 70 MPH).  VW SAYS IT'S CLOSE ENOUGH AND THAT AT 70 MPH READINGS BETWEEN 65 AND 75 MPH ARE ACCEPTABLE!  *TR

I have had an issue with my transmission since I’ve got it. I got it with only 155,000 miles on it in Nov 2023. When i touch my brakes going slow or pull off from a red light my vehicle will make a Sharp noise and shook When i switch gears it will occasionally get stuck and shake when i pull off. I took it to Auto Plus Dealership service a couple times in 2023 where they assured me i had no transmission issue. I had other things like control arms and tires issues that i had fixed. But my car was still doing the same thing. So, i took it to various shops and Auto Plus Dealership service many times throughout the entire year of 2023. Then finally they told me there is a issue with my 02-sense kit and dual mass flywheel as well. During the time they found that issue it was only about 150, 000 miles on my vehicle. Auto Plus Dealership is known to have transmission issues so i was shocked when I was told about the recall. on the issue since my car had high miles on it and it is a known issue. It is progressively getting worse to where it is becoming a hazard and i can't continue to drive my vehicle. And now the Auto plus won't fix all this recall on my vehicle knowing how they sold the vehicle in the 1st place...

My car's engine performance weakened and it would not go past 40MPH. Two loops appeared on the dashboard flashing, pulled over turned off car then started it again. Two loop icon on dash went away. Started driving again and car would not drive past 20MPH and started making a weird loud noise. I was driving through Patterson Pass Road (very dangerous and super narrow road to even consider pulling over in) Pulled over again and parked my car and walked away from my car since that is too narrow to even consider waiting in the car. I called a towing company to have my car towed to VW dealership. I bought this car not even 2 years ago from VW with only 16k miles. Have done all maintenances on it and this is the second engine problem Ive had in less than 2 years. The first problem was replacing the EGR valve and now this.
MY 2013 VOLKWAGEN PASSAT I PURCHASED IN NOVEMBER OF 2019 HAS CONTINUED TO HAVE SO MANY PROBLEMS INVOLVING WHAT I HAVE BEEN TOLD THE MAJOR RECAL THE VOLKSWAGEN HAS FOR MY VEHICLE. HOW EVER I ONLY SEE THE RECAL FIX FOR MY VEHICLE BACK IN OCTOBER OF 2019 YET IT WAS BACK IN THE DEALER FOR THE SAME RECAL JUST 6 WEEKS AGO AND NOW I HAVE HAD IT IN ANOTHER MACHANIC SHOP FOR THE 2ND TIME NOW SAME RECAL ISSUES AND I CANT GET AN HONES ANSWER FROM ANY ONE. MY VEHICLE WAS ALSO SUPPOSED TO BE AT THE DEALER SHIP JUST ABOUT 6 WEEKS AGO BUT I WENT THERE AND MY VEHICLE WAS NOT THERE YET THEY WOULD NOT GIVE ME ANY INFORMATION AND MY GPS IS ON HOWEVER MY ACCOUNT INFORMATION IS INCORRECT.
THE CAR IS BURNING OIL AT AN ALARMING RATE. I HAVE TO ADD 4 QUARTS OF OIL BETWEEN OIL CHANGES.
SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR I'VE ALWAYS HAD ISSUES WITH THE OIL CONSUMPTION. I WAS TOLD IT WAS 'NORMAL' TO LOOSE UP TO 8 COURTS OF OIL IN-BETWEEN MY OIL CHANGES. THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THIS!!  THE CAR HAS BEEN VERY WELL TAKEN CARE OF, I GET OIL CHANGES EVERY COUPLE THOUSAND MILES INSTEAD OF EVERY 10,000 LIKE VW RECOMMENDS. IF I DID THIS MY ENGINE  WOULD QUIET LITERALLY BLOW UP. I'VE BEEN TOLD REPEATEDLY BY MULTIPLE FOREIGN REPAIR SHOPS (NON VW DEALERSHIP) THAT THIS IS A COMMON  ISSUE WITH THIS MOTOR BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON THE 2013 CC MODELS WERE NOT RECALLED. BY THE SOUNDS OF IT'S A REPAIR THAT VW REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE OR FIX. I'M UPSIDE DOWN ON THE LOAN & HAVE BEEN TOLD I BASICALLY NEED A WHOLE NEW ENGINE. NOW, EVERY TIME  I REFUEL I HAVE TO ADD A QUART OF OIL OTHERWISE MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON OR I RECEIVE A 'CHECK OIL PRESSURE. ENGINE OFF' MESSAGE. I MIGHT BE A FEMALE BUT I'M NOT THAT STUPID TO KNOW THAT THIS ISN'T NORMAL! THIS IS A CONSTANT ISSUE!
WHILE DRIVING MY 2013 VW PASSAT, THE AIRBAG LIGHT CAME ON, ON THE DASHBOARD AND STARTED BEEPING.  WHEN I PULLED INTO MY GARAGE, I NOTICED THAT THE HORN NO LONGER WORKED AND NONE OF THE STEERING WHEEL FUNCTIONS WORK ANYMORE.  I HAVE ONLY 56,718 MILES ON THE CAR AND THE VW DEALER SAYS IT IS NOT COVERED UNDER A RECALL AND I WOULD HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR THE REPAIR BECAUSE MY WARRANTY DEDUCTIBLE IS $500.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND VW SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO REPAIR THESE AIRBAG ISSUES, NOT US, THE CONSUMER.  THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE (THE CONSUMERS) ARE CAUSING, THIS IS A VW QUALITY ISSUE.
I WAS TRAVELING TO WORK ON INTERSTATE 85 (WHICH AS FOUR LANES) AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WAS A GUN SHOT/EXPLOSION SOUND THAT RATTLED MY CAR. I FROZE AND CLOSED MY EYES (THANK GOD I WAS ON A STRAIGHT ROAD & DID NOT YANK MY STEERING WHEEL), WHEN I OPENED I WAS COVERED IN GLASS. FOR SOME REASON, MY SUN ROOF EXPLODED FOR NO APPARENT REASON. IT WAS NOT BELOW FREEZING OR EXTREME HEAT AND I HAD NOT BEEN UNDER AN OVERPASS. I HAD GLASS IN MY CLOTHES, MY MOUTH, MY HAIR, AND ALL IN MY CAR.
CLOCK SPRING WENT OUT.  THIS IS A RECALL FOR 2013 PASSAT, HOWEVER MY VIN IS EXCLUDED. NOT HAPPY
IN OCTOBER 2017 I PURCHASED A PASSAT TDI FROM ARMSTRONG VOLKSWAGEN IN GLADSTONE OREGON. I THEN FOUND OUT ABOUT THE CLOCK SPRING RECALL. WITHIN A MONTH OF OWNING THE VEHICLE, MY ENTIRE STEERING WHEEL COMPONENTS STOPPED WORKING AND THE AIR BAG LIGHT CAME ON. WHILE DRIVING, MY AIRBAG LIGHT REMAINS ON, NONE OF MY STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS WORK, WHEN I TURN MY STEERING WHEEL IT ALMOST MAKES A CRUNCHY NOISE BEHIND THE STEERING WHEEL, AND I AM CONCERNED FOR MINE AND MY FAMILIES SAFETY WHILE DRIVING MY CAR. I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AND SPOKE WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER WHO INFORMED ME THAT THEY PERSONALLY REPLACED THE CLOCK SPRING IN JANUARY 2016. I ASKED THEM IF THEY WOULD PLEASE RE-FIX IT, AS THE FIRST FIX DID NOT WORK, AND THE CLOCK SPRING WAS ALREADY BAD AGAIN, LESS THAN 2 YEARS LATER. THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD DONE WHAT WAS LEGALLY REQUIRED OF THEM, AND THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE FIXING MY CAR. I THEN ASKED TO SPEAK TO THE GENERAL MANAGER, WHOM I LEFT A VOICEMAIL FOR, TO SEE IF HE COULD HELP. HE HAS YET TO CALL ME BACK, TWO WEEKS LATER.
AT 65,000 MILES, HEADLAMP LOW BEAM, DRIVER SIDE STOPPED WORKING. VEHICLE IN MOTION.
TAKATA RECALL - I WOULD LIKE TO GET FIXED ASAP INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR THIS TICKING TOME BOMB TO EXPLODE.
BECAUSE THE VEHICLE ALSO WAS TDI, VW BOUGHT THE VEHICLE BACK FROM ME ON 21 DECEMBER 2016, I.E.,  I NO LONGER OWN THE VEHICLE.  I RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE FOR THE THIS CAR A FEW MONTHS AGO AND FILLED OUT THE FORM TELLING ADDRESSEE (VW) THAT THEY HAD BOUGHT MY VEHICLE AND I SHOULD NOT RECEIVE ANY MORE NOTICES.  I CALLED VW THIS MORNING (28 JULY 2017) TO GET THEM TO STOP SENDING ME RECALL NOTICES.  THEY TOLD ME THEY DID NOT SEND IT YOU DID.  THEY SUGGESTED THAT I CONTACT THE FLORIDA DMV, BUT THAT IS MORE THAN USELESS: THEY DO NOT SEND THE NOTICES AND KNOW THAT I KNOW LONGER OWN THE VEHICLE IN QUESTION.  SINCE VW WAS KIND ENOUGH TO SELL ME A REPLACEMENT VW PASSAT FOR LESS MONEY THAN THEY PAID ME FOR THE 2013 PASSAT, I BOUGHT IT.  SO, WHEN I GET A VW RECALL NOTICE I THINK IT IS FOR THE NEW ONE NOT THE OLD ONE.  THIS IS VERY UNPLEASANT, SINCE WE WERE ON PINS AND NEEDLES FROM SEPTEMBER 2015 UNTIL DECEMBER 2016 WONDERING IF THE AIR BAG WAS GOING TO BLOW UP IN OUR FACES.      CAN YOU FIND A WAY TO STOP SENDING ME RECALL NOTICES FOR THIS VEHICLE, PLEASE?  IT WOULD BE APPRECIATED GREATLY.  I WILL FILL OUT THE FORM AGAIN TELLING VW THAT I DO NOT OWN THE CAR, BUT HAVING DONE THAT BEFORE AND GIVEN THAT THE TOLD ME TODAY THEY HAD NO WAY TO STOP THE FLOW OF NOTICES FROM THEIR END, I AM ASKING YOU TO PLEASE CLOSE THE FILE ON THIS VEHICLE AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED.  YOU NEED TO SEND THIS NOTICE TO VW TO TELL THEM TO FIX THE AIR BAG IN THE CAR THEY BOUGHT BACK FROM ME.    YOUR HELP AND COOPERATION IN THIS REGARD WOULD BE APPRECIATED GREATLY,  THANKS IN ADVANCE IN CASE YOU CAN DO THIS FOR US.

TAKATA RECALL (NHTSA RECALL NUMBER: 16V078   RECALL DATE: FEBRUARY 9, 2016) IT IS ABOUT MY 2013 VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT RECALL. I HAVE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM MY MANUFACTURER THAT MY CAR GOT RECALL. HOWEVER, SEVERAL OCCASION I HAVE CONTACT TO VW DEALER AND MANUFACTURER TO FIX THIS SAFETY RECALL. THEY REPLIED TO ME THAT WHEN THIS SERVICE WILL AVAILABLE THEY WILL NOTIFY US. I BOUGHT THIS CAR AS FAMILY CAR. SO, MY WIFE AND 2 CHILDREN USED TO RIDE THIS CAR REGULARLY. AFTER THIS RECALL WE ARE AFRAID TO DRIVE THIS CAR WITH FAMILY. SO, NEED TO FIX THIS PROBLEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. MAY NEED DIRECT HELP NHTSA.

TAKATA RECALL   I FIND IT DEEPLY CONCERNING THAT VOLKSWAGEN WANTS ME TO DRIVE AROUND IN A LEASED VEHICLE THAT THEY FIND SO UNSAFE, THEY REFUSE TO EVEN SELL THIS VEHICLE. I RECEIVED A LETTER INFORMING ME THAT SHOULD I BE INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT, THE MOST IMPORTANT SAFETY ASPECT OF THE CAR COULD ESSENTIALLY ACT AS A BOMB, BLOWING SHRAPNEL IN MY FACE. WITH NO CURRENT REPAIR SOLUTION AVAILABLE, VOLKSWAGEN REFUSES TO PROVIDE ANY ALTERNATIVE PLANS TO MANAGE THIS SITUATION IN THE MEANTIME. MOST OTHER MANUFACTURERS HAVE BEEN PROACTIVE IN  PREVENTING FURTHER INJURIES AND DEATHS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS BY PROVIDING ALTERNATE SOLUTIONS. LEFT WITH NO OTHER OPTIONS, I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE MY VEHICLE AND PUT MY LIFE AT RISK DUE TO VOLKSWAGEN'S NEGLIGENCE.
I LEARNED OF THE RECALL WHILE ONLINE (RECALL IS DATED 2/9/16), AND WE STILL HAVE NOT BEEN NOTIFIED BY VOLKSWAGEN OF THE RECALL.  I CAME ACROSS THE INFORMATION ON MY OWN.  I ASKED ABOUT THIS AT THE VW SERVICE DEPARTMENT, AND THE STAFF HAD NO ANSWERS.  IS VW OBLIGATED TO GIVE US NOTICE OF THE RECALL AND TO OFFER A FIX IN AN EXPEDITED MANNER?
"TAKATA RECALL"     I HAVE HAD MY VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT SINCE MAY OF 2015, SINCE THEN MY JOURNEY AS A CUSTOMER HAS BEEN FRUSTRATING AND A VERY SCARY EXPERIENCED. ONCE I GOT THE CAR WITHIN A WEEK I TOOK IT TO MECHANICS TO GET THE USUAL DIAGNOSTICS DONE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE CAR. IT AUTOMATICALLY HAD THE TIRE WARNING LIGHT ON TILL DATE AFTER TIRE CHANGES, DIAGNOSTICS, AND TIMELY SERVICES. MY CAR'S STEERING CONTROL HAS BEEN A VERY BIG ISSUE, TURNING AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE VEHICLE ENDED UP TO BE VERY UNSAFE AS IF I WILL LOSE CONTROL OF THE CAR ONE DAY. I HAVE GONE TO GET WHEEL ALIGNMENTS, TIRE CHANGES, ARM CONTROL CHANGES AND OTHER SEVERAL REMEDIES THAT ALWAYS TEND TO RESOLVE IN THE SAME ISSUE WITHIN WEEKS. I HAVE PUT $1000 WITHIN THE LAST 4 MONTHS AND I HAVE STILL A CAR THAT IS GOING TO FALL APART VERY SOON. I AM ALSO EXPERIENCING THE AIR BAG SIGNAL BEING OFF EVERY TIME I ENTER MY CAR AND I AM DRIVING. AS A YOUNG MOTHER AND STUDENT, I HAVE FOUND THIS CAR TO HAVE TOO MANY ISSUES AND EVERY UNRELIABLE. TO HAVE ENTERED MY VIN IN THE RECALL SYSTEM AND REALIZING THAT MY CAR HAS A ROTATING CLOCK ISSUE WITH NO REMEDY HAS HAD ME VERY WORRIED, AND I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CHILDREN IN A VEHICLE THAT HAS NO SAFETY FEATURES THAT ARE DUE TO FAIL IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY. I IN SOME UNSAFE WEATHER CONDITIONS PAY FOR MTA OR CAB SERVICES TO GET TO LOCATIONS SAFELY.  TO HAVE A REMEDY THAT IS UNFOUND AS OF YET PUTS MY FAMILY AND MYSELF IN HARMS WAY.
I WAS MAKING A TURN INTO MY DRIVE WAY, WHEN I HEARD A CRACKING NOISE. AT THAT POINT MY HEADS UP DISPLAY SHOWED 'AIRBAG ERROR' AND MY AIRBAG LED LIT UP ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL. THE HORN AND OTHER CONTROLS ON MY STEERING WHEEL ARE NO LONGER FUNCTIONING. WE TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALER AND THEY WERE ABLE TO VERIFY THAT IT IS IN FACT THE CLOCK SPRING, BUT ARE NOT SURE IF IT WILL BE COVERED AS PART OF A RECALL YET.
THIS IS MY THIRD COMPLAINT ABOUT THIS VEHICLE.  DURING THE AUGUST FLOODING, WHILE DRIVING HOME FROM WORK AND PASSING THROUGH SOME WATER PILES MY CAR LOST THE BOTTOM ENGINE COVER, LOWER GRILL BROKE, GOT THEM REPLACED NO PROBLEM.  WINTER COMES AND WHEN IT GETS COLD FRONT DOOR FREEZES SHUT, REMOTE START BARELY WORKS ONLY WHEN IT WANTS TOO.  ALSO NO PROBLEM.  WE GOT OUT FIRST WINTER STORM THANK GOD I HAD PUT NEW TIRES BEFORE THIS.  HOWEVER DRIVING HOME SOME AREAS HAD A BIT OF SNOW FIRST I GET STUCK AND CANT TURN OFF TRACTION CONTROL.  THEN MY LOWER GRILL BREAKS AGAIN.  IS THE GRILL MADE OUT OF WATER BOTTLE PLASTIC.  IF EVERY TIME THERE IS A STORM I NEED TO SPEND 250 DOLLARS ON A LOWER GRILL THAT IS JUST A WONDERFUL CAR EXPENSE.  YOU TRY AND TRADE IN THE CAR AND THE VALUE JUST DROPPED.  THIS IS MY FIRST AND LAST VW.  HORRIBLE QUALITY THAT A BUMPER CAN'T WITH STAND SOME ACCUMULATION OF SNOW.  I WILL FILE A COMPLAINT WITH VW AS WELL, LETS HOPE THEY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  PLUS THEY STILL DID NOT CORRECT THE NAVIGATION AND BLUETOOTH ISSUE.   *TR
THIS IS MY SECOND ENTRY ABOUT THIS INCIDENT; THIS CAR WAS A CERTIFIED 2013 PASSAT TDI SEL THAT I HAD OWNED FOR FOUR DAYS! I HAD NEVER EVEN REFUELED IT ONCE AND THE FUEL PUMP EXPLODED ON I-95 IN MARYLAND AND THE ENSUING INCIDENT ALMOST COST ME MY LIFE. I WAS AT THE ENTRY TO THE BALTIMORE I-95 TUNNEL WITH NEARLY NO WHERE TO PULL OVER  ONCE THE CAR STOPPED--CARS AND TRUCKS WERE SWERVING AROUND ME TO AVOID HITTING ME. THE TUNNEL MOVING CREW CAME SHORTLY AFTER SINCE MY STOPPED CAR WAS AN EXTREME HAZARD--I AM HANDICAPPED AND HAD NO WHERE TO ESCAPE TO. I EVENTUALLY WAS TOWED BACK TO MY DEALER AND NOW THE CAR IS IN THE SHOP TO BE FIXED FOR 1&1/2 WEEKS. VW CLAIMS THAT THE REASON FOR THIS FAILURE IS THAT OWNERS ARE PUTTING GASOLINE IN WITH THE DIESEL. THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE IN MY CASE AS I ONLY HAD THE CARE FOR 4 DAYS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT AND THE DEALER HAD TOPPED IT OFF WITH THEIR OWN FUEL! VW IS NOT BEIG HONEST ABOUT THE SEVERITY OF THIS PROBLEM AND NHTSA NEEDS TO ORDER A TOTAL RECALL. IT IS A NEAR MIRACLE THAT I WAS NOT KILLED. IF I HAD BEEN IN THE TUNNEL WHEN THIS HAPPENED, AND WITH NO PLACE TO PULL OVER AT ALL, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ACCIDENT AND MOST LIKELY A FATALITY (ME!) PLEASE CONTACT ME IF YOU NEED MORE INFO.  *TR
STARTED HEARING A WHISTLING TYPE OF SOUND AND NOTICING THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT ACCELERATING WHEN I PUSHED ON THE PEDAL.  AS I TRIED TO PULL OFF THE ROAD THE VEHICLE STALLED AND I COULD NOT GET IT STARTED TO GET OUT OF THE ROAD.  VERY SCARY. IT FINALLY STARTED LONG ENOUGH TO GET TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND IT STALLED OUT AGAIN.    THERE WAS SMOKE COMING OUT OF THE EXHAUST PIPE.  THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT START AGAIN.  THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED IT AND HAVE IT SERVICED.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT CALLED TO TELL ME IT WAS THE TURBO AND THAT THE VEHICLE NEEDED A NEW ENGINE.  I WILL BE GOING TO THE DEALERSHIP ON MONDAY TO PICK UP THE VEHICLE BUT WILL HAVE A LIST OF QUESTIONS ON WHAT EXACTLY HAS BEEN REPLACED AND WHAT TYPE OF WARRANTY THIS NEW ENGINE HAS.  *TR
MY FIRST WEEK WITH THIS CAR AND THE BRAKES START TO MAKE THE NASTIEST SOUND. IT WAS AS IF IT HAD NO BRAKE PADS. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND ASKED THEM WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE CAR I SUSPECTED THE BRAKES FROM THE START. I HAD TO TAKE IT IN AND THEY CHECKED THEIR SITE AND IT REPORTED THAT ON THIS MODEL AND YEAR THE CARS CAME WITH A DEFECT IN THE BRAKES. THEY HAD TO REPLACE THEM WITH NEW ONES. 2 MONTHS LATER IT STARTS UP AGAIN. THE BAD THING IS THAT VW NEVER ADMITS TO THEIR FAULTY CARS. THEY SET ME UP WITH HIGH PAYMENTS AND WONT HELP ME WITH ANY OF MY CONCERNS. THE CAR IS NICE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT BUT WHY WOULD I WANT TO STAY WITH A FAULTY CAR AND HIGH PAYMENTS? MAKES NO SENSE!    *TR
THE BACKUP CAMERA IS VERY SLOW TO RESPOND WHEN PLACING THE VEHICLE INTO REVERSE (15-25 SECONDS). FREQUENTLY, THE CAMERA WILL NOT ACTIVATE UNTIL THE VEHICLE HAS COMPLETED BACKING UP AND THE VEHICLE IS PLACED INTO DRIVE. VOLKSWAGEN IS AWARE OF THE ISSUE, HAVING IDENTIFIED IT IN A VW TECHNICAL BULLETIN. I CONTACTED VOLKSWAGEN CUSTOMER CARE IN AUBURN, MI, ABOUT RESOLVING THE ISSUE. I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM[XXX], DATED 22 APRIL 2013, WHICH STATED: ". . . YOUR VEHICLE IS OPERATING AS PER ITS DESIGNED INTENT. AS SUCH, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE A REPAIR TO [THE] SYSTEM."

The contact owns a 2014 Volkswagen Passat. The contact stated that upon performing an oil change on the vehicle, the dealer informed the contact that both rear driver's side and passenger's side suspension springs were fractured and needed to be replaced. The contact was given an estimate for the repair. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 86,000.
The contact owns a 2014 Volkswagen Passat. The contact stated that while stopped at a yield sign, the contact was rear-ended by another vehicle. The contact stated that the air bags partially deployed upon impact which resulted in the contact hitting her head on the steering wheel. The contact later went to the hospital where she was treated for whiplash and a concussion. A police report was filed. Due to the failure, the contact could not use any of the electrical features on the steering wheel. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic where the contact was informed that her air bag failure was linked to  NHTSA Campaign Number: 24V834000(Air Bags); however, once the recall was serviced, the contact was informed that the recall was related to the air bag inflator, not the actual air bag. The vehicle had yet to be repaired. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was unknown.
While driving the vehicle and making a slow speed turn into a drive way, the wires in the clock spring portion of the Driver airbag were severed mechanism. This has caused the car to no longer have airbags on the Driver side of the car. Volkswagon has recalled some of the car in this model year, but they continue to say my vehicle is not affected. When this happened, I had less than 90,000 miles on the car.  I am unable to fix this defect because of the cost and honestly, I shouldn't have to as Volkswagon knows it's an issue and has made recalls of their cars, but they don't include my model year. This is wrong, as the issues I am having are the EXACT SAME AS THE CURRENT RECALL. The recall needs to be expanded to more cars in the 2014 model year. There is no way debris should be able to enter the clock spring area and sever the lines with normal use.  This puts my safety at risk because if I am in an accident, I do not have airbag protection.  I have not taken the car to a dealer as I cannot afford to,  the vehicle has not been inspected, but if that would help, I can get it inspected, and there were no lights, lamps or messages that warned of any problems with my airbag system until the wires broke.
Door latch failed to lock driver door. Door can't lock and will fly open when your operating. Acted up on a cold day where it wouldn't open then got stuck in the open position and wouldn't lock afterwards.
The recall listed on the previous page explains why visibility is so poor when low or high beams are on while driving, no matter what the weather conditions are. My safety, along with my family's safety, and oncoming traffic were put at risk due to such poor visibility. I don't have this problem with my other Volkswagen (2017 Jetta).  The other problem I encountered is with my steering wheel. I was turning and I heard what sounded like a crinkle type noise. It was rather brief so I didn't pay attention and then it made the sound again when I turned wheel in the opposite direction and again on my next turn.  The following day I heard the same type of noise while turning in either direction and then the noise sounded like a spring breaking. I then noticed a light on my dash come on. The light was orange in color displaying a similar no seat belt wearing flash display. Once I was home I looked into what dash light meant and it had to do with an airbag malfunction. I went on to notice that none of my steering wheel functions worked nor did my horn. I researched possible recall involving steering wheel clock spring in a 2014 Passat and found it was indeed a recall. I purchased this car for my soon to be licensed son and he needs these recalls fixed as soon as possible in order to use car for his driving test in April. The nearest VW dealer is in Green Bay, WI which is a few hours away from my home. I was informed by a close friend that works for VW that recalls could be fixed by Halbinsel Mazda in Escanaba MI. My other VW is currently in storage and I am unable to get to it until spring time when the snow melts. This leaves me with the Passat with poor visibility and if I were to get in an accident the airbag wouldn't deploy because of clock spring recall nor can I warn anybody by honking my horn. Both recalls are putting myself, my loved ones and traffic at major safety risks. My vehicle is available for inspection, so matter can be resolved as soon as possible.
there is a TDI/AEM Emissions service action  CODE: 23Z3  for this year TDI,  that requires Dealer Software 'fix" ,   I have owned the car for a year now , with no contact from VW.  Also, have read that there is a Recall on the Heater Cores getting clogged, and causing fogging windsheilds,  driving hazard.   And no contact from VW ?

REPLACED RADIATOR IN 2/2017 AND HEATER CORE IN 12/2017. 10/2019 HEAT FAILED AGAIN.  HEAT IS INSUFFICIENT TO KEEP WINDSHIELD CLEAR IN COLD ICY WEATHER IN NORTHEAST.   WINTER IS HEAR AGAIN AND HEAT IS INADEQUATE TO KEEP WINDSHIELD CLEAR.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING AT APPROXIMATELY 25 MPH, THE VEHICLE FAILED TO SHIFT TO SECOND AND THIRD GEAR WHILE THE TRANSMISSION WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED CONTINUOUSLY. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHO STATED THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO ASSIST WITH THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTING OR REPAIR OF THE VEHICLE. THE VOLKSWAGEN DEALER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE.  THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 69,125.
DEC 26  2018 THE CAR STALLED AS I WAS BACKING UP OUT OF MY PARKING SPACE,  PUSHED THE CAR BACK INTO THE SPACE AND WAITED 20 MINUTES AND THE CAR STARTED AND I DROVE IT TO THE VW DEALER AND WAS TOLD DO NOT USE WAWA GAS.  JUNE 21  2019 THE CAR STALLED AS I WAS BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE AT TRADER JOES PUSHED THE CAR BACK INTO SPACE .WAITED 20 MINUTES STARTED CAR WENT TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT FIND ANY PROBLEMS CAR HAD 69,050 MILES STILL UNDER WARRANTY.  OCTOBER 1 ST BACKING OUT OF TRADER JOES PARKING LOT AND CAR STALLS AGAIN WAIT 30 MINUTES AND THEN DRIVE TO THE DEALER AND I AM TOLD I NEED A FUEL PUMP AND MODULE. AND NOW THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY..  I HAVE READ THAT SEVERAL MODELS OF VW HAVE BEEN RECALLED FOR THE FUEL PUMP BUT MINE WAS NOT INCLUDED.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT. THE CONTACT STATED THAT TRANSMISSION FLUID WAS LEAKING FROM THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHERE THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED THAT THE TRANSMISSION COOLER O-RING WAS LEAKING AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT TAKEN TO A DEALER FOR DIAGNOSTIC TESTING OR REPAIRS. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 63,000.   *TR
TAKATA RECALL    I HAVE BEEN RECEIVING RECALL NOTICES FOR MY 2014 VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT FOR THE PAST YEAR YEAR.  I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY VOLKSWAGEN DEALER IN MARCH OF 2018, BROUGHT THE CAR IN SO THEY COULD FIX THE RECALL.  AFTER TAKING THE DAY OFF, AND WAITING FOR THE CAR, I WAS TOLD THAT THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT HAVE THE CORRECT PART TO FIX IT, AND THEY COULD NOT COMPLETE THE REPAIR.  I WAS TOLD I WOULD BE CONTACTED AS SOON AS THEY RECEIVED THE PART.  LAST MONTH, I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE RECALL AND WAS TOLD THEY STILL DID NOT HAVE THE PART.  I CONTACTED VOLKSWAGEN, THEY PUT ME IN TOUCH WITH ANOTHER DEALER, I CONTACTED THAT DEALER.  THEY ALSO DID NOT HAVE THE PART. AGAIN I WAS TOLD, WE WILL CONTACT YOU WHEN WE HAVE THE PART.  THAT WAS OVER A MONTH AGO. YESTERDAY, I RECEIVED ANOTHER RECALL NOTICE.  HOW DO GET MY RECALL FIXED IF THE DEALERSHIPS DO NOT HAVE THE PARTS?  DO I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE CAR IMPLODES?  PLEASE HELP!
TRANSMISSION FLUID COOLER LEAKAGE DRIPPING FLUID WHERE IT MIGHT CONTACT A HOT SURFACE AND RESULT IN A VEHICLE FIRE.  ALLEGEDLY ACCORDING TO VW THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN IN VEHICLES WITH MY VIN, BUT MY MECHANIC SAYS IT IS HAPPENING.
TRANSMISSION ERRATIC SHIFTING.  VERY COMMON ISSUE!
AIRBAG CLOCK SPRING BROKE WHILE I WAS DRIVING . WHY WASN'T MY VEHICLE COVERED UNDER RECALL FOR THE AIRBAG CLOCK SPRING RECALL NUMBER 15V483000? OBVIOUSLY MORE VEHICLES ARE AFFECTED. MY AIRBAG AND INSTRUMENT CONTROLS DO NOT WORK NOW DUE TO THIS SAFETY ISSUE.
TAKATA AIRBAG
TL* TAKATA RECALL. THE CONTACT LEASED A 2014 VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE DEALER MADE NO MENTION THAT THE VEHICLE WAS INCLUDED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 16V078000 (AIR BAGS). THE CONTACT WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE WHEN THE MANUFACTURER WOULD SUPPLY THE PARTS. THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE. PARTS DISTRIBUTION DISCONNECT.
TAKATA RECALL.  MY CAR WAS IMPACTED BY THE 2/9/16 RECALL OF TAKATA AIRBAGS. WE RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM VW LAST MARCH. THE DEALER HAS REFUSED TO RETURN CALLS, PROVIDE A REPAIR DATE, OFFER A LOANER CAR UNTIL THE REPAIR COULD BE MADE, THEY ARE ALSO REFUSING TO REPLACE OR REFUND FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE CAR.    MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER IS DRIVING A CAR THAT COULD KILL HER AND NO ONE IS INTERESTED IN HELPING US OR PROVIDING A SOLUTION. AFTER WAITING 12 MONTHS FOR ANY PLAN OF ACTION FROM VW WE ARE  REQUESTING HELP FROM THE NHTSA.  *TR
TAKATA RECALL: THE CAR IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE BECAUSE OF THE AIRBAG CONSTITUTES A LETHAL THREAT.  THE VALUE OF THIS VEHICLE HAS OF COURSE PLUMMETED AS A RESULT, MAKING TRADING IT IN ECONOMICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. THE RECALL IS MORE THAN A YEAR OLD, AND THERE IS NO REMEDY IN SIGHT. VW SEEMS TO BE SIDESTEPPING RESPONSIBILITY HERE, AND TELLING CUSTOMERS "DON'T BLAME US--BLAME TAKATA."  BUT TAKATA WAS VW'S SPECIFIC OEM!
TAKATA RECALL: WHEN I WAS FIRST NOTIFIED OF THE RECALL AROUND THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, I MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE THE RECALL FIXEDA FEW MONTHS LATER. WHEN I ARRIVED, NOBODY BOTHERED TO INFORM ME THE PART WAS NOT AVAILABLE. THIS WAS MAYBE IN MAY. RECENTLY, I CALLED VW OF AMERICA ABOUT THE SAFETY CONCERN. THEY SAID THEY WOULD NOT BUY THE CAR BACK FROM ME OR SWAP IT OUT FOR ANOTHER CAR BUT GAVE NO EXPLANATION. WHEN I CALLED CHERRY HILL VOLKSWAGEN TO ASK WHY, IF THE CAR WAS SO SAFE THEY WOULD NOT BUY IT BACK FROM ME, THE SALESPERSON WAS RUDE TO ME AND CLAIMED I KNEW WHAT I WAS GETTING INTO WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR. I AM NOT SURE WHAT THAT MEANS AS I WAS UNAWARE OF THE RECALL. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING MY CHILDREN AROUND IN THIS CAR.  *TR
TAKATA RECALL - DEFECTIVE AIR BAG INFLATOR STILL IN VEHICLE 2.5 YEARS AFTER PURCHASE. PUTS AT RISK LIVES OF DRIVER AND PASSENGERS. IMMEDIATE REPLACEMENT NEEDED.
TAKATA RECALL - SO WHEN WILL THE FIX BE AVAILABLE?  IN THE MEANTIME, I AM DRIVING AROUND WITH A BOMB IN MY STEERING WHEEL?  CAN WE HAVE THE AIRBAG DISCONNECTED UNTIL THE TAKATA REPAIR IS AVAILABLE?  NO AIR BAG WOULD BE BETTER THAN ONE THAT KILLS THE DRIVER.
TAKATA RECALL-  I RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE IN APRIL 2016.  I WENT TO THE DEALER AT THAT TIME AND WAS TOLD THAT THE PARTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE.  I CALLED AGAIN AND WAS TOLD THAT THE PARTS WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL AFTER JULY 11, 2016.  I JUST RETURNED FROM THE DEALER, WHERE THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY STILL DO NOT HAVE THE PARTS.  THE RECALL NOTICE STATES THAT AN INFLATOR RUPTURE CAN RESULT IN SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH.  THE VOLKSWAGEN DEALER, VOLKSWAGEN OF MURRIETA (CALIFORNIA), REFUSED TO PROVIDE A RENTAL CAR FOR USE UNTIL THE DEFECT IS REPAIRED.
TOOK OUR 2014 PASSAT TDI IN FOR A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON 7/18/16 AFTER TESTING A FAULT CODE OF P2196 INDICATED AN 02 SENSOR WAS FAULTY. NEGOTIATED TO $300 TO REPAIR/REPLACE UNIT.  PICKED UP VEHICLE ON 7/21/16 AFTER REPAIR WAS MADE. ON 8/3/16 CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AGAIN CAME ON. RETURNED TO DEALER AND THEY INDICATE THAT THE ADBLUE HEATER ELEMENT WAS FAULTY. RECOMMEND REPLACING AT A COST OF CLOSE TO $1,000.00.  SINCE THIS IS PART OF THE EMISSIONS ISSUE WE FEEL THAT THIS SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER ANY AND ALL WARRANTY.  THE VEHICLE HAS 48,875 MILES ON IT AND IS ONLY 2 1/2 YEARS OLD.
TL* TAKATA RECALL. THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT. THE CONTACT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 16V078000 (AIR BAGS); HOWEVER, THE PART TO DO THE REPAIR WAS UNAVAILABLE. THE MANUFACTURER EXCEEDED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THE RECALL REPAIR. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED. THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE. VIN TOOL CONFIRMS PARTS NOT AVAILABLE.
I RECEIVED A TAKATA SII DRIVER FRONTAL AIRBAG RECALL NOTICE INDICATING THE THE DRIVER AIRBAG INFLATOR COULD POTENTIALLY RUPTURE IF THE VEHICLE IS INVOLVED IN A CRASH WHICH MAY RESULT IN SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH. VWOA DOES NOT HAVE A SOLUTION OR A REPLACEMENT PART FOR AFFECTED CARS. I CONTACTED MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP (SANTA BARBARA VW) AND SPOKE TO THE SERVICE MANAGER, STEVE ROSS ABOUT PROVIDING A LOANER VEHICLE FREE OF CHARGE UNTIL THE RECALL WAS RESOLVED. THE SERVICE MANAGER REFUSED TO PROVIDE ME A LOANER AND TOLD ME TO CALL VW CUSTOMER SERVICE. I SPOKE TO EUGENE (5/18/16) @ VW CUSTOMER SERVICE REQUESTING A COMPLIMENTARY LOANER (HONDA IS PROVIDING COMPLIMENTARY LOANERS) AND HE WAS NOT ABLE TO ASSIST ME. WHEN I ASKED TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT THE RECALLED TAKATA AIRBAG IN MY 2014 VW PASSAT WAS SAFE  EUGENE AT CUSTOMER CARE WAS NOT ABLE TO CONFIRM (ASKED HIM REPEATEDLY) THAT THE RECALLED AIRBAG IN MY VEHICLE WAS SAFE EVEN AFTER I RECITED LINE BY LINE, THAT THE RECALL LETTER INDICATES THAT THE TAKATA AIRBAG REPRESENTS A SAFETY HAZARD. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT MY LOCAL DEALER PROVIDE ME WITH A SUITABLE LOANER UNTIL THIS ISSUE IS RECTIFIED AS IT REPRESENTS A CLEAR AND PRESENT SAFETY HAZARD.
SUFFERED A TURBO FAILURE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2014 VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT. WHILE DRIVING AT 45 MPH, THE VEHICLE STALLED AND THE CHECK ENGINE WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE SOFTWARE NEEDED TO BE UPDATED. THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED; HOWEVER, THE VEHICLE WOULD OPERATE AS IF IT WERE TO STALL AFTER THE SOFTWARE UPDATE WAS COMPLETED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 11,000.
WHEN STEERING THE VEHICLE, WITH MINOR LANE CORRECTION INPUTS, THERE IS A COUNTER FORCE FROM THE VW ELECTROMECHANICAL ACTIVE STEERING SYSTEM THAT WILL NOT LET ME TURN THE WHEEL UNLESS I APPLY HARDER PRESSURE.  WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL FREES UP, IT?S AS IF IT BROKE FREE OF SOME STICKY SUBSTANCE. AT TIMES THIS FORCE HAS BEEN SO HARD THAT THE PASSENGERS WERE JOSTLED IN THE CAR. VW MECHANIC HAS DESCRIBED THE ISSUES AS A DEAD SPOT IN THE STEERING..   THE ISSUE OCCURS UNDER THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS;  1) ON AN INTERSTATE HIGHWAY WITH RELATIVELY MINOR CAMBER ANGLES.  2) ON NEW VERY SMOOTH DRY PAYMENT ? IMPORTANT - DOES NOT OCCUR ON ROUGHER NEWER PAVEMENT.  3) SET SPEED CONTROL AT 64 MPH - OCCURS AT HIGHER SPEEDS AS WELL. HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED THE ISSUE UNDER 60 MPH.  4) OCCURS IN ALL LANES BUT I DRIVE MOSTLY IN THE RIGHT LANE.  5) IN A STRAIGHT LINE RUN OF 1/8 OF A MILE OR SO WHERE THE STEERING ANGLE IS CENTER-LINED.  6) TURN THE WHEEL WITH MINOR DRIVER STEERING INPUTS/ANGLES TO STAY IN THE LANE - NOT TRYING TO CHANGE LANES.  VW TRIED TO REPAIR THE ISSUE WITH A SOFTWARE FIX.  IT DIDN'T WORK. THEY NOW SAY THE CAR IS FUNCTIONING AS DESIGNED.  *TR
I WAS DRIVING ABOUT 40MPH WHEN A CAR TRIED TO MERGE INTO MY LANE.  I TRIED TO BLOW THE HORN AND THE HORN FAILED TO WORK.  THIS HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES BUT NOT AT A POINT WHERE I HAVE BEEN THIS CLOSE TO BEING CRASHED INTO.  WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THE CHANGE TRACK AND VOLUME BUTTONS DO NOT WORK, AS WELL AS THE HANDS FREE CALLING BUTTON.  IT'S LIKE THE WHOLE STEERING WHEEL GOES DEAD.  *TR
Gas and Oil comsumption is way too high … Almost every 600-1000 the low oil lights turns on! Check engine on almost all the time due to an error with the oxígen sensor. EPC light gets on very frequently and the car loses speed. Also vehicle has a constant rattlesnake sound when speed is low. Issue was reported some years ago to a local VW dealership in Georgia but they never took care of the issue. Ongoing for a couple of years!. No additional details
Mice and rodents just love eating various electrical wires, vacuum lines, diesel fuel lines (both from tank to engine & return lines), etc.  Never once had any animals issues with my other vehicles.  Discovered that VWoA thought it would be a brilliant idea to use Soy in the manufacturing of electrical insulation, fuel hoses, vacuum lines, etc.  ANIMALS LIKE EATING SOY.  Very frustrating.  My vehicle has been disabled before and one time I sprang a nice leak, leaving a trail of diesel behind me.  Since all repairs and parts were ordered and conducted at local VW dealership.  All records are both on carfax & stored in VWoA servers.
The contact owns a 2015 Volkswagen Passat. The contact stated while driving at an undisclosed speed, the air bag warning light illuminated. Additionally, the horn was inoperable. The vehicle was taken to the dealer where it was diagnosed that the clockspring needed to be replaced; however, the clockspring part was on backorder. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure and a case was opened. The manufacturer informed the contact that an ETA for parts was not available. The failure mileage was approximately 167,000.
ABS module failure at 56,000 miles. Warning lights illuminated on dashboard are ABS, brakes, stability control, tire pressure and airbags. Local VW dealer inspected and confirmed failure of ABS module.
THIS IS REGARDING THE AIR CONDITIONER (AC). I PURCHASED A USED 2015 VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT FROM PEARSON CHRYSLER JEEP DODGE ON FEB.16, 2020; ODOMETER READING WAS 54454.  I DID NOT TEST DRIVER THE CAR BEFORE I PURCHASED IT. THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE. WHEN I PICKED THE CAR UP A FEW DAYS LATER, THE SALESPERSON TURNED THE AC ON HIGH SPEED. I TURNED IT OFF AND HE TURNED IT BACK ON. I TURNED IT OFF AGAIN. IT APPEARED HE WAS HIDING SOMETHING. IT WAS FEBRUARY. I DID NOT NEED THE AC ON. MY SON AND I WAS QUICK TO NOTICE THIS NOISE THAT SOUNDED LIKE A HOT WATER HEATER NOISE. DESCRIPTION:  THE NOISE IS LIKE A SMALL HOT WATER HEATER MAKES WHEN THE WATER TEMPERATURE IS COOL AND THE HEATER COMES ON TO INCREASE THE TEMPERATURE SO THAT THE WATER IS HOT AGAIN. THE NOISE CONCERNING THE AC CONTINUED. IN MARCH, PEARSON HAD VOLKSWAGEN KIA SERVICE MY VEHICLE. ACCORDING TO THE INVOICE FROM WB VOLKSWAGEN KIA, THEY INSTALLED A/C DYE. THE NOISE WAS VERY LOW. IN MAY I NOTICED THE AC WAS NOT COOLING MY CAR.  I DROPPED MY CAROFF AT PEARSON SERVICE DEPT.ON JUNE 3 &JUNE 10. PEARSON INVOICE STATED, "SUBLET VEHICLE TO WB VOLKSWAGEN, VW. FOUND CONDENSER FAULTY, VOLKSWAGEN EVACUATED A/C SYSTEM, REMOVED AND REPLACED CONDENSER, RECHARGED A/C TO PROPER LEVEL. RECHECKED. OK"  THE NOISE IS STILL THERE. I FIND THIS INTERESTING, THE INVOICE IN MARCH WAS DOCUMENTED FROM VOLKSWAGEN KIA AND THE SECOND INVOICE FROM PEARSON FOR THE RECORD, A SERVICE REP. IN THE SERVICE DEPT. AT PEARSON TOLD ME THAT THEY DO NOT WORK ON FOREIGN CAR. I WOULD LIKE THE NOISE TO CEASE PERTAINING TO THE AIR CONDITIONER. I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS ISSUE WITH AIR CONDITIONER IN CARS THAT OWNED IN THE PAST.
TAKATA RECALL. I TRIED TO DO FACTORY RECALL AIRBAG, BUT MY AIRBAG MODULE IS NOT WORKING. THE DEALER DOESN'T/CANNOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. AIRBAG INDICATOR SOMETIMES BLINKS AND SOMETIMES DOESN&#8217;T. MY VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT  IS 2015.
CLOCK SPRING FAILURE!!!  CLOCK SPRING FAILURE!!!  CLOCK SPRING FAILURE!!!    WHILE MOVING AND EXECUTING A RIGHT TURN A CRUNCHING NOISE WAS HEARD FROM THE CENTER OF THE STEERING WHEEL. THE AIRBAG LIGHT IMMEDIATELY CAME ON. ALSO, THE HORN & ALL STEERING WHEEL BUTTONS/CONTROLS FAILED.       THIS CAR WAS PURCHASED A WEEK PRIOR FROM CARVANA. 49,300 MILES ON THE ODO. TOO LATE TO RETURN IT. THE CLOCK SPRING FAILURE MEANS THAT THE AIRBAG SYSTEM IS NOT ACTIVE UNTIL THE PART IS REPLACED, INSTALLED, AND THE SYSTEM IS RESET.        A QUICK READ THRU OF THESE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS FROM MODEL YEAR 2015 SHOW THESE FAILURES OF A SAFETY-CRITICAL PART OVER THE LAST 18 MONTHS ARE NOW OCCURNG WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY.  IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS TO ME THAT VWOA/CHATTANOOGA INSTALLED THE SAME DEFECTIVE PART, FROM THE SAME SUPPLIER, THAT FAILS AFTER ABOUT 2.5-3 YEARS IN SERVICE. THIS PROBLEM IS NO DIFFERENT THAN THAT OF THE THOUSANDS OF IDENTICAL FAILURES IN VW PASSAT MODEL YEARS 2012, 2013, & 2014 LEADING TO A RECALL OF THE DEFECTIVE COMPONENT.    IMMEDIATE ACTION IS REQUIRED BY DOT TO READDRESS AND RECALL THIS PREVIOUSLY RECALLED PART.  VW DEALERS ARE CURRENTLY CHARGING 2015 PASSAT OWNERS BETWEEN $500 AND $800 TO INSTALL A $35 PART.  IF THEIR PASSAT IS OLDER THAN 2015, THE PART IS INSTALLED GRATIS AS PART OF THAT RECALL..     VW WILL NOT ACT UNTIL PROMPTED/ORDERED TO DO SO. SOMETHING IS ROTTEN IN WOLFSBURG AGAIN!     LET'S QUICKLY ACT BEFORE MORE ARE HARMED/KILLED BECAUSE AN AIRBAG SYSTEM FAILED TO OPERATE WHEN PARAMETERS DICTATED IT SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED.
ALL LIGHTS CAME ON AT SAME TIME, NO NOTABLE REASON GIVEN FOR ISSUE. JUST TOLD COSTS ASSOCIATED AREN'T UNDER WARRANTY OR RECALLS.
CPSC:PURCHASED KYB 344459 AND KYB 335808 (SHOCKS AND STRUTS) FROM AUTOZONE AND INSTALLED ON  01/06/2018. PRODUCT WAS PURCHASED ACCORDING TO MY VIN FOR FITMENT. AFTER INSTALLATION MY CAR  HAS BEEN OPERATING VERY UNSAFE, SUSPENSION IS EXTREMELY HARD, BOUNCY, WAVY, ECT. *DT *JS
CAR START BUTTON WILL NOT START CAR. CAR IN PARK POSITION, BRAKES ARE PRESS AND CAR START PRESS BUT CAR DOES NOT START. THERE WAS NO SOUND OF THE MOTOR TURNING. TRIES IT TWO MORE TIMES AND ON THE THIRD TIME IT STARTED.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING AT 55 MPH, THE ENGINE STALLED WHILE THE BATTERY WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO A DEALER WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE COMPUTER SOFTWARE NEEDED TO BE UPDATED. THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED BUT THE FAILURE RECURRED NUMEROUS TIMES. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 12,000.
VEHICLE LOST POWER WHILE DRIVING.  SEVERAL WARNING LIGHTS APPEAR.  THIS OCCURRED THREE OTHER TIMES, EVEN AFTER THEY CAR HAD BEEN IN FOR REPAIR.  VARIOUS ENGINE PARTS HAVE BEEN REPLACED, SUCH THE TURBO KIT, TURBO CHARGER, GLOW PLUGS.  THE LAST INCIDENT OCCURRED ON DEC 5 AFTER PICKING THE VEHICLE UP AND ASSURED THAT IT WAS FULLY REPAIRED.  WHILE EXITING THE DEALERSHIP, THE CAR LOST POWER AND I WAS ALMOST T-BONED.    THE DEALER CONTINUES TO REPLACE PARTS ON THE ADVICE OF THE VW REGIONAL SERVICE MANAGER.  YET WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE WHEN IN MOTION.  THEY HAVE PUT MORE MILES ON IT THAN WE HAVE.  *TR
Steering column makes noises when turning.  Airbag Light is on and the none of the steering wheel controls for the radio, phone etc are functioning properly.  This is my college age daughter’s car and I fear the airbag won’t deploy in the event she was in a collision.
On October 3rd, 2021 the minder to change oil service came on and a wrench in the display. As the mechanic had set the incorrect timing interval between services, I went into the menu to attempt to reset the service minder but never got that far as the airbag light came on and all buttons on the steering wheel stopped responding. My husband in the passenger seat instructed me to restart the car and this did not reset any warnings but also showed the ACC: Error, in the display alternating with the Airbag: Error. The dealership wants $ 165 just to plug in the diagnostic reader and won't apply it to a repair and says this car has no open recalls which I am aware of. However, there was an airbag recall including the 2015 year build Passat, but the dealership wants payment to diagnose. When the car is stirred to make a 90 degree left hand turn I can hear a coil in the steering wheel cracking at times. Frequently, the airbag light for the passenger scale stays on but may go out if someone goes to sit in the passenger seat. All seat belts are unlocked at the top, and the receivers for the buckles look fine and nothing is stuck in them. I have not yet lifted the seats to inspect the harnesses but I doubt I will be able to fix anything as I cannot reset the codes anyhow.  Not being able to change the information on the instrument panel from useless Error Messages is distracting. Tell VW to read an airbag fault light for free! This is a safety concern for every passenger and should not be taken advantage of to make a service department money. How can I find out if this model was added to the air bag recalls or is in the process of being added? Honda has a lifetime warranty service for free on all safety restraints. I am surprised that VW does not make safety their highest priority. I'm not certain the Forward Collision Warning is affected but the lanes blink Orange showing me the ACC is not responsive and it's close enough in function to mention just in case it may not work.
2016 VW PASSAT.  DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR LATCH FREEZES SHUT IN TEMPERATURES BELOW FREEZING.  THE KEY-LESS ENTRY FOB UNLOCKS THE DOOR BUT THE DOOR CANNOT BE OPENED WHEN PULLING THE HANDLE.  ALSO, THE INSIDE HANDLE WILL NOT OPEN THE DOOR.  ALL OF THE OTHER DOOR LATCHES WORK NORMALLY.  WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE GOOD... NO ICE, SNOW OR FREEZING RAIN.  JUST THE TEMPERATURE IS BELOW FREEZING.      THIS IS A POTENTIAL LIFE THREATENING SAFETY ISSUE IF SOMEONE WERE TO DRIVE THE CAR AND NOT BE ABLE TO EXIT IN AN EMERGENCY.  IT IS POSSIBLE TO ENTER THE CAR FROM THE PASSENGER SIDE, SLIDE OVER TO THE DRIVER'S SIDE AND DRIVE THE CAR.    WHEN THE TEMPERATURE RISES ABOVE FREEZING, THE LATCH WORKS.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2016 VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT. WHILE DRIVING 50 MPH, THE VEHICLE LOST POWER WITHOUT WARNING AND WAS TOWED TO THE CONTACT'S RESIDENCE. THE CONTACT CALLED A LOCAL DEALER (AUDI BUFFALO, 5255 GENESEE ST, BOWMANSVILLE, NY 14026, (716) 683-3343), BUT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED AND INFORMED THE CONTACT TO HAVE THE VEHICLE DIAGNOSED AT A LOCAL DEALER. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 129,763.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2016 VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING AT 25 MPH, THE POWER STEERING AND THE POWER BRAKES SUDDENLY MALFUNCTIONED AND THE DRIVER WAS UNABLE TO IMMEDIATELY STEER OR STOP THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER WHO REPLACED THE CAMSHAFT. THE VEHICLE LATER EXPERIENCED THE SAME FAILURE AND THE DEALER REPLACED THE VACUUM PUMP. NO FURTHER INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE VIN WAS NOT AVAILABLE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 4,300.
The following warning lights will randomly turn on & off while driving: Air Bag Malfunction, ABS Brakes, ESC, Adaptive Cruise Control, Front collision, tire pressure, power steering, blind spot detection, low Key Battery detected, and indicate they are not functional. It is a random and items will go back to work while normally driving.  Key fob battery has been replaced multiple times...
While driving straight in dry weather (i.e. no rain), the lane light will change from – green – to – yellow – color in the dash and the steering wheel will jerk, usually left, sometimes right, very abruptly, as if the car is trying to find the lane with lane assist on. Note, this is on well marked city streets and on regular interstate roads with clearly marked dashed lane lines.  This has been happening for at least two months (today's date Dec. 12, 2021) and only now reporting this complaint. It did almost cause me to run into the car beside me several times or turn into the center median (trees) on city streets.
ON 1/12/21 WHILE TURNING INTO A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT I HEARD CLICKING IN THE STEERING COLUMN AND THEN THE AIR BAG LIGHT CAME ON AND ERROR CODES ACROSS THE DIGITAL SCREEN AND A CLOCK EMBLEM SIGNAL CAME ON. PULLED OVER AND LOOKED AT MY MANUAL. DROVE ON HOME AND DID RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT THE CLOCK SPRING IS A MAJOR ISSUE WITH VWS. I WENT BACK OUT TO TEST THE STEERING COLUMN AND SURE ENOUGH THE HORN AND ALL CONTROLS ON THE COLUMN DID NOT WORK. CALLED THE LOCAL VW DEALER THE NEXT DAY. THEY SAID THERE WAS A RECALL ON THIS 2017 PASSAT SEL MODEL. THEY REPLACED 6 DAYS LATER.
BLINDSPOT MONITORING SYSTEM ON LEFT SIDE OF CAR INTERMITTENT, CAPTURED INCIDENT ON VIDEO. WENT TO DEALER THREE TIMES FOR REPAIR, PROBLEM STILL PERSISTS. DEALER FALSIFIED REPAIR DOCUMENTATION ON ALL VISITS AND ADMITTED THE CAR WAS NOT TEST DRIVEN AS STATED ON THE INVOICE OF THE FIRST TWO VISITS. SENT DEMAND LETTER REQUESTING PERMANENT REPAIR TO VOLKSWAGEN, IT WAS RECEIVED ON 2JAN, RECEIVED NO REPLY. VOLKSWAGEN CORPORATE WILL NOT RETURN PHONE CALLS OR EMAILS. CAR IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE AND AFTER THIS SYSTEM ALMOST CAUSED A HIGH SPEED ACCIDENT ON 6JAN I REFUSE TO DRIVE IT. I HAVE ALL OF MY DOCUMENTATION AND COMMUNICATION WITH VOLKSWAGEN CORPORATE, IT IS WAY TOO MUCH TO ATTACH TO THIS COMPLAINT. THE DEALER, GULF COAST AUTO GROUP, FALSIFIED DOCUMENTS AND MADE NO EFFORT TO FIX A SAFETY RELATED SYSTEM AND VOLKSWAGEN CORPORATE HAS SENT ME PAPERWORK OFFERING TO BUY THE CAR BACK BUT WILL NOT RESPOND AFTER SENDING ME THE BUYBACK PAPERWORK. THIS 'BUYBACK' OF THE CAR IS AN ATTEMPT BY VOLKSWAGEN CORPORATE TO HIDE THE FACT THAT THEIR DEALER CONTINUALLY JEOPARDIZED MY SAFETY. AND AFTER SENDING THE BUYBACK PAPERWORK THEY WILL NOT RESPOND TO EMAILS AND PHONE CALLS. I HAVE BEEN WITHOUT MY CAR SINCE 6JAN, AND IT WILL NOT BE DRIVEN BY ME EVER AGAIN. I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF SOMEONE WOULD CONTACT ME REGARDING THIS MATTER SO I CAN SEND ALL OF MY DETAILED DOCUMENTATION FOR YOUR REVIEW.
LOUD AND ABRUPT THUD SOUND WHEN CHANGING GEARS IN 2017 VW PASSAT R-LINE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION MODEL. THIS LOUD THUD CAN BE HEARD EASILY WHEN CAR IS IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC AND CAN EVEN BE FELT AT THE BASE OF THE GAS PEDAL. HAPPENS MORE NOTICEABLY IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC WHEN DRIVING BETWEEN 20-40 MPH. MY CAR NOW HAS 5500 MILES ON IT BUT THIS LOUD THUD HAS BEEN HEARD SINCE THE DAY I BOUGHT THE CAR. I TOOK THE CAR TO REYDEL VW IN NEW JERSEY TO GET CHECKED BUT THE TECHNICIANS SAY THERE ARE NO ISSUES, EVEN THOUGH I KNOW I AM NOT CRAZY. I HAVE DRIVEN MANY OTHER PASSAT'S AND HAVE PREVIOUSLY OWNED 2014 VW JETTA WHICH NEVER MADE THIS LOUD THUD SOUND WHEN CHANGING GEARS.
The vehicle can be turned off while in drive, and gives no extra signals (beeps, flashing lights, etc.) with the exception of a brief message on the dash and single ding (same ding for door open, and other low importance messages). The vehicle will then roll until the brake is applied or it comes to a rest on a flat surface or against a pole or hard object.   This is a significant safety hazard that has occurred to me 3-4 times, the most recent was today when the vehicle rolled backwards down my mothers driveway.  Crossed the street, entered the neighbors driveway/yard, contacted the mail box and came to rest in the front yard.  The vehicle rolled approx. 200ft.   The vehicle is equipped with auto braking and parking collision warning, that are capable of sensing a collision while driving and notifying the driver of objects while parking. The same system should be able to prevent a car turned off while in drive from rolling uncontrolled and striking a person or object.  In addition the car should have generate a significant audio and visual warnings to the driver, furthermore the car should not be able to be turned off while in drive. It’s a fundamental flaw that it can be turned off, drivers door opened, driver and keys step out of the vehicle with no response from the vehicle.
MY VEHICLE ATTEMPTS TO STRAIGHTEN ITSELF OUT AS I'M GOING THROUGH A CURVE AND I ACTUALLY HAVE TO PUT MORE EFFORT THAN NECESSARY TO KEEP STEERING WHEEL APPROPRIATELY TURNED TO GO THROUGH THE CURVE ENTIRELY.  ALSO WHILE GOING THROUGH A CURVE, IF ATTEMPT TO SLOW DOWN, MY BRAKES SEEM TO MAKE SOME TYPE OF SCRAPING SOUND AND I CAN FEEL THE SCRAPE OR VIBRATION OF THE PROBLEM THROUGH THE PEDAL.  BOTH THESE ISSUES CAN AND HAVE OCCURRED WHILE TRAVELING AT A LOW SPEED SUCH AS 30 MPH OR AT HIGHER SPEED, SUCH AS 50-60 MPH.  I HAVE HAD A FEW CLOSE CALLS WITH OTHER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD DIE TO THESE ISSUES.  I WILL SPECIFY A DATE BECAUSE IT ASKS FOR A DATE BUT IT'S BEEN HAPPENING SINCE I FIRST PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.
My clock spring isn’t working after having my vehicle for barely a year. My air bag light is currently on. I can’t use my horn nor use any of the controls on my steering wheel. I’ve paid already 800 plus on previous car issues such as my harness hose. I’m still awaiting reimbursement. Further review and assistance needed.
Engine subframe catastrophic failure (left side) due to severe corrosion.  Lower control arm detached resulting in erratic handling and pulling.  Car unsafe to drive and expensive to repair at ~$2200.  Did research and found to be a very common complaint for 2010-2014.  Recall needs to be issued to replace corroded subframes.
About three years ago; there was a recall for the headlights. Subaru did replace the headlights, but I have replaced the headlights two additional times since then. And I currently have a headlight out a marker light out. I also last year had all of my marker lights burn out.
I WENT OUT TO START MY CAR AND LET IT WARM UP. I GOT IN SET THE ELECTRONIC PARKING BRAKE STARTED THE CAR AND PUT THE MANUAL TRANSMISSION IN NEUTRAL. I WENT IN THE HOUSE TO FINISH GETTING READY, WHEN I LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW THE CAR WAS IN THE DITCH AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DRIVEWAY. I HAD THE PARKING BRAKE RECALL DONE IN MARCH AT THE LOCAL SUBARU DEALER
VEHICLE HAS 116,567 MILES DEVELOPED A SQUEAKING NOISE AT 40 / 60 MPH.  AFTER BRINGING IN TO DEALER WAS ADVISED THE CVT CHAIN WAS SLIPPING AND ONLY THING THAT COULD BE DONE IS PURCHASE A NEW TRANSMISSION OR VEHICLE.  THE TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT WAS AT A COST OF 7900 DOLLARS AND NO OTHER OPTION WAS PROVIDED TO IMPROVE SAFETY IN THE VEHICLE.  I MADE NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TO HAVE SOA PROVIDE DETAILS ON WHAT MAINTENANCE COULD BE DONE TO TO PROTECT/EXTEND THE LIFE CYCLE OF THE FAILING TRANSMISSION OR IF THE TRANSMISSION COULD BE REBUILT TO IMPROVE SAFE OPERATION.  SOA RESPONSE CONTINUES TO BE THEY WILL DISCUSS A LOYALTY PROGRAM FOR A NEW LEASE OR CAR BUT THE ONLY OPTION IS TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION ENTIRELY.
DURING BRAKING, THE CAR OFTEN SHUTTERS AS IF IT IS GOING TO STALL, AND SEVERAL TIMES HAS STALLED COMPLETELY WHEN COMING TO A STOP. THIS OCCURS ESPECIALLY IF BRAKING HARD. THIS OCCURS ONLY WHEN THE CAR IS IN MOTION AND BEING BROUGHT TO A STOP. HOWEVER, WHEN IDLING, THE CAR OFTEN WILL SHUDDER AS WELL.
DASHBOARD WARNING LIGHTS GOING OFF. STARTS AS SOON AS THE VEHICLE TURNS ON. VERY RARELY DOES IT TURN OF. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS FLASHING, ANTI-SKID LIGHTS FLASHING, LOW TIRE PRESSURE LIGHTS FLASHING, CRUISE CONTROL LIGHTS FLASHING. HAVE TRIED MULTIPLE FIXES, BUT NOTHING WORKS. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR OVER 1 YEAR.
OCCASIONALLY THE 2.5 L ENGINE WITH CVT WILL APPEAR TO ALMOST STALL UPON DECELERATING AND COMING TO A STOP (AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT, STOP SIGN, ETC.).  THE ENGINE WILL SHUDDER,  THE RPMS WILL DROP BELOW 700 AND THEN QUICKLY RETURN TO NORMAL IDLE (ABOUT 800 OR SO).  HAVE NOT YET EXPERIENCED A STALL BUT HAVE COME CLOSE.  OUR CAR HAS ABOUT 87000 MILES AND IS OTHERWISE IN GOOD CONDITION.  OUR MECHANIC HAS BEEN UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THIS IS AN INTERMITTENT ISSUE, IT CANNOT BE DUPLICATED AND THERE ARE NO CODES. OTHER SIMILAR POSTS HAVE INDICATED THAT THE TORQUE CONVERTOR MAY BE THE CULPRIT. CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY OF POSTS, AN INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN.  STALLING CAN BE A SAFETY PROBLEM.
I BOUGHT THIS VECHICLE NEW IN 2010. SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE HAD TO CHANGE THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS 4 TIMES ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE AND 5 TIMES ON THE DRIVERS SIDE. I CONSIDER THIS A SAFETY HAZARD AS IT TAKES ALMOST 1 1/2 HOURS TO CHANGE THE BULB. YOU MUST REMOVE THE WHEEL, THE WHEEL WELL, THEN THE WATER PROOF COVER, THE SMALL RETAINING BRACKET AND THEN DISCONNECT THE BULB ALL THROUGH AN OPENING ONLY A CHILD HAND COULD FIT THROUGH EASILY.      I HAVE NEVER HAD BOTH LIGHTS GO OUT AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, ON A DARK MOUNTAIN ROAD THIS COULD BE LIFE THREATENING.  THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED WAS ONLY 3 MONTHS AFTER ACQUIRING THE VEHICLE AND THE LAST TIME WAS 2 WEEKS AGO.
DRIVING AND COMING TO A STOP.  AT STOP AND ENGINE IDLING, THE ENGINE MISFIRES (STUMBLES) ON OCCASION.  IT FEELS AS THOUGH THE ENGINE WILL DIE, BUT THEN IDLES NORMALLY.  THIS IS INTERMITTENT AND NO ENGINE LIGHT OR FAULT CODE COMES UP.  DEALER UNABLE TO CORRECT BECAUSE THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED WHEN THE CAR IS TAKEN IN FOR SERVICE.  I AM AFRAID THE CAR WILL STALL IN TRAFFIC.  THIS HAS OCCURRED OVER THE LAST 3-4 YEARS
THE BRAKE PIPES CORRODED IN THE SAME LOCATION AS IN THE EARLIER RECALL AT THE 4 CONNECTION COUPLING WHERE THE CENTER PIPE MEETS THE REAR PIPE SECTIONS.   THIS ISSUE IS DOCUMENTED IN SUBARU TICKET NUMBER 1-176 88494776.
BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT CYLINDER HEAD GASKETS DEFECTIVE (BLOWN). RIGHT HAND CYLINDER HEAD CRACKED.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 SUBARU OUTBACK. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 45 MPH, THE PASSENGER SIDE AIR BAG WARNING INDICATOR ILLUMINATED. THE FAILURE OCCURRED INTERMITTENTLY AT VARIOUS SPEEDS. THE DEALER STATED THAT THE SEAT PRESSURE SENSOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED AND THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 53,000. UPDATED 10/28/14 *BF
FOLLOWUP TO NHTSA ID NUMBER: 10525592  THE EFFECTED LOT NUMBER IS 0423SD (YEAR 2010, APRIL 23, LOCATION SD)  THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ORIGINAL EFFECTED LOCATION OF 9X13A OR EARLIER (OCT 13, 2009, LOCATION A AND EARLIER).  EXHIBITS THE SAME SYMPTOMS.    ORIGINAL COMPLAINT:  VEHICLE PADDLE SHIFTER FUNCTION, CRUISE CONTROL, HORN CONTROL ARE INTERMITTENT AND VOL UP AND MUTE RADIO FUNCTIONS DO NOT WORK ON THE STEERING COLUMN. THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER 10V283000. I WILL HAVE THE DEALER PROVIDE THE STEERING ROLL CONNECTOR LOT NUMBER TO DETERMINE IF MY VIN HAS AN OLDER STEERING COLUMN ON TUES. MY VIN IS OUTSIDE OF THE EFFECTED RANGE OF A*310001 TO A*377827. *TR
THE ENGINE STALLS WHILE AT A STOP OR COMING TO A STOP.  THE RPMS SUDDENLY DROP AND THE ENGINE STOPS.  CAR WILL RESTART AND OPERATE NORMALLY FOR A WHILE BUT THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN PERSISTENT AND IS OCCURRING MORE FREQUENTLY. THE DEALER COULD NOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO US. THE NEXT DAY, IT DID THE SAME THING. THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION ESPECIALLY WHEN MAKING A TURN AND EXPERIENCING A STALL, LOSS OF POWER STEERING, AND ACCELERATION.  *TR
TL*THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 SUBARU OUTBACK. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 30 MPH HE APPLIED PRESSURE TO THE BRAKE PEDAL.  HE TOOK HIS FOOT OFF OF THE BRAKE PEDAL BEFORE REACHING A STOP SIGN AND ATTEMPTED TO ACCELERATE.  THE VEHICLE MOMENTARILY HESITATED BEFORE ACCELERATING. THE FAILURE RECURRED  WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 30 MPH WHENEVER HE ATTEMPTED TO ACCELERATE AFTER APPLYING THE BRAKES. HE ALSO STATED THAT WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 75 MPH HE TOOK HIS FOOT OFF OF THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL BUT THE VEHICLE DID NOT BEGIN TO DECELERATE FOR APPROXIMATELY 4 SECONDS.  THIS FAILURE ALSO RECURRED WHENEVER HE WAS DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 75 MPH. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN AUTHORIZED DEALER WHERE HE WAS INFORMED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS MANUFACTURED TO OPERATE IN THAT MANNER. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 2,000 AND THE CURRENT MILEAGE WAS 8,000.
WHEN DOWNSHIFTING TO TURN OR WHEN SLOWING TO STOP, THE ENGINE REGULARLY SPUTTERS AND HAS DIED TWICE IN THE LAST MONTH CAUSING A LOSS OF POWER STEERING AND BRAKES.  IT ALSO HAPPENED ONCE WHILE I WAS TURNING LEFT INTO MY NEIGHBORHOOD.  LUCKILY THE CAR HAD ENOUGH RESIDUAL SPEED TO COMPLETE THE TURN AND NO TRAFFIC WAS APPROACHING.  THE CAR DOES NOT HAVE ANY ISSUE RESTARTING AFTER IT HAPPENS.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER THIS MORNING, 26 JULY 2010.  AFTER 2 HOURS, THEY SAID THEY KNOW OF THE PROBLEM, BUT COULD NOT "DOWNLOAD THE FIX". *TR
CAR DIES WHILE DRIVING AT A STEADY PACE, THEN SLOWING DOWN, ENGAGING THE CLUTCH AND LETTING THE CAR IDLE AT A LIGHT.  HAS HAPPENED 4 TIMES IN 2 WEEKS.  ONCE WAS WHILE DOWNSHIFTING TO 2ND GEAR TO COMPLETE A LEFT TURN.  HAD ENOUGH SPEED TO COMPLETE THE TURN, BUT DID NOT HAVE STEERING OR BRAKING ASSIST. *TR
MY 2010 SUBARU OUTBACK 2.5I LIMITED DEVELOPS UNSAFE STEERING AND HANDLING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. THE STEERING WHEEL SHAKES AND VIBRATES AND ALL STEERING FEEL IS LOST. WHEN THIS OCCURS, THIS CAR WANDERS AND, WITH THE ABSENCE OF STEERING FEEL AND THE SHAKING OF THE STEERING WHEEL, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP THE CAR'S DIRECTION STABLE. THIS IS A DEFINITE HAZARD IN HIGH SPEED DRIVING. AT LOWER SPEEDS THE STEERING AND HANDLING ARE FINE. REPEATED REBALANCING OF THE WHEELS HAS NOT FIXED THE PROBLEM. SWITCHING TO WINTER TIRES DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO VARY TO SOME EXTENT WITH SMALL CHANGES IN TIRE INFLATION ABOVE OR BELOW THE MANUFACTURER'S RECOMMENDATION, BUT IT CANNOT BE CURED BY PLAYING WITH TIRE PRESSURE. MY CAR WAS PURCHASED IN JULY 2009 AND THE STEERING AND HIGHWAY WANDERING PROBLEM HAS BEEN PRESENT SINCE THE BEGINNING. *TR
Going down the road and my breaks went to the floor, further inspection the back passenger 4 way block blew apart due to rust I looked online and there is so many of these cars the same year that this is happening to, would love to have this year and model included in the recall for breaks to get this fixed
The contact owns a 2011 Subaru Outback. The contact stated there was a clunking sound coming from the front suspension location and the vehicle started feeling unstable while driving approximately 30 MPH. The steering wheel began to sway towards the left causing the contact to use excessive force to steer the vehicle. There was no warning light illuminated. The contact took the vehicle to the dealer who diagnosed that the front subframe had fractured due to severe corrosion and needed to be replaced along with the front suspension. The front subframe and suspension was repaired; however, while doing so the dealer further diagnosed that the rear subframe and suspension had severe corrosion. The rear subframe and suspension was not repaired or replaced. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure and opened a case. The approximate failure mileage was 109,000.
Front control arm bolt pulled out of the subframe due to extreme corrosion.
When coming to a stop, the transmission's torque converter does not disengage, causing the engine to stall.  This was diagnosed by two independent  repair shops and there is an open TSB from Subaru that addresses this problem.  However, when slowing down at an intersection, the sudden stop can be dangerous.
VEHICLE SHUDDERS AND STALLS WHEN STOPPING. SUBARU ADMITS THERE'S A PROBLEM IN A SERVICE BULLETIN BUT REFUSES TO ISSUE A RECALL.
I PURCHASED THIS AS A USED VEHICLE AS IS WITH 130,000 MILES.  IT WAS WITHIN A COUPLES WEEKS THAT I NOTICED THE VEHICLE WOULD DIE EVERY TIME I WOULD BRAKE AT AN INTERSECTION OR STOP SIGN/LIGHT.  THANKFULLY, I LIVE IN A SMALL TOWN, BUT DO OCCASIONALLY TRAVEL TO LARGER CITIES.  AS YOU COULD IMAGINE, THIS IS QUITE DANGEROUS AT BUSY INTERSECTIONS!!!  I JUST RECENTLY HIT 135,000 MILES AND NOW HAVE ANOTHER ISSUE!  AT HIGHWAY SPEED, IT WILL INTERMITTENTLY HESITATE, THE RPM GAUGE JUMPS UP AND IT MAKES A SCREECHING NOISE.  AFTER RESEARCHING ON LINE, IT APPEARS THAT SEVERAL CONSUMERS HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT BOTH ISSUES. THEY ARE BOTH CAUSED BY A PROBLEM WITH THE CVT AND THAT SUBARU HAS MADE NO ATTEMPT TO CORRECT THE ISSUE?  I AM A MIDDLE-CLASS CONSUMER AND CAN NOT AFFORD A BRAND NEW VEHICLE, SO WHEN I DO PURCHASE A USED VEHICLE, I TRY TO FIND SOMETHING THAT HAS A HISTORY OF BEING RELIABLE AND LONG-LASTING.  THIS VEHICLE IS NEITHER!!!
I HAVE BEEN REPORTING PROBLEMS WITH MY TRANSMISSION SINCE 2012 TO MY REGULAR DEALERSHIP, STAR SUBARU WHEN THE CAR HAD JUST 23,472 MILES ON IT.  AT THIS POINT, I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE BEEN WRONGFULLY DENIED WARRANTY COVERAGE.     THEN AGAIN, IN 2017, WHILE STILL UNDER WARRANTY, I BROUGHT MY OUTBACK TO STAR SUBARU COMPLAINING THAT WHILE DRIVING SLOW, THE CAR TENDS TO 'JUMP' MID-DRIVE, ALMOST LIKE SOMEONE REAR ENDED YOU. THE CAR AT THIS POINT WAS AT ABOUT 94,467 MILES, UNDER THE 100,000 MILE WARRANTY LIMIT.   AFTER NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS I FINALLY RECEIVED A TEST DRIVE WITH A SUBARU MECHANIC AT STAR SUBARU IN BAYSIDE, QUEENS, NY. HE CONCLUDED THAT IT NEEDED TRANSMISSION PARTS, A TORQUE CONVERTER/VALVE BODY.    AT THAT POINT I WAS SET TO HAVE IT REPLACED ONCE THE PARTS CAME IN.   WEEKS WENT BY AND I HEARD NOTHING. I CONTACTED SUBARU OF AMERICA WHO WAS ABLE TO SET ME UP WITH EAST HILLS SUBARU. THE SOA PERSON WAS VERY HELPFUL WITH THE TRANSITION. THEY PERFORMED THEIR OWN DIAGNOSTIC, AND THE CONDITION AT THE TIME WOULD NOT REPLICATE.  UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN THIS 'JUMP/SLAM' HAPPENS, IT DOES SPONTANEOUSLY.  WE CANNOT MAKE IT HAPPEN, NOR DO WE EVEN KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. IT WAS ALWAYS VERY SPORADIC.  SOMETIMES IT WOULD HAPPEN ON THE HIGHWAY GOING 65, OR SOMETIMES LESS THAN 5MPH.    ON A LONG TRIP BACK FROM VERMONT, THERE WOULD BE A LARGE REVVING SOUND, AND THEN IT FELT AS IF SOMEONE HIT US FROM BEHIND. ONCE AGAIN, I TOOK THE CAR TO SUBARU, ONLY TO BE TOLD THEY SIMPLY COULDN'T 'REPLICATE THE PROBLEM', AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING TO HELP US. ON APRIL 3RD 2019, I BRING MY CAR IN AGAIN TO EAST HILL SUBARU. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON. THEY DO RECALL. THEY ALSO TROUBLESHOOT THE CHECK ENGINE CODE, WHICH NOW COMES UP CLEARLY AS P1710 TORQUE CONVERTER TURBINE 2 SPEED SIGNAL CIRCUIT MALFUNCTION. NOW IT'S NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.THE PRICE TAG IS VERY HIGH, ALMOST $6,000!  *TR
TSB WAS ISSUED FOR THIS DEFECTIVE TORQUE CONVERTER. ORIGINAL WARRANTY WAS EXTENDED, BUT VEHICLE IS NOW OUT OF WARRANTY EXTENSION. SUBARU DENIED MY REQUEST TO FIX THEIR DESIGN FLAW AS DOCUMENTED IN SERVICE BULLETIN # 16-90-13R.    THE CAR ENGINE SHUTS OFF WHEN APPLYING THE BRAKES - THUS CREATING A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE.
WE'VE ATTEMPTED TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE WITH SUBARU AMERICA, BUT THEY DON'T RESPOND. 2011 PURCHASED NEW SUBARU OUTBACK. ALL REQUIRED SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE & SERVICES PERFORMED ON TIME AT AUTHORIZED PROVIDER.    2019 THE TIMING BELT, WATER PUMP AND THERMOSTAT REPLACED PER MFG STDS. DEALER ADDED COOLANT & BLED THE SYSTEM. 3 MONTHS LATER THE RADIATOR BLEW. A CHEMICAL BLOCK WAS DONE & ALL WAS FINE PER DEALER. 3 MONTHS LATER ENGINE OVERHEATED. ANOTHER DEALERSHIP DISCOVERED THE HEAD GASKET & CAT WERE CRACKED WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED BY THE PREVIOUS DEALER. SUBARUS ARE NOTORIOUS FOR HEAD GASKET & COOLANT SYSTEM ISSUES FROM 100,000 ' 120,000 MILES. SUBARU SLIGHTLY REDESIGNED THE HEAD GASKETS, BUT THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE IS AWARE THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS.   THE PROBLEMS WITH THE HEAD GASKET, CAT AND RADIATOR ARE WELL DOCUMENTED ON THE INTERNET FOR 1990 TO 2011 MODELS. ISSUE STEMS FROM MANAGEMENT DECISION TO UTILIZE A COMPOSITE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAD GASKET TO SAVE MONEY; HOWEVER, THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF HEAT ON COMPOSITE METAL PRODUCTS WOULD SURMISE THIS WOULD LEAD TO WARPING, CRACKING OR OTHER RELATED PRODUCT FAILURES. THE DESIGN & CONSTRUCTION OF THE SUBARU HEAD GASKET WAS INEPT AT BEST.  THE DEVICE FEATURES A MULTI-LAYER STEEL SHIM COATED WITH A GRAPHITE LAYER. IT WAS NOT UP-TO-THE-MARK & ALLOWED COOLANT TO LEAK INTO THE EXHAUST PRESSURE &/OR COMBUSTION CHAMBER. THERE WAS NO SUBARU HEAD GASKET RECALL BUT THE COMPANY REDESIGNED THE CYLINDER HEADS & CONFIGURATIONS OF THE CAMSHAFT. HOWEVER, IT ONLY LED TO THE COOLANT A&ND OIL LEAK AT THE EXTERNAL HEAD GASKET. THIS SYSTEM DEFECT ADDS TO THE COOLANT SYSTEM FAILURE NOTED.  WE REQUEST SUBARU AMERICA REIMBURSE US FOR THE TOTAL COST OF THE RADIATOR, THERMOSTAT & HEAD GASKET REPLACEMENT AT $4,013.80. PLUS OTHER COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE BREAKDOWNS AT $1,236.20 FOR A TOTAL OF $5,250.00
AROUND 130,000 MILES CAR BEGAN TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH SHUDDERING -  WILL SOMETIMES SHUDDER AND STALL WHEN COMING TO A STOP. VERY DANGEROUS AT INTERSECTIONS WHEN SLOWING DOWN TO TURN AND IN TRAFFIC. CONCERNED THAT THIS COULD RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT- BEING HIT OR STALLING IN THE PATH OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC. IN RESEARCHING ON THE INTERNET IT APPEARS THAT SUBARU OUTBACKS FROM 2010-2015 ARE EXPERIENCING THIS AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO RECALLS NOR ANY WARRANTIES TO COVER REPAIRS. REPAIRS TO TORQUE CONVERTER CLUTCH - WHICH IS INDICATED BY MY DEALERSHIP CAN RUN UPWARDS OF $1500.
TL* TAKATA RECALL. THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 SUBARU OUTBACK. THE CONTACT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 19V009000 (AIR BAGS). THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE MANUFACTURER EXCEEDED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THE RECALL REPAIR. SUBARU OF ROCHESTER (LOCATED AT 4840 MAINE AVE SE, ROCHESTER, MN 55904, (507) 285-4777) WAS CONTACTED AND CONFIRMED THAT THE PART WAS NOT AVAILABLE. AN APPOINTMENT WAS MADE FOR MAY OF 2019 TO HAVE THE VEHICLE REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE ISSUE. THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE. PARTS DISTRIBUTION DISCONNECT.
ENGINE STALLS IF STOP ABRUPTLY. CAR SHUDDERS ON ACCELERATION AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND UP HILLS WHEN ATTEMPTING TO ACCELERATE. THERE APPEARS TO A BULLETIN 16-90-13R BUT IT SHOULD BE A RECALL. SUBARU SHOULD COVER THE COST OF THE REPAIR FOR THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE.
RECENTLY WHILE BRAKING HARD, MY CAR SHUDDERS AND STALLS.  IT HAS HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY AND ON SIDE STREETS. IT CAN ALSO HAPPEN WITH REGULAR TO LIGHT BRAKING ESPECIALLY IF IT IS COLD. AFTER DIAGNOSING MY ISSUE, MY MECHANIC PRODUCED THE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN 16-90-13R WHICH DETAILS THE PROBLEM OCCURRING. HE AND SUBARU CONFIRMED THE REPAIR IS AT LEAST $6100. WHEN I CALLED SUBARU CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY TOLD ME THAT LETTERS WENT OUT TO ALL OWNERS LAST YEAR, BUT I NEVER RECEIVED THE LETTER, AND OF COURSE I AM PAST THE JULY 31, 2018 DEADLINE,SO THEY SAY I AM OUT OF WARRANTY. I HAVE SPOKEN TO CUSTOMER SERVICE SEVERAL TIMES AND AM NOW CONSULTING WITH MY DEALER TO SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO FOR ME. I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RECALL AND NOT A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN TO DEALERS AND A NOTICE TO OWNERS. I AM ALSO MAILING A CERTIFIED LETTER TO THOMAS J. DOLL, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF SUBARU OF AMERICA, INC. DETAILING MY SITUATION AND MY CONCERNS. I AM ATTACHING A COPY OF THE NOTICE TO OWNERS AND THE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN MY MECHANIC PRINTED FOR ME.  *JS
TORQUE CONVERTER  ISSUE
I HAVE REPLACE ALL EXTERIOR LIGHTS MULTIPLE TIMES OVER THE 6 YEARS I HAVE OWN THIS CAR.
TAKATA RECALL :  MULTIPLE DEALERS HAVE REPORTED THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE PARTS TO FIX THIS AIRBAG RECALL.  I HAVE TAKEN IT TO MORE THAN ONE DEALER IN MORE THAN ONE CITY WHO HAS GIVEN ME THE SAME RESPONSE.  I AM CURRENTLY DRIVING AROUND WITH THESE FAULTY AIRBAGS WHICH POTENTIALLY COULD HARM ME IN THE CASE OF AN ACCIDENT.  I WOULD LIKE THEM REPLACED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
MY 2011 SUBARU OUTBACK IS EXPERIENCING SHUDDERING & STALLS WHEN COMING TO A STOP RESULTING IN THE ENGINE SHUTTING OFF.  IT OCCURS RANDOMLY, AND NEARLY GOT IN ACCIDENTS WITH DRIVERS BEHIND ME HAVING TO REACT TO THE SUDDEN FULL STOPS. THE VEHICLE IS AT A SUBARU DEALERSHIP NOW FOR REPAIRS. THERE IS A SUBARU TECHNICAL BULLETIN #16-90-13R REGARDING A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THE TORQUE CONVERTER: "2010-12 MY LEGACY AND OUTBACK MODELS EQUIPPED WITH CVT TRANSMISSION", SUBJECT "DESIGN CHANGE TO LOCK-UP TYPE TORQUE CONVERTER".  GIVEN THE DANGER OF RANDOM STALLING EVENTS, THE NUMBER OF REPORTED INCIDENTS, AND THE ~$1500 REPAIR EXPENSE BEING PUT ON THE CONSUMER FOR A KNOWN DESIGN PROBLEM, THIS SHOULD BE STRONGLY CONSIDERED FOR A RECALL.
I RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM SUBARU TODAY THAT PARTS ARE NOW AVAILABLE TO REMEDY THIS AIR BAG DEFECT.  WHEN I CALLED MY DEALER, I WAS TOLD THAT SUBARU WILL ONLY SHIP A FEW PARTS AT A TIME.  THERE ARE 18 ON THEIR WAITING LIST FOR THESE PARTS.  SOME HAVE BEEN WAITING 6 MONTHS.  WHY DOESN'T SUBARU SHIP THE PARTS NEEDED TO MAKE NEEDED REPAIRS?  THE NOTICE FROM SUBARU SAYS NOT TO ALLOW PASSENGERS TO RIDE IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT UNTIL THIS REPAIR IS PERFORMED.
THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS BURN OUT EVER 8-10 MONTHS. NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF BULB USED, THE LOW BEAM BULB OVERHEATS AND BURNS ITSELF OUT FASTER THAN ANY OTHER CAR.
SUBARU HAS A KNOWN TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN 16-90-13R THAT IDENTIFIES AN ISSUE THE THE TORQUE CONVERTER THAT IS CAUSING SUBARU VEHICLES TO STALL WHEN BREAKING.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT MUST BE FIXED IN ORDER TO AVOID ACCIDENTS WHILE DRIVING.  DESPITE BEING A KNOWN SAFETY ISSUE, SUBARU HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL.  RATHER SUBARU OWNERS ARE LEFT TO PAY THE $1500 COST OF CORRECTING THE TORQUE CONVERTER ISSUE.  MY 2011 SUBARU OUTBACK IS STALLING OUT WHEN BRAKING AT INTERSECTIONS AND PAR.
RIGHT BACK BRAKE LIGHT BLEW OUT.  CAR HAS BEEN HAVING ALOT OF VARIOUS LIGHTING PROBLEMS SINCE PURCHASED IN 2011.  NOT SURE WHEN IT BLEW OUT, SOMEONE IN A PARKING LOT TOLD ME IT WAS OUT.
WE HAVE OWNED THIS SUBARU SINCE NEW. THE ORIGINAL HEADLIGHT BULBS BURNT OUT AT 58,000 MILES. SINCE THEN I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THE BULBS EVERY TWO TO THREE MONTHS, USING THE SUBARU RECOMMENDED H7 BULBS FROM SYLVANIA. THE CAR HAS BURNT THROUGH AT LEAST ONE DOZEN LIGHT BULBS.
VEHICLE STALLS WHEN BRAKING HARD WHEN COMING TO A STOP.
OUR 2011 SUBARU OUTBACK HAS HAD AN EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF HEADLIGHT BULBS BURN OUT OVER THE PAST 18 MONTHS.  OVER THE PAST 18 MONTHS I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE 4 HEADLIGHT BULBS, 2 DRIVER SIDE AND 2 PASSENGER SIDE.  THEY HAVE ALL OCCURRED AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND THE VEHICLE HAS NEVER BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT.  THIS IS BECOMING A SAFETY ISSUE WITH THE VEHICLE AND A COSTLY REPAIR.  THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN THE DESIGN OF THE AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHT SYSTEM DESIGN WHICH IS CAUSING THESE FAILURES.
AT A HARD, FAST BRAKE TO AVOID TRAFFIC CONGESTION ON THE FREEWAY, THE CAR STALLED AND DIED. IT LOST ALL POWER AND HAD TO BE RESTARTED. A FAULTY TORQUE CONVERTER IS THE CULPRIT. THE TORQUE CONVERTER FAILURE IN THE SUBARU (NOT JUST OUTBACKS) HAS BEEN SHOWN TO RESULT IN A SUDDEN LOSS OF POWER / STALLED ENGINE, WHICH CAN ENDANGER THE DRIVER AND OTHER DRIVERS.   *TR
WITH NO PASSENGER SEATED, THE SEAT BELT CHIME STARTED RINGING. TO TRY TO STOP IT, I LATCHED THE PASSENGER SEAT BELT. CHIMING CONTINUED. I NOTICE THE AIR BAG WARNING LIGHT WAS LIT. I DROVE THE CAR STRAIGHT TO MY SUBARU DEALER AND WAS TOLD THE PASSENGER SIDE AIR BAG SENSOR HAD FAILED. I WAS ALSO TOLD THE ONLY WAY TO FIX IT WAS TO REPLACE THE SEAT AT WELL OVER $1000. I WAS STILL LEFT WITH THE PROBLEM OF THE SEAT BELT CHIME. THE DEALERSHIP WOULDN'T DISABLE THE CHIME SO I SEARCHED THE INTERNET FOR A SOLUTION. WHAT I FOUND IS THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH 2011 OUTBACKS. I DID ALSO FIND OUT HOW TO DISABLE THE SEAT BELT CHIME. BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH A COSTLY REPAIR AND A COMMON PROBLEM, I HAVE TO BELIEVE THERE ARE MANY SUBARU OWNERS DRIVING AROUND WITH UNPROTECTED PASSENGERS HAVING DISABLING THEIR SEAT BELT CHIMES AND HAVING NO AIR BAG PROTECTION.    IN FAIRNESS TO SUBARU, I CONTACTED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY OFFERED TO SPLIT THE COST OF THE REPAIR. IT WILL STILL COST ME $798 FOR WHAT SHOULD BE A SIMPLE REPAIR BUT BECAUSE OF POOR ENGINEERING, A REPLACEMENT SEAT.    I WOULD APPRECIATE YOU LOOKING INTO THIS MATTER.  *TR
1ST INCIDENT 1/10/2014- LEAVING A STOP LIGHT CAR WOULD NOT ACCELERATE AND VDC, CEL AND BRAKE LIGHT FLASHING. SAT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR ABOUT 1/2 HOUR. HUSBAND CAME TO PICK US UP AND TRIED STARTING THE CAR. THE CAR STARTED AND WAS ABLE TO DRIVE W/O FURTHER ISSUE. CHECK CODES AND HAD MISFIRE CYC 1,2,3,4. LOCAL MECHANIC COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG CLEARED CODES. HUSBAND NOTICED BOTH DRL LIGHTS WERE BLOWN. REPLACED BOTH AND WHEN THE KEY WAS TURNED ON (NOT STARTED) HEARD A LOUD SQUEALING ELECTRICAL NOISE FROM THE AREA OF THE ALTERNATOR/POWER STEERING PUMP WHERE THE ELECTRICAL HARNESS IS BOLTED TO THE TOP OF THE ENGINE. STARTED THE CAR AND IT DROVE FINE FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS.    2ND INCIDENT 1/14/2014 - PULLING AWAY FROM A FRIENDS HOUSE VDC AND CEL LIGHTS COME ON. TURN OFF CAR AND SIT FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES. START CAR ALL WARNING LIGHTS GONE AND CAR DROVE FINE. HUSBAND CHECKED CODES AND FOUND MISFIRE CYC 1,2 ONLY    3RD INCIDENT 1/30/2014 - LEAVING STOP LIGHT AND VDC LIGHT COMES ON AND CAR WILL ONLY GO ABOUT 3 MILES PER HOUR ENOUGH TO GET IT OFF ROAD AND ENGINE STALLS. NO CEL THIS TIME. SIT FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES START CAR AND IT DRIVES FINE AND ALL LIGHTS GONE. REPLACED THE BATTERY AND HAD MECHANIC CLEAN OUT THE ABS BRAKE SENSORS.    SUBARU AMERICA AND OUR DEALERSHIP WHERE WE BOUGHT THE CAR ARE AWARE AND CAN FIND NOTHING WRONG.  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2011 SUBARU OUTBACK. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE BRAKING, THE TRACTION CONTROL AND ABS SYSTEM WARNING LIGHTS ILLUMINATED. THE ENGINE MADE A KNOCKING NOISE AND VEHICLE WOULD NOT ACCELERATE OVER 5 MPH.  THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER SEVERAL TIMES FOR THE FAILURE AND A DIAGNOSTIC WAS PERFORMED THAT WAS UNABLE TO GENERATE A FAILURE CODE. THE DEALER REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION DRIVE BELT HOWEVER, THE FAILURE WAS NOT CORRECTED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE DEALER FOR FURTHER INSPECTION. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 55,000 AND THE CURRENT MILEAGE WAS 60,000.
I BELIEVE MY ANTI-LOCK BRAKES MALFUNCTIONED ON MY 2011 SUBARU OUTBACK AND IF THIS IS THE CASE THEN SOMEONE IN AUTO SAFETY DATA COLLECTION NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT IT.  I WAS DRIVING DOWN AN OFF RAMP DURING SNOWY CONDITIONS.  I APPLIED MY BRAKES AT AROUND 35 MPH AND THEY ABRUPTLY LOCKED UP.  THERE WAS NO SHUTTER/SHIMMER EFFECT THAT I MIGHT EXPECT WITH ANTI-LOCK BRAKES AS THEY GO ON AND OFF WHILE TRYING TO GRIP THE ROAD.  I APPLIED THEM AGAIN WITH THE SAME JOLT FOLLOWED BY SLIDING.  I TRIED THIS SEVERAL TIMES AS I APPROACHED THE INTERSECTION.  THOUGH THE LONG OFF RAMP DID SLOW ME DOWN, AT ABOUT 15 MPH (I THINK) I PLOWED THE LEFT FRONT OF MY CAR INTO THE FORD RANGER IN FRONT OF ME.  THIS IMPRESSIVELY CRUSHED THE LEFT FRONT SIDE OF MY CAR AND MY AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.  THE POINT OF IMPACT WAS THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FRONT BUMPER, BUT IT HIT AT THE UPPER 2-3 INCHES OF THE BUMPER.  I'M NOT SURE IF THE AIRBAGS SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED WITH THIS TYPE OF IMPACT, BUT IF THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DEPLOY THEN SOMEONE NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT IT TOO.  *TR
MY WIFE LEFT THE HOUSE AND SMELLED SMOKE.  SHE PULLED OVER AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER FLAMES STARTED SHOOTING OUT OF THE HOOD.  SHE GOT OUR DAUGHTER OUT OF THE CAR AND CALLED 911.  AS THE POLICE ARRIVED, ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS PUT THE FIRE OUT WITH AN EXTINGUISHER.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED AND LOOKED AT THE DAMAGE AND SAID THE WIPER MOTOR OVERHEATED AND CAUSED THE FIRE.   MY WIFE WAS QUITE UPSET AT THE THOUGHT OUR LITTLE GIRL COULD OF BURNED IN THE CAR.
THIS IS PART 2 OF ORIGINAL COMPLAINT # 10422477.  SINCE I HAVE A 2ND DEFECTIVE TIRE. *TR
2011 SUBARU OUTBACK 3.6R - CAR HAS VIBRATION THAT CAN BE MOSTLY FELT IN THE STEERING WHEEL AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. VIBRATION CAN ALSO BE FELT IN THE SEATS AND FLOOR. VIBRATION COMES AND GOES AT VARIOUS SPEEDS. *TR
When coming to a stop, the car shudders and often stalls just like if you didn't press in the clutch on a manual transmission. No warning lights or messages. See details in TSB- 16-90-13R. Subaru knows about this issue and it has been reported in many vehicles. My car was at a Subaru dealership at least half a dozen times during 2017-2018 when this issue came to light and no one notified us to have it checked. Fast forward to now and for the last year my car has been shuddering when coming to a stop, and about 2-3 months ago, it started stalling. This is an absolute safety issue and should be a recall.  I've been in many situations where it stalls and I am vulnerable to getting rear-ended because it takes time to restart the car and get moving again. This is particularly true in traffic or situations where you need to stop suddenly and others behind you are not anticipating you being stopped in the roadway.
The contact owns a 2012 Subaru Outback. The contact stated while entering the vehicle, it was discovered that rainwater had leaked into the vehicle from the sunroof. The contact stated that the failure had occurred on six separate occasions. The vehicle was taken to the local dealer who determined that the cause of the failure was due to the sunroof drainage tubes being clogged with debris. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure, but no assistance was offered. The contact stated that an unknown TSB addressing the failure had been issued by the manufacturer. The failure mileage was 16,781.
This summer, my 2012 Subaru Outback began shuddering and stalling when slowing down. This has happened approaching stop signs and stop lights, but has also happened going up steep hills and on the highway as traffic slows. Cars behind me have gotten incredibly close, and it seems only a matter of time before an accident occurs. We brought the car to the mechanic, who told us it was the torque converter, which would cost upwards of $5000 to replace.  Subaru extended the warranty on 2010 - 2015 Outbacks because of the faulty torque converter - but the warranty expires at 100,000 miles, which we've surpassed. I'm not sure how this works - the manufacturer had a defect but we're responsible? It's scary when the car stalls out and I'm not sure it's safe to continue driving the vehicle. Our mechanic said the issue would get worse over time.
THE VEHICLE STALLS COMPLETELY UPON SLOWING DOWN.  THIS OCCURS FREQUENTLY AT STOP SIGNS, LIGHTS AND WHILE CROSSING A MAJOR ROAD AND WAITING HALFWAY ACROSS TO JOIN THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC.  SUBARU DEALER SAYS IT IS A DEFECTIVE TORQUE CONVERTER BUT NO LONGER COVERED BY THE CVT WARRANTY EXTENSION.  THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND SHOULD BE FIXED AT NO COST TO VEHICLE OWNER.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 SUBARU OUTBACK. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE BULBS IN THE HEADLAMPS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED QUITE FREQUENTLY. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO MILLER SUBARU (1592 NJ-38, LUMBERTON, NJ 08048) HOWEVER, THE CONTACT WAS UNSURE IF A DIAGNOSTIC TEST WAS PERFORMED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 175,000.
MY 2012 SUBARU OUTBACK ENGINE WILL SHUT OFF WHEN COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP WHEN EXITING A FREEWAY, COMING TO A STOP ON A SIDE STREET. SPEED DOES NOT PLAY A FACTOR IN THIS. THIS HAPPENS INTERMITTENTLY AND CLEARLY, IS A SAFETY ISSUE! I NEVER RECEIVED A NOTIFICATION ON THIS MATTER FROM SUBARU THAT THERE IS A KNOWN DEFECT WITH THE TORQUE CONVERTER IN THE TRANSMISSION. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND STILL SHOULD BE A RECALL. FATALITIES COULD BE A RESULT OF THIS!  SUBARU NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND NOT JUST BY EXTENDING THE WARRANTY.  AGAIN THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISUUE!
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 SUBARU OUTBACK. THE CONTACT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 19V009000 (AIR BAGS). THE PARTS TO DO THE REPAIR WERE UNAVAILABLE. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE MANUFACTURER EXCEEDED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THE RECALL REPAIR. COMPETITION SUBARU SMITH TOWN (601 MIDDLE COUNTRY RD, ST JAMES, NY 11780, (631) 361-4500) WAS CONTACTED AND STATED THAT THE PARTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE RECALL REMEDY. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND WAS NOT ABLE TO CONFIRM WHEN THE PARTS WERE TO BECOME AVAILABLE. THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE. PARTS DISTRIBUTION DISCONNECT.
WHILE SLOWING DOWN THE VEHICLE HAS PULLED (FEELING LIKE IT IS NOT SHIFTING DOWN ,  FOR YEARS,  THOUGHT IT WAS THE NATURE OF THE BEAST) SO HAD TO BRAKE HARDER. SINCE THE SUMMER OF 2018 THE CAR PULLS AND SOMETIMES STALLS OR ALMOST STALLS WHEN DECELERATING FAST.  THIS HAPPENS ON HIGHWAY AND ALSO CITY (BETWEEN STREETLIGHTS). I LOOKED ONLINE AND SEE THAT SUBARU HAS HAD A BULLETIN SINCE 2014 KNOWING ABOUT A THRUST WASHER WEAR PROBLEM INSIDE THE TORQUE CONVERTER .   1-27-2019  I TOOK THE OUTBACK IN FOR SERVICE AND THE DIAGNOSIS WAS TORQUE CONVERTER REPLACEMENT. ESTIMATED COST FOR REPAIRS $1715.00.      MY WIFE AND I NOT ONLY HAD THE STANDARD SUBARU WARRANTY BUT PAID EXTRA FOR THE EXTENDED WARRANTY,.  ALL SERVICE WAS DONE AT THE SUBARU DEALERSHIP ( STANLEY SUBARU ) AND THE LAST SERVICE BEFORE WARRANTY EXPIRED IN 2017 I SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR THE CAR TO BE GONE THOUGH WITH A FINE TOOTH COMB (AT THAT TIME WE WAS CONCERNED WITH NOISY WHEEL BEARINGS.    NO MENTION OF THE BULLETIN ON THE TORQUE CONVERTER WAS MENTIONED.  *TR
BRAKE WARNING LIGHT FLASHES ABOUT EVERY SECOND OR THIRD TIME YOU START CAR. ST AUSTIN FLASHING
VEHICLE STALLING WHILE STOPPING OR ATTEMPTING TO ACCELERATE FROM A STOP. THERE IS A WARRANTY EXTENSION ON THE CVT TRANSMISSION, BUT ONLY TO 100,000 MILES FROM SUBARU.  THIS PROBLEM SHOULD BE A RECALL, NOT ONLY A WARRANTY EXTENSION.  IT IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY PROBLEM THAT COULD EASILY RESULT IN COLLISION WITH INJURY OR DEATH.  VEHICLE STALLING WHEN SLOWING DOWN OR ACCELERATING FROM A STOP.
FAILURE OF THE TORQUE CONVERTER CAUSED TRANSMISSION FAILURE AND REQUIRED A COMPLETE OVERHAUL AT 82511. I WAS NOT INFORMED BY THE DEALERSHIP THERE WAS A SERVICE BULLETIN BY THE DEALERSHIP.
TL* TAKATA RECALL. THE CONTACT OWNS A 2012 SUBARU OUTBACK. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 35 MPH, ANOTHER VEHICLE CRASHED INTO THE FRONT DRIVER SIDE OF THE CONTACT'S VEHICLE AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THE AIR BAGS FAILED TO DEPLOY. THE DRIVER SUSTAINED PAINS TO THE NECK, CHIN, AND COLLAR BONE. THE AIR BAGS FAILED TO DEPLOY. THE CONTACT RECEIVED MEDICAL TREATMENT. A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO A YARD BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY. THE VIN WAS INCLUDED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 17V014000 (AIR BAGS), BUT THE CONTACT WAS NOT AWARE OF THE RECALL. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 72,000. PARTS DISTRIBUTION DISCONNECT.
CAR HAD FIRE AT STARTER WITH LOTS OF SMOKE COMING FROM TRANSMISSION AND ALTERNATOR .VEHILCE HAD BEEN HAVING SHIFTING ISSUES AND TRACTION FROM ALL WHEEL DRIVE NOT WORKING. I HAD VEHICLE TAKEN TO DIFFERENT DEALERS BUT NO ONE WAS ABLE TO FIX PROBLEM UNTIL THE DAY CAR CAUGHT FIRE WHICH TOLD THEM WHICH PARTS WHERE AT FAULT. MY VEHICLE IS TRUELY A LEMON, FOR IT HAS BEEN ONE PROBLEM AFTER ANOTHER FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS
THIS VEHICLE HAS ONE OWNER, WHICH IS ME, AND THE TRANSMISSION, DOWNSHIFTS AND SKIPS  A GEAR WHEN COLD AND ALMOST CAUSED AN ACCIDENT. PEOPLE WERE ALMOST INJURED AND SOMEONE COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.    WHEN THE TRANSMISSION IS COLD, AND ON A FREEWAY AND THAN EXITING, AND SLOWING DOWN TO 35 TO 45 MPH ON EXIT THE CAR TRANSMISSION KICKS AND LIKE SOMEONE IS HITTING YOU IN THE BACK, AND SKIPS A GEAR. SUBARU HAS A PROBLEM WITH THIS CAR AND THEY NEED TO ADDRESS. TOOK IT TO THE DEALER THEY REPROGRAMMED THE TRANSMISSION DID NOT WORK. I WILL BE FILING LEMON LAW IN MY NEXT TWO VISITS IF IT IS NOT FIXED.  *TR
DROVE THE CAR FOR APPROXIMATELY 45 MINUTES, MADE A QUICK STOP WITH CAR TURN OFF, WHEN RESTARTING CAR, AIR BAG WARNING LIGHT CAME ON AND ALSO THE PASSENGER SIDE AIR BAG LIGHT SAID IT WAS OFF EVEN THOUGHT THEIR WAS AN ADULT PASSENGER ON THAT SIDE OF THE CAR.  LIGHT STAYED ON EVEN AFTER RESTARTING CAR, READJUSTING SEATBELTS, ETC.  DROVE WITH WARNING LIGHT ON FOR ABOUT AN HOUR, STOPPED FOR A MINUTE, TURNED OFF CAR AND WHEN STARTING CAR, THE WARNING LIGHT WAS OFF AND THE PASSENGER SIDE AIR BAG SAID IT WAS ON.  TOOK TO DEALER NEXT DAY, GOT CODE DTC29.  OCCUPANCY DETECTION SYSTEM GOT RECALIBRATED AND ZEROED AND DID NOT COME BACK ON.  *TT
At all speeds vehicle shudders when letting off accelerator then nearly stalls. This is extremely dangerous when entering expressways or crossing oncoming vehicles. Dealer identified transmission as the problem and could reproduce, but not determine reason. Said drive until Check Engine light comes on then bring back. Light has never lit up. Dealer says Subaru stopped using this transmission because of problems, but is not allowed to rebuild or repair transmission. Says it cannot get new or rebuilt transmission from Subaru or anyone else just from totaled car auction. Dealership is offering $2500 trade in. This problem is well documented online regarding 2013 Subaru Outback’s with 2.5L engine.
Vehicle horn has failed to function.
Upon entering a parking space,my 2013 Subaru Outback went from idle to full acceleration,hitting a parked,unoccupied truck. Braking had no effect on the car,the air bag did not deploy,and the car did not decelerate until I was able to engage Park-within a few seconds it resumed the idle.  The police made a report,car was taken to wrecking yard,and is now at repair facility for possible repair. There were no prior warnings or messages.  I was unaware of a safety issue with Subaru and when I contacted my local dealer,I was told they were unaware of any issues.  I then did research online and found numerous problems.
FOR THE LAST 50K MILES, OIL CONSUMPTION HAS GOTTEN WORSE AND WORSE.  NOW IT NEEDS A QT OF OIL EVERY 600 MILES.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 SUBARU OUTBACK. WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED AT A FUEL STATION, THE EMERGENCY BRAKE FAILED TO RELEASE AND THE EYESIGHT COLLISION WARNING FAILED TO ACTIVATE. THE CONSUMER STATED PARKING ACCELERATOR BRAKE FAILED AND DEALER REPAIRED AT NO CHARGE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 66,600. *TT *TR
TAKATA RECALL - CARTER SUBARU, BALLARD, SEATTLE, WA (98117) - CALLED THE DAY I RECEIVED RECALL NOTICE FROM SUBARU (3/16/19) AND THE FIRST APPOINTMENT THEY COULD OFFER ME WAS JULY 7, 2019.  THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS NO WAY TO GET ME IN SOONER AS THEY WERE ALREADY PROCESSING "20 RECALL APPOINTMENTS A DAY."  UNTIL THEN I CANNOT USE THE PASSENGER SEAT WHICH IS NOT FEASIBLE GIVEN THAT I HAVE A DISABLED FATHER WHO IS NOT COMFORTABLE IN THE REAR SEATS.  A 4 MONTH WAIT TO REPAIR A LIFE THREATENING DEFECT THAT ESSENTIAL MAKES MY CAR UNFIT FOR ITS INTENDED USE SEEMS INCREDIBLY NEGLIGENT.
MY ORB WAS WORKING FULL TIME THAN JUST QUIT WITH WHEELS STRAIGHT, BUT WOULD WORK WITH QUARTER TURN AND NOW WON'T WORK AT ALL
OUR 2013 SUBARU OUTBACK WAS TWO YEARS OLD WHEN THE TILT STEERING FEATURE WOULD NOT STAY LOCKED INTO PLACE.  THE STEERING COLUMN FOR THE TILT STEERING WOULD NOT STAY LOCKED AND THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD DROP WHILE THE CAR WAS IN MOTION.  THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR WHERE WE WERE TOLD THAT INTERNAL LOCKING MECHANISM HAD BROKEN AND THE ENTIRE STEERING COLUMN NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  WHICH IT WAS REPLACED AND HAD HELD IN PLACE.  IN MARCH OF 2018 THE TILT STEERING WOULD ONCE AGAIN NOT STAY LOCKED INTO PLACE CAUSING THE STEERING WHEEL TO DROP WHILE IN MOTION.  IT WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE SAME DEALERSHIP, WHERE WE WERE TOLD THE SAME EXACT THING HAD HAPPENED AGAIN AND WOULD REQUIRE THE ENTIRE STEERING COLUMN TO BE REPLACED.    THE BIGGEST CONCERN HERE IS SAFETY.  THE STEERING COLUMN DROPPING WHILE THE CAR IS MOVING PUTS THE DRIVER AND ANYONE ELSE ON THE ROAD AT RISK.  WE WERE NEVER PROVIDED A PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THIS HAPPENED TO THE CAR NOT ONCE BUT TWICE.  THE EXPLANATION GIVEN FOR THE REOCCURRING PROBLEM WAS 'NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR FROM USING THE TILT FEATURE TOO MUCH.'  WE HAVE HAD OTHER SUBARU OUTBACKS WITH THE TILT STEERING FEATURE AND HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANY PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING WHEEL NOT LOCKING INTO PLACE.
TAKATA RECALL- WE HAD A CAR ACCIDENT 4-4-2016.  WE WERE TURNING INTO A PARKING LOT AND ANOTHER CAR DID NOT STOP AT THE STOP LIGHT AND HIT OUR CAR ON THE LEFT SIDE. POLICE WERE CALLED AND A REPORT WAS FILED.  OUR AIR BAGS DID NOT OPEN UP.
VIN: [XXX] YEAR: 2013 VEHICLE: OUTBACK MODEL: 2.5I PREMIUM  VEHICLE PURCHASE DATE 08/05/2013    AUGUST 2013 (LESS THAN 2500 MILES IN THE CAR) RETURNING FROM A TRIP PEMBROKE PINES, FL TO CLIFTON, NJ TO PEMBROKE PINES, FL. ON RETURNING TRIP SATURDAY, 11:00 AM OR SO. SOUTHBOUND ON I-95 BEFORE JACKSONVILLE, FL, OIL LIGHT TURN ON. SUBARU ROAD ASSISTANCE RECOMMENDED SUBARU OF JACKSONVILLE, FL. WENT THERE AND THEY POUR SOME OIL AND SAID EVERYTHING WAS FINE.  AUGUST 31ST, 2015, STARTED TO TRAVEL TO JACKSONVILLE, TALLAHASSEE AND GAINESVILLE, FL.  MORE THAN 3 SIMILAR INCIDENTS IN 2015.  JANUARY 2016 SITUATION INCREASES. BETWEEN DEC 2015 AND JAN 2016, CAR REPEATED THE LOW OIL LEVEL SITUATION 3 TIMES.  JAN 25, 2016, SUBARU OF JAX RAN A 1200 MILES OIL CONSUMPTION TEST. RESULT WAS NEGATIVE. MISSING OIL WAS BETWEEN SUBARU STANDARDS.  WEEKEND ON FRI, 04/08/2016 7:30 PM, DRIVING FROM JAX TO PEMBROKE PINES, FL, LOW OIL LEVEL LIGHT CAME BACK ON. TRIED TO RESET IT SEVERAL TIMES, TURNING THE CAR OFF AND ON. ONLY BY FORT LAUDERDALE LIGHT WENT OFF COMPLETELY.  OIL LEVEL CHECKED NEXT DAY 04/09/2016. OIL MISSING ON THE STICK. 2/3 OF QTR. OIL ADDED.  MON, 04/11/2016, VISITED SUBARU OF JAX AND REGISTER THE OCCURRENCE.  FRI, 05/06/ 2016, FROM JAX TO PEMBROKE PINES, FL AND BACK ON SUN, 05/08/2016. LOW OIL LEVEL LIGHT CAME ON SEVERAL TIMES. NEXT GAS STATION, PURCHASED MOST COMPATIBLE FULL SYNTHETIC QUARTER OIL AND POUR HALF OF THE BOTTLE. LIGHT WENT OFF FOR THE REST OF TRIP.  THU, 05/12/2016, WENT TO SUBARU OF JAX TO REPORT PROBLEM EXPERIENCED AND TO MAKE OIL CHANGE AT 49,702 MILES. AGREED WITH SERVICE MANAGER TO USE OIL WITH MORE VISCOSITY, 5W30 INSTEAD OF SUBARU RECOMMENDED 0W20. THEY CHECK OIL LEVEL AND DETERMINE THAT 3/4 OF A QUARTER OF OIL WAS MISSING. SO WE ARE TALKING OF QUARTER OR MORE OF TOTAL OIL MISSING BETWEEN OIL CHANGES. I DIDN'T LIKE THAT.    'INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6). *TR
THE ENGINE OIL LIGHT TURNED ON.  STOPPED TO CHECK OIL--WAS VERY LOW.  BOUGHT A QUART TO ADD TO THE CAR.  TOOK TO DEALERSHIP AND EXPLAINED WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  IT HAS OCCURRED TWO TIMES ALREADY--SAME ORDEAL WHERE I HAVE TO ADD OIL TO THE ENGINE.  WHEN WILL NHTSA START INVESTIGATING THIS?  I HAVE READ AND TALKED TO OTHER OUTBACK OWNERS WITH THE SAME ISSUE.    RIGHT NOW THE DEALERSHIP HAS PUT THE CAR ON A 1200 MILE INSPECTION TEST..... UPDATED 09/30/15*BF
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2013 SUBARU OUTBACK. WHILE ACCELERATING FROM A COMPLETE STOP, THE VEHICLE LUNGED FORWARD AND STALLED. THE DEALER WAS UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 2,500.
I HAVE HAD 2 INCIDENTS SINCE BUYING NEW OUTBACK IN APRIL 2013.    I WAS AT A COMPLETE STOP WHILE VEHICLE WAS IN DRIVE.  WHEN I LIFTED MY FOOT FROM BRAKE TO ACCELERATE, THE CAR REVVED UP AND LUNGED FORWARD ON ITS OWN.    BOTH TIMES I WAS ABLE TO SLAM ON THE BRAKE AND AVOID AN ACCIDENT.    NOW I FEEL THAT I CANNOT TRUST THE CAR WHENEVER I COME TO A STOP.    I AM WAITING TO HEAR FROM DEALER ABOUT THIS 2ND INCIDENT, SINCE AFTER 1ST TIME THEY TESTED AND SAID "CANNOT FIND A PROBLEM"......  HOWEVER, AFTER READING ANOTHER COMPLAINT IT COULD BE A MALFUNCTION BETWEEN ELECTRONIC ACCELERATOR PEDAL AND NEW CVT TRANSMISSION!!!  ALSO, SOMETIMES I FEEL THE CAR IS MAINTAINING A SPEED WITHOUT ANY ACCELERATION (LIKE ON CRUISE CONTROL).  *TR
VEHICLE WANDERS AT HIWAY SPEEDS REQUIRING CONSTANT CORRECTION. WILL NOT DRIVE A STRAIGHT PATH WITHOUT VEERING OFF. VERY UNSTABLE AND UNPREDICTABLE. DEALERSHIP CLAIMS VEHICLE IS WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS.

Water was coming out of my eyesight camera on the drivers side after a rain
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA WAS NOT DESIGNED OR MANUFACTURED PROPERLY AND IT ALLOWS MOISTURE TO GET INTO THE CAMERA ITSELF. AFTER A WHILE THE CAMERA WITH FUZZY PICTURE AND EVENTUALLY YOU CAN NOT VIEW THINGS PROPERLY OR SEE THEM AT ALL.  THERE ARE MANY OTHER COMPLAINTS BY OTHERS ON THE INTERNET.  THIS MAKES IT UNSAFE TO BACK THE CAR UP IF TRYING TO USE THE CAMERA TO ASSIST IN CLEARING THE PATH ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT.
WHILE DRIVING ON HIGHWAY WINDSHIELD CRACKED IN AN ARC PATTERN STARTING FROM THE DRIVERS SIDE TO PASSENGER SIDE RESULTING IN A PERFECT SYMMETRICAL PATTERN.  IT WAS AROUND 10 DEGREES OUTSIDE AND THE VEHICLES DEFROST AND HEAT WERE ON HIGH. NO OBJECT HIT WINDSHIELD BEFORE CRACK FORMED. VERY LOUD CRACKING NOISE AND SLOW FROM LEFT TO RIGHT FORMATION. I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THEM LOOK AT WHAT CAUSED CRACK AND THEY SAID "MUST HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A ROCK".  AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A CHIP IN WINDSHIELD, JUST THE CRACK. LATER IN THE YEAR I AGAIN WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE OF THE TECHNICAL BULLETIN ABOUT CRACKS HAPPENING IN THIS LOCATION ON THE WINDSHIELD AND WHILE USING DEFROSTER. THEIR RESPONSE WAS NOT OCCURRING WITH  2014 OUTBACKS.  IN JUNE I WENT TO LOU FUSZ DEALERSHIP TO DISCUSS THIS PROBLEM.  BY NOW MORE THAN 6 MONTHS SINCE OCCURRENCE, THERE ARE ROCK CHIPS IN WINDSHIELD THEREFORE THEY SAID CAUSED BY ROCK.  I FIRMLY BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED DUE TO THE DEFROST MECHANISM LOCATION AND THE INTEGRITY OF THE WINDSHIELD GLASS.
LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS KEEP BURNING OUT EVERY FEW MONTHS.
HOOD LATCH IS NOT HOLDING AT SPEEDS ABOVE 45 MPH EFFECTIVE 1/20/2019. OVER THE PAST WEEKS IT IS POPPING UP MORE FREQUENTLY. SO FAR SAFETY LATCH APPEARS TO BE HOLDING BUT DUE TO FREQUENT POP UPS, I HAVE SECURED MY HOOD WITH DUCT TAPE UNTIL I GET TO THE DEALER. IN CROSSING A BRIDGE ON 02/09/19 IN WINDY CONDITIONS, I BECAME VERY CONCERNED THAT THE LIFTING OF THE HOOD WOULD CAUSE A SAFETY ISSUE UNTIL I COULD SECURE IT. I HAVE AN APPT ON FRIDAY, 02/15,2019 BUT THEY INDICATE MY VIN IS NOT PART OF A SAFETY RECALL.
BACK UP CAMERA WENT OUT AT 60K MILES
THERE IS NO EMERGENCY BRAKE ON A 2014 OUTBACK,THE PARKING BRAKE DOES NOT WORK WHEN THE CAR IS MOVING.UNSAFE, IF ANYTHING HAPPENS WITH BRAKES THERE IS NOTHING TO STOP CAR FOR SAFETY THE HAND EMERGENCY BRAKE SHOULD BE IN THE CENTER CONSOLE, SO PASSENGER COULD ALSO PULL IT ON. .FRONT SPRINGS BOTTOM OUT FOR THE SLIGHTEST DIP IN THE ROAD.. I COMPLAINED  TO  SUBARU ABOUT THE BRAKE AND THEY TOLD ME BUY ANOTHER CAR
I HAD PUT THE PARKING BREAK ON IT GOT STUCK THE LIGHT FINALLY WENT OFF AND THE AT OIL TEMP LIGHT CAME ON I TOOK CAR TO DEALERSHIP THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE CAR HAD NO TRANSMISSION FLUID AND THEY BELIEVED THAT THE PLACE THAT CHANGED MY OIL HAD ACCIDENTALLY DRAINED TRANSMISSION FLUID THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE I NEVER HAD ANY ISSUES OR LIGHTS ON UNTIL THE NIGHT I PUT PARKING BREAK ON THE CAR ALREADY HAD A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM
VEHICLE HESITATES OCCASIONALLY ON ACCELERATION COMING OFF A STOP.
DRIVING AT APPROXIMATELY 20MPH, THE CAR SUDDENLY BEGINS TO SMELL OF GASOLINE. SOON THEREAFTER, ACCELERATION BECOMES HESITANT AND THE LOW-FUEL WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATES. THE VEHICLE QUICKLY BECAME INOPERABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUSY ROAD. THE VEHICLE IS A MODEL YEAR 2014 AND WAS PURCHASED BRAND NEW, LESS THAN SEVEN [7] MONTHS AGO (FROM THE DATE THIS COMPLAINT WAS POSTED). THE VEHICLE HAS ONLY APPROXIMATELY 9,000 MILES ON THE ODOMETER AND HAS NOT BEEN DRIVEN UNDER ANY ESPECIALLY SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS OR THROUGH TREACHEROUS TERRAIN.  *TR
Car unable to restart after sitting for several days. Battery and charging system test good after incident
See attached document for complaint
Oil consumption issues.  The oil is burning more then it should.  Oil light would come after 2 to 3 more after an oil change. The dealership has been notified and is working on ordering new parts for the engine. Replacing the small block of the engine.  Had less the 100k miles when this problem accured.  Electrical issues.  The battery is being drained after the car is turned off.  Car would not start in the morning and need to be jumped.  Additionally,  battery eventually dies and needs to be replaced. Dealership has been notified.
Inoperative horn. Traced to continuity failure in steering roll connector, part #83111AL13. No indication of fault and no other apparent continuity failure in adjoining wire paths.
The battery has gone completely dead 3 times over 6 years since I purchased this car new. The battery dies, like clockwork, every 2 years. I have purchased 2 new replacement batteries so far on 5/16/2017 (mileage 25,895) and 2/5/2019 (mileage 40,017). The third instance just occurred 1/5/2021 and I have not yet had a chance to take the car to a shop to determine whether the current jump-started battery will reliably hold a charge. Clearly, there is a problem in the Subaru electical system causing a constant drain on their batteries. A quick internet search uncovers that this has been a common occurrence among many Subaru owners over several model years.
Bought 2016 model December 29, 2015.  Battery consistently drains.  It has had at least 3 replacement batteries in 5 years.  Car has less than 46k miles on it.  Had to get jump started twice within a two week period, with a battery from February of 2020.    Battery issues 3/2018 26k miles 2/2020 37k miles 8/2021 45k miles 9/2021 45k miles
The contact owns a 2015 Subaru Outback. The contact stated that while attempting to start the vehicle, the vehicle failed to start. The contact attempted to jump start the battery with a battery charger however, the failure persisted. The contact stated that the battery would drain periodically. The contact stated that the battery had been replaced four times in a six-year period. The local dealer was made aware of the failure but informed the contact that the next available appointment was on the 29th of May. The contact replaced the battery himself. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was 47,784.
DRIVING DOWN STRAIGHT STRETCH OF FREEWAY ON THE INSIDE LANE AT 65-70MPH IN WET BUT SATISFACTORY CONDITION, MY VEHICLE SUDDENLY VEERED VIOLENTLY TO THE LEFT RESULTING IN COLLISION WITH CENTRAL ISLAND. NO PRIOR WARNING. VEHICLE IS VERY GOOD CONDITION AND MECHANICALLY SOUND. ALTHOUGH THE LEFT FRONT TIRE WAS DAMAGED AND DEFLATED, IT DIDN'T DISINTEGRATE AS I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED IF IT HAD BURST AT HIGH SPEED. I HAVE EXPERIENCED BLOWOUT TIRE PUNCTURES IN THE PAST AND IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THAT. THERE WAS A STEERING COLUMN RECALL FOR 2016/17 OUTBACKS WHICH MY VEHICLE WAS NOT A PART OF. COULD THIS BE AN UNDERLYING STEERING ISSUE?
THE REAR DOORS FOR OUR 2015 OUTBACK ARE STUCK IN THE CHILD SAFETY LOCK POSITION. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED. WE PAID OVER $300+ TO HAVE THE MECHANIC ACCIDENTALLY BREAK THE SWITCH AND THEN REPAIR IT. THE SWITCH ON THE OTHER DOOR IS ALSO STUCK WITH THE CHILD SAFETY LOCK ENGAGED.
I WAS PULLING INTO A PARKING SPACE AND AS I WAS GRADUALLY HITTING THE BRAKES, THE CAR STARTED TO ACCELERATE ON ITS OWN AT HIGH SPEED HITTING THE FENCE IN FRONT. I AM SURE THAT I DID NOT HAVE MY FOOT ON THE GAS. I HIT THE BRAKES AND IT WAS OF NO USE. AFTER HITTING THE FENCE THE CAR STOPPED AS I SHIFTED TO NEUTRAL. I AM SCARED TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 SUBARU OUTBACK. WHILE DRIVING 60 MPH, THE VEHICLE FAILED TO ACCELERATE, LOST POWER, AND THE CHECK AUTOMOTIVE TRANSMISSION AND CHECK ENGINE WARNING INDICATORS ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHO STATED THAT THE CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION FAILED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO SUBARU OF PUYALLUP (720 RIVER RD, PUYALLUP, WA 98371, (253) 286-5900) WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE INCORRECT TRANSMISSION FLUID WAS PLACED IN THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS CONTACTED AND PROVIDED CASE NUMBER: 150070620183. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 74,000.
I WAS ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY COMING TO STOP FOR A TRAFFIC LIGHT. ALL OF A SUDDEN THE CAR ACCELERATED.  I PRESSED HARDER ON THE BRAKE BUT IT WOULDN'T STOP. FINALLY I PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL AND TAPPED ON THE GAS PEDAL  AND THE ENGINE TUNED DOWN.  I PURCHASED THE CAR USED IN 2017 FROM HONDA NORTH.IN BUTLER PA. AFTER ABOUT 6 MONTHS THE INCIDENT HAPPENED.  THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE THEN AND HAS ONLY GOTTEN WORSE.  THIS PAST MONTH IT HAS BEEN HAPPENING AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK.  LRECENTLY  I ALMOST A SMALL CHILD AND HIS MOM PULLING OUT OF A PARKING SPOT.  I HAVE GRAND CHILDREN THAT I TAKE WITH ME DAILY AND I AM  SCARED WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THEY ARE IN THE CAR WITH ME WHEN THIS HAPPENS.    DOES SOMEONE HAVE TO DIE BEFORE YOU PAYS ATTENTION TO THIS ON GOING PROBLEM.    I EXPECT TO HEAR FROM SOMEONE SOON BEFORE THIS CAR ACCELERATES AND KILLS SOMEONE
REAR HATCH DOES NOT RELIABLY OPEN - CANNOT CLOSE AFTER MANUAL OVERRIDE.  VEHICLE HAS HAD ISSUE FOR OVER 15000 MILES AND 5 TIMES AT THE DEALER BUT HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED. REAR HATCH DOES NOT OPEN RELIABLY AND WHEN A MANUAL OVERRIDE IS NECESSARY TO REMOVE CARGO OR PETS, THE HATCH DOES NOT CLOSE EASILY AND DOOR LIGHT REMAINS ON EVEN WHILE DRIVING. THIS CAUSES AND OBVIOUS SAFETY ISSUE BOTH FOR CARGO ESCAPING THE VEHICLE AND ALSO FOR EXHAUST ENTERING THE VEHICLE.  THIS OCCURS WITH ALL DOORS UNLOCKED, VEHICLE IS STOPPED, KEY FOB IS ATTEMPTED AS WELL AS DOOR TRIGGER TO OPEN THE HATCH. NO MEMORY SET WHEN ATTEMPTING TO OPEN. NO USER ERROR.
THE SUNROOF ON THE VEHICLE EXPLODED RANDOMLY. CAUSING GLASS TO GO EVERYWHERE ALL OVER THE CAR WHILE ON THE FREEWAY.
VOICE ACTIVATED NAVIGATION SYSTEM.    THE VOICE ACTIVATED NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY UNRELIABLE.  THIS COULD LEAD TO AN ACCIDENT WHILE DRIVING.  I
AT TEMPERATURE 48 F, SAT IN STATIONARY CAR FOR 30 MIN WITH RADIO ON, LIGHTS ON. BATTERY RAN ALL THE WAY DOWN. HAD TO GET A JUMP. AT TEMPERATURE 36 F, SAT IN STATIONARY CAR 20 MIN. WITH RADIO OFF, LIGHTS OFF. BATTERY RAN ALL THE DAY DOWN. HAD TO GET A JUMP. SUBARU SAYS THAT BATTERY TESTS NORMAL ON GR-8 TEST AND THAT CURRENT DRAW IS NORMAL AT THIS TIME .010A-.027A. I'M CONCERNED THAT THE VEHICLE BATTERY IS NOT EQUIPPED TO SUPPORT ITS ELECTRICAL NEEDS. COULD KEY SYSTEM BE A FACTOR? SUBARU WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING BEYOND THE ABOVE TESTS. THERE ARE OTHER REPORTS LIKE THIS ON INTERNET SITES. MY CONFIDENCE IN THE VEHICLE IS ERODED.
WHEN I PULL THE EXPRESS WINDOW SWITCH TO LIFT MY DRIVER SIDE WINDOW, IT WILL GO ALL THE WAY UP AND THEN COME DOWN ABOUT HALFWAY. IT WILL NOT LET ME RAISE THE WINDOW UNLESS I MOVE THE SWITCH DOWN TO LOWER THE WINDOW. I THINK THE FIRST TIME IT DID IT WAS AROUND MAY, 2016. BY JULY, IT WAS DOING MORE AND MORE OFTEN, AND THE PASSENGER SIDE WAS ALSO DOING THE SAME THING. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER ON JULY 26 AND THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD TO REPROGRAM IT. THEY SAID IF IT DOES IT AGAIN, JUST HOLD THE SWITCH UP FOR 5 SECONDS AND THAT SHOULD REPROGRAM IT AGAIN. THAT DID NOT HELP. BOTH MY WINDOWS ARE DOING IT MORE OFTEN NOW. WHEN I GO BACK TO DEALER TO HAVE MY WINDSHIELD FIXED, I WILL LET THEM KNOW THAT MY POWER WINDOWS ARE STILL NOT WORKING PROPERLY. THIS PROBLEM OCCURS WHILE I AM DRIVING OR STATIONARY. IT DOES NOT DO IT ALL THE TIME, BUT IT DOES IT ENOUGH TIMES THAT IT IS PROBLEMATIC.
WE TEST DRIVE A 2015 OUTBACK SUBARU AT THE DEALERSHIP. IT HAD A CRACK IN IT AND DIDN'T THINK TO MUCH OF IT 20K MILES. WE ENDED UP PURCHASING THIS ONE PRIVATELY AND IT HAS A CRACKED WINDSHIELD AS WELL. IT ONLY HAS 11K MILES. THE CRACK ON THE OUTBACK THAT WE PURCHASED STARTS AT THE TOP MIDDLE OF THE WINDSHIELD BEHIND THE REARVIEW MIRROW AND CUTS DOWN AND TO THE RIGHT ABOUT 8 INCHES. AFTER READING THE COMPLAINTS ON THIS SITE, IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S A HUGE DEFECT WITH THE WINDSHIELD AND DEFROSTER THAT NEEDS TO BE RECALLED. THIS IS A MASSIVE SAFETY ISSUE!
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 SUBARU OUTBACK. WHILE DRIVING 75 MPH, A PEBBLE STRUCK THE CONTACT'S WINDSHIELD AND CREATED A TWELVE INCH CRACK. UPON ARRIVING HOME, THE CRACK EXPANDED TO APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN INCHES IN THE SHAPE OF THE LETTER "U". THE VEHICLE WAS NOT TAKEN TO A DEALER OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 12,000.
HAD A SMALL STONE HIT THE WINDSHIELD AND SAW NOTHING AT THE TIME.  ABOUT HALF HOUR LATER, WE SAW A CRACK IN THE LOWER PART OF THE WINDSHIELD, WHICH SPREAD QUICKLY ACROSS THE DRIVER'S SIDE.  WAS TOLD BY THE GLASS REPLACEMENT COMPANY THAT THESE WINDSHIELDS WERE ON BACK ORDER AND HAD TO WAIT WEEKS FOR REPAIR.  THEN ON AUGUST 22, 2015 WE HAD ANOTHER SMALL STONE HIT THE WINDSHIELD ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE.  IT WAS SMALL AND NORMALLY WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THIS FIXED.  BUT WE SAW IT START TO SPREAD AND THEN HEARD A LOUD POP AND SAW THE THING STAR OUT INTO SIX DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS QUICKLY.  THESE STONES WERE NOT VERY LARGE AND I'VE NEVER HAD A WINDSHIELD REACT LIKE THE SUBARU.  I'VE HAD LARGER STONES HIT OUR TOYOTA AND WAS ABLE TO GET A REPAIR PRIOR TO A WINDSHIELD BEING REPLACED.  I BELIEVE THERE IS AN ISSUE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF THESE WINDSHIELDS.  THESE ARE EXPENSIVE TO KEEP REPLACING AND I AM CONCERNED WITH SAFETY OF THESE WINDSHIELDS.
WINDSHIELD CRACKED APPROXIMATELY 8". CRACK IS INSIDE GLASS (GLASS IS SMOOTH ON EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR OF CAR). NO TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATIONS AND NO IMPACTS TO VEHICLE. VEHICLE PARKED IN GARAGE WHEN CRACK OCCURRED - GLASS WAS NOT CRACKED WHEN PARKED IN SECURE GARAGE FRIDAY EVENING. WAS CRACKED WHEN I WENT TO THE CAR ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON.
CAR WAS PARKED IN A PARKING LOT AWAY FROM TREES OR ANY OTHER VEGETATION.  WAS GONE FROM CAR FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES.  UPON RETURN, THERE WAS A 12 INCH CRACK DESCENDING FROM UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER OF WINDSHIELD.  BY MORNING, AFTER HAVING BEEN PARKED INSIDE A LOCKED GARAGE, AND WITH LESS THAN 2 MORE MILES DRIVEN, CRACK HAD GROWN ANOTHER 12 INCHES (APPROXIMATELY.)
ON 4/19/2015 WAS DRIVING AT 40 MILES PER HOUR IN A HEAVY RAIN STORM (I-75) IN GEORGIA A CRACK DEVELOPED IN THE WINDSHIELD. WE COULD NOT IDENTIFY A SOURCE OF IMPACT TO THE WINDSHIELD. THE CRACK STARTED AT THE VERY BOTTOM CENTER OF THE WINDSHIELD. THE CRACK THEN SPLIT INTO A "Y" SHAPE AND CONTINUED OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. WE TRIED TO GET A NEW WINDSHIELD IN SARASOTA, FL OUR FIRST DESTINATION. LOCAL AUTO GLASS COMPANY RECOMMENDED BY SARASOTA SUBARU DEALER ATTEMPTED TO ORDER ONE TO REPLACE DURING OUR WEEK IN TOWN. THEN CALLED TO ADVISE US IT WOULD BE AT LEAST ANOTHER WEEK.  WE WERE INFORMED THERE WAS A NATIONWIDE BACK LOG OF OVER 600 WINDSHIELDS FOR THE 2015 SUBARU OUTBACK. ON 4/27/2015 CONTACTED THE SUBARU DEALER IN SILVER SPRING, MD. FOR POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT DURING OUR SECOND STOP OF TRIP. WE WERE AGAIN ADVISED OF  A BACK LOG ON THAT WINDSHIELD. THEY SUGGESTED  TO CONTACT THE DEALER NEAR MY HOME. ON 4/27/15 CONTACTED INTERNATIONAL SUBARU OF TINLEY PARK, IL AND ALL STAR GLASS AS  RECOMMENDED BY DEALER. WINDSHIELD ORDERED 4/27/2015 AND WAS ADVISED AGAIN OF A NATIONWIDE BACK ORDER OF 2015 SUBARU OUTBACK WINDSHIELDS BY GLASS COMPANY AND MY DEALER. AS OF 5/14/15, NO WINDSHIELD AVAILABLE, CHECK BACK IN ANOTHER WEEK. SUBARU DEALER AT HOME THINKS IT WAS CAUSED BY A SMALL STONE. INDEPENDENT MECHANICS THINK THERE IS A PRESSURE POINT ON THE VEHICLE THAT AFFECTED THE WINDSHIELD. IF THERE IS NOT A CONTRIBUTING VEHICLE PROBLEM WITH THE WINDSHIELD THEN WHY THE VERY LONG BACK LOG FOR A NEW VEHICLE WINDSHIELD?  REALLY THAT MANY 2015 SUBARU OUTBACKS WITH WINDSHIELD PROBLEMS?  AND, 3 DIFFERENT DEALERS IN 3 DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY GETTING THE PART.  WHEN THE WINDSHIELD IS FINALLY REPLACED, WILL HAVE THAT AREA CAREFULLY INSPECTED FOR POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS.
AFTER JUST PICKING UP MY NEW 2015 SUBARU OUTBACK AND DRIVING IN BRIGHT SUNLIGHT, I REALIZED THERE IS A HAZARDOUS CONDITION RELATED TO THE CAR'S INFOTAINMENT CENTER. THE AREA SURROUNDING THE DISPLAY SCREEN IS AN EXTREMELY GLOSSY BLACK MIRROR-LIKE REFLECTIVE SURFACE. WHILE DRIVING, THE SUN REFLECTS OFF OF THIS SURFACE INTO THE EYES OF THE DRIVER. THIS INTENSITY IS ENOUGH TO CAUSE EYE PAIN, AS WELL AS DISTRACT THE DRIVER. NOW WHEN DRIVING ON A SUNNY DAY, RATHER THAN KEEPING BOTH HANDS ON THE WHEEL, I NEED TO USE MY RIGHT HAND TO SHIELD MY EYES FROM THIS DISTRACTING REFLECTED GLARE. I ATTEMPTED TO PURCHASE AN ANTI-GLARE SHIELD, BUT THEY ONLY COVER THE DISPLAY AREA (WHICH ACTUALLY IS NOT REFLECTIVE). I NEED TO COVER THE REFLECTIVE PERIMETER TRIM AREA. SUBARU NEEDS TO PROVIDE AN ANTI-GLARE SHIELD THAT COVERS THE ENTIRE INFOTAINMENT CENTER.  *TR
IN NOVEMBER 2014, I TOOK DELIVERY OF A NEW 2015 SUBARU OUTBACK, 3.6 LIMITED.  THE VEHICLE WAS EQUIPPED WITH THE OPTIONAL PREMIUM ELECTRONICS PACKAGE, AND THE EYESIGHT COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM.       AFTER ABOUT THREE WEEKS OF OWNERSHIP, I STARTED TO EXPERIENCE RANDOM MALFUNCTIONS WITH THE KEY-LESS IGNITION, AND THE KEY-LESS ENTRY SYSTEMS.  THE IGNITION PROBLEMS ALL INVOLVED ENGINE START, AND OCCURRED IN SCENARIOS WHERE THE KEY-FOB WASN'T RECOGNIZED.      ABOUT THE SAME TIME, THE GPS NAVIGATION SYSTEM STARTED TO DISPLAY ERRONEOUS LOCATIONAL DATA, AND THE ASSOCIATED 'STARLINK' TOUCH SCREEN SYSTEM WOULD FREEZE-UP (BECOME INOPERABLE).  AS OF TODAY, I HAVE POSTED SIX DIFFERENT VIDEOS TO YOUTUBE TO DRAMATICALLY ILLUSTRATE THE PROBLEM.  HTTPS://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=9MF_RUMICQM .        I HAVE HAD THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER FIVE TIMES FOR THIS PROBLEM, AND IT CAN'T BE FIXED.  I HAVE ALSO MET WITH SUBARUS, SEATTLE ZONE SERVICE MANAGER.  IN EMAILS FROM SUBARU'S CORPORATE SERVICE OFFICIALS, THEY REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM EXISTS, DESPITE THE VIDEOS.  UNOFFICIALLY, THE ZONE SERVICE MANAGER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SOME OTHER OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUE, WHICH HE BELIEVES IS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM IN VEHICLES WITH THIS OPTION COMBINATION.  HE DOES NOT KNOW OF ANY SOLUTION.      MY CONCERN IS THAT THE EYESIGHT SYSTEM CAN OVERRIDE DRIVER COMMANDS INVOLVING BRAKING, AND ENGINE THROTTLE.  WILL THE PROBLEMS WITH THE GPS AND STARLINK TOUCH-SCREENS POTENTIALLY CREATE A DANGEROUS MALFUNCTION OF THE EYESIGHT SYSTEM THAT CREATES AN ACCIDENT RATHER THAN MITIGATING IT?  *TR
The steering warning light came on and my steering wheel stiffened. Luckily I was able to make it home, but when I went back to crank it. The light was still on and it would only move forward of backwards; because I wasn't able at all to turn the steering wheel.
Car exhaust inside the vehicle when driving at low speeds, idling, or parked into the cab of the vehicle. Only way to stop the exhaust fumes is to use the recirculate interior air.  Rear hatch hydraulics are failing, hatch will not open completely and partially shuts when opened. When driving very loud squeaking from vehicle.
While driving on the highway at about 60mph my 2016 Outback suddenly accelerated much faster.  The only way to avoid collision with another car or cars or end up in a ditch was to drive around them.  The brake did not work!  After a minute or more(?) I eventually was able to stop using the brake.
Summary of Electrical system issues: 1.pertaining to battery draining and 2. eyesight randomly goes out and other dash board lights flash and later goes away. As well as, 3. Windows that can not completely close at times. Details:  I purchased 2016 Subaru outback -  4 cylinder in 2019 with 64,000 miles. By 2020, the car experienced random dashboard lights indicator flashing that would resolve itself (*the flashing light) in a few days. One issue was the eye sight would randomly inactivate while driving and resolve after turning off car for a half day or a day. However it happens often.  Dealer Car repair shop said it could not duplicate. Besides the dash board lights issues; the passenger front window and moonroof would not go up to completely close at random times. Rendering the windows useless to use. These issues continued on and off from purchase thru to-date. The biggest issue came in 2021 & 2022, when the battery would drain. A jump of the battery seem to resolve the problem. Auto store would jump battery and show CCA and CA and Alternator output proficient for the battery.  On random times the battery would have the same draining issue.  I am not convinced it is a battery issue for these incidents. I believe it is related to an electrical issue for all of these issues.  Risk: The components installed and advertised by the Subaru brand influenced me to purchase the vehicle over other vehicles because of its safety records and longevity of the vehicle.  This is clearly a false and fraudulent marketing. The Subaru has failed to provide my confidence as a consumer of its safety record.  I am extremely uncomfortable driving the vehicle more than 30 miles locally because of fear it will breakdown or I will be stranded.  Even locally, I have had to purchase a AAA membership at an extra expense to ensure some means of assistance. Recently, within 2 days I have had ti use my membership for a drained battery. I am now seeing many Subaru owners make similar complaints.
This incident occurred on Friday July 29, 2022 @ 5pm. I was pulling into a parking space while  my foot was on the brake I proceeded to put the car in park when the car suddenly lunged forward into the concrete patio of the Market/Store. I was in disbelief at what just happened.  I would happily make my car available for inspection. I want to find out what is wrong with the car. I believe this could happen again and I am fearful for my life and the lives of others.  I was so lucky that the table and chairs were roped off that evening for some reason. People could have been sitting or walking there at the time of this incident.   This incident has not been reproduced or confirmed by the dealer or independent service center.  I brought the car to the Subaru dealer for them to do a diagnostic test and any other things needed to give me some answers & repairs.  I was told no issues were found. They also told me they would like to have my car for a week so they could drive it & do more test. I asked for a loaner and they said they could not do that. I can’t afford to rent a car for a week. And I feel they will come back to me with the same answer of not being able to find an issue.   I have had this car for almost 3 years and I park by putting my foot on the brake and then shift into park. There was a malfunction! What it was I don’t know. But I do know something went very wrong with the vehicle.  There was never any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to this failure.
Car will repeatedly will not start.   This has happened many times.  New battery and with in weeks would not start again.    Had battery checked and alternator both work fine. This is a safety issue if you need your vehicle for and emergency and it will not start.
The contact owns a 2016 Subaru Outback. The contact stated while approaching the vehicle in the morning, she noticed a L-shaped crack in the windshield which originated on the passenger’s side of the windshield. The contact took the vehicle to the dealer and was informed that an issue with the windshield wiper had caused the fracture. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 46,000.
For months, there have been incidents of battery drain where the vehicle is unable to be started without a jump charge.  I have replaced the battery several times; electrical testing by the dealership does not diagnose any problem.
We purchased this vehicle as a private sale in Nov 2018. In May 2020, the battery failed and was replaced, thinking it had reached end of life.. One month later, in June 2020, this new battery was dead, and was replaced under warranty under the premise that it was a bad battery. In addition, at the time of this 2nd battery replacement, the vehicle was inspected by our dealership to assess why the battery died, and though no direct cause was found, the battery cables were replaced. This July 11th, 2021, the battery was dead once again, and replaced under warranty, again thinking it was a defective battery. Yesterday, July 25th, two weeks after this 3rd new battery replacement, the battery was dead again. No user error was ever noted (no internal light left on, vehicle had been driven regularly every day of the week, etc.). Upon research online, there appears to be a class action lawsuit against Subaru regarding electrical problems that rapidly drain batteries in several Subaru models 2016-2020, which includes our 2016 Outback. We can never know when our battery could fail, and clearly cannot trust this vehicle to start on any given day, which is a serious safety concern. We have been unsuccessful in our attempts to communicate with Subaru customer support. Please investigate this complaint as appropriate. Thank you.
Battery has died several times over the past few months. The last time (7/3/21) within 48 hours of being fully charged. Subaru replaced the battery several months ago, so it’s a fresh battery. They did not mention the electrical system problems they know about and have known about since 2017.
FREQUENT BATTERY REPLACEMENT IN 2016 SUBARU OUTBACK PURCHASED 9/29/2016. DEALER REPLACED THE BATTERY UNDER WARRANTY ON 12/11/2017, DEALER REPLACED AGAIN ON 3/22/2019 WITH SUBARU BATTERIES BOTH TIMES. I REPLACED IT AGAIN ON 1/01/2021 WITH A WALMART BATTERY. MADE THIS COMPLAINT ON 5/15/2021. 3 BATTERIES IN 4 YEARS AND 8 MONTHS SEEMS TO INDICATE AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM
BATTERY WILL NOT KEEP CHARGE WHILE PARKED.  FULLY DEPLETES WITHOUT WARNING.  WILL NOT START.  WILL NOT UNLOCK WITH FOB.  DEALER REPLACED BATTERY, BUT PROBLEM CAME BACK SEVERAL MONTHS LATER.  MULTIPLE CHARGINGS WERE TEMPORARY ONLY
KEY WILL NOT COME OUT OF IGNITION CYLINDER INTERMITTENTLY. THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE FOR SUBARU UNDER THEIR OWN TSB 16-112-18R.
BATTERY DIES FREQUENTLY WITHOUT OBVIOUS CAUSE, EVEN AFTER REPLACING BATTERY SOONER THAN EXPECTED.  IT HAPPENS AFTER DRIVING FOR 30 MINUTES, TURNING IT OFF FOR A SHORT PERIOD LIKE 15-20 MINUTES, THEN TRYING TO RESTART, AS WELL AS AFTER SITTING FOR 8-10 HOURS.
WHEN I TRIED TO START MY CAR THE BATTERY WAS DEAD.  THIS HAPPENED TWICE LAST YEAR AND I THEN REPLACED THE BATTERY.  THIS NEW BATTERY IS ONLY 4 MONTHS OLD AND YESTERDAY IT WAS DEAD AGAIN.  EACH TIME A FEW DAYS HAD PASSED SINCE THE CAR HAD LAST BEEN DRIVEN.  IT SEEMS THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE CAR THAT IS DRAINING THE BATTERY.  IN ADDITION, POSSIBLY RELATED TO THE DEAD BATTERY THERE WERE A COUPLE OF TIMES WHEN WE FOUND THE BACK HATCH WIDE OPEN.  THE BATTERY WAS NOT DEAD AFTER THIS HAPPENED.
I REPLACED THE INITIAL BATTERY ON 10/22/2018 WITH A BATTERY RECOMMENDED FOR THIS VEHICLE.  4/17/20 I REPLACED THE BATTERY AGAIN. ON NOVEMBER 15, 2020 THE CAR BATTERY WAS COMPLETELY DRAINED.  I PURCHASED A POWER PACK TO KEEP IN THE CAR FOR EMERGENCIES.  ON DECEMBER 2, 2020 THE CAR BATTERY WAS COMPLETED DRAINED AGAIN. LUCKILY, I WAS STATIONARY WHEN THESE INCIDENTS HAPPENED.  AFTER THESE TWO INCIDENTS, I AM TAKING IT TO THE DEALERSHIP TOMORROW.  I TRAVEL FOR WORK TO SOME REMOTE PLACES AND AM NO LONGER CONFIDENT IN THIS CAR'S PERFORMANCE.
WHEN THE CAR IS STARTED UP ON A COLD MORNING IT IDLES TOO FAST AND LURCHES DANGEROUSLY WHEN PUT INTO DRIVE.  I HAVE TO HOLD THE CAR BACK WITH FIRM BRAKING.  I HAVE HAD NUMEROUS CLOSE CALLS OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS THAT I HAVE OWNED THE CAR.  THE CAR IS A 2016 OUTBACK 3.6 R WITH A 6 CYLINDER ENGINE.
MY 2016 SUBARU OUTBACK ALL OF SUDDEN HAD WARNING LIGHTS SUCH AS: BRAKE, ABS, AND STABILITY TRACTION CONTROL POPPED UP ON THE DASHBOARD WHEN THE CAR WAS IN PARK ANS WHEN I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND WILL NOT GO AWAY.  IT HAS MADE MY STEERING WHEEL REALLY HARD TO TURN.
AFTER APPROX. TWO WEEKS OF INACTIVITY, BATTERY WAS COMPLETELY DEAD. REQUIRED A JUMP START. TOOK TO AUTO SHOP; BATTERY AND ALTERNATOR BOTH TESTED AS "GOOD". CAR STARTED NORMALLY DURING DAILY USE FOR SEVERAL DAYS. THEN, AFTER 7 DAYS OF INACTIVITY, BATTERY WAS COMPLETELY DEAD AGAIN. CAR STORED ON STREET PARKING. WEATHER TYPICAL FOR SPRING MONTHS IN WASHINGTON STATE (I.E. INTERMITTENT RAIN; TEMPS OF 40-60 DEGREES). ONLINE SEARCH REVEALS SEVERAL SITES WHERE NUMEROUS CUSTOMERS REPORT EXPERIENCING THE SAME FAULTY ELECTRICAL ISSUES. EXAMPLE: HTTPS://WWW.CARGURUS.COM/CARS/DISCUSSION-T58701_DS833514 OR HTTPS://WWW.TORQUENEWS.COM/1084/SUBARU-HIT-NEW-LAWSUIT-OVER-OUTBACK-WAGON-DEAD-BATTERY-ISSUE.  *TR
MY VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION ON A HIGHWAY WHEN A PEBBLE STRUCK THE WINDSHIELD AND A CHIP WAS FORMED ON 8/26/2016.  THIS CHIP WAS IMMEDIATELY REPAIRED. THIS WAS ONLY MONTHS FROM PURCHASING A BRAND NEW 2016 SUBARU OUTBACK; FACTORY TO DEALER.   THEN, WHILE PARKED, IT WAS NOTED THAT THE CHIP FORMED A SPREADING CRACK ON 11/13/2017. AT THIS POINT, THE WINDSHIELD WAS REPLACED WITH NEW, ORIGINAL SUBARU GLASS.  *TR
WHEN PUTTING AUTO INTO PARK, KEY WILL NOT TURN FAR ENOUGH TO ALLOW KEY TO COME OUT. HAVE TO RESTART CAR , SHIFT INTO OTHER GEARS AND RETURN TO PARK UNTIL THE KEY WILL COME OUT. I HAVE ANOTHER EXACT YEAR AND MODEL VEHICLE WHICH HAD THE SAME ISSUE AND IT WAS REPAIRED ABOUT 1 1/2 YEARS AGO. VEHICLE STATIONARY.
DRIVING AT AROUND 40 MILES PER HOUR AND SUDDENLY LOST CONTROL OF THE STEERING WHEEL. THE STEERING WHEEL BECAME VERY LOOSE AND UNRESPONSIVE. IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS. TOOK TO DEALERSHIP RIGHT AWAY AND THEY COULDN'T FIGURE OUT ANYTHING.
I HAVING PROBLEM GETTING MY KEY OUT OF THE IGNITION FROM MY SUBURU  OUTBACK 2016, ALMOST EVERYTIME I STOPPED AN ENGINE THIS PROBLEM OCCUR.
THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION DOES NOT ENGAGE OFTEN CAUSING A JERKING MOTION OF THE CAR WHICH IS UNDIAGNOSED FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS. SUBARU EXTENDED THE TRANSMISSION WARRANTY FOR ONE YEAR.  I WANT IT FIXED. MY WIFE AND I HAVE COMPLAINED SINCE THE CAR WAS NEW (2016 MODEL)
I HAD EXPERIENCED A SHUDDER, POP, REVVING RPMS OF THE VEHICLES BEFORE A SUDDEN POWER LOSS AT HIGHWAY SPEED (65MPH).  I WAS UNABLE TO ACCELERATE AND HAD LIMITED STEERING TO GET OFF THE HIGHWAY SAFELY.  THE VEHICLE HAD STALLED BY THE TIME I WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  I WAS THEN UNABLE TO RESTART THE VEHICLE AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS. A TOWING SERVICE WAS CALLED TO BRING IT TO A LOCAL DEALERSHIP.  WITHIN AN HOUR TIME PERIOD THE VEHICLE RAPIDLY LOST ELECTRICAL POWER AND HAZARD LIGHTS WERE NO LONGER FUNCTIONAL.  THIS UNFORTUNATELY WAS LATE AT NIGHTTIME, MAKING THE VISIBILITY OF THE VEHICLE VERY MINIMAL.  THE VEHICLE WAS EVALUATED AT A LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND REPORTED THAT THERE WAS A SOFTWARE PROBLEM WITH THE CHARGING SYSTEMS OF THE CAR.  THE SYSTEM WAS UPDATED, BUT THE DEALERSHIP COULD NOT PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION FOR THE REVVING ENGINE, SHUDDERING, POWER LOSS AND STALLING THAT OCCURRED PRIOR TO THE INABILITY TO RESTART THE VEHICLE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.
BATTERY DIES IF CAR IS NOT DRIVEN WEEKLY.  STEERING COLUMN REPLACED TWICE AND STEERING RACK ONCE.
INTERMITTENTLY ALL THE LIGHTS IN THE DASH WILL GO OUT FOR APPROXIMATELY TWO SECONDS, THEN COME BACK ON. DURING THIS PERIOD OF TIME, I HAVE NOTHING ON THE DASH, NO SPEEDOMETER, TURN SIGNALS, EYESIGHT, RADIO, ETC. TO ME THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD. IT HAPPENS, SO FAST THAT I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO SEE IF MY HEADLIGHTS OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE ARE FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY OR NOT, SO THAT I AM BEING SEEN BY OTHER MOTORISTS.  IT HAS HAPPENED ON TWO OCCASIONS WHEN I HIT A POTHOLE. MY DEALERSHIP HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO RE-CREATE THIS PROBLEM. I FEEL IT IS A SHORT IN THE DASH. IT IS ALWAYS WHEN I AM DRIVING, BUT IT NEVER LASTS MORE THAN 2-3 SECONDS AND THE DEALER TELLS ME TO "BRING IT IN WHILE IT'S HAPPENING". THIS HAPPENS EVERY FEW WEEKS AND HAS HAPPENED SINCE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.
WINDSHIELD CRACK APPEARED SUDDENLY ORIGINATING NEAR THE HEATING ELEMENT AT THE BOTTOM .DO NOT SEE ANY VISIBLE ROCK HIT MARKS .  DEALERSHIP DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE ANY MANUFACTURING DEFECTS  AND I HAVE TO GET IT REPAIRED USING MY INSURANCE .
A FEW TIMES WHILE SLOWING DOWN OR PUTTING ON THE BRAKES I FOUND MY FOOT WAS ALSO ON THE GAS PEDAL. I FIND THAT THE GAS PEDAL AND BRAKE PEDAL ARE VERY CLOSE AND AT THE SAME HEIGHT. THE LAST TIME AT THE DEALER I ASKED TO CHECK OUT THE BRAKE PEDAL AND WAS TOLD EVERY THING WAS IN ORDER.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2016 SUBARU OUTBACK. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE WINDSHIELD PREMATURELY FAILED AND CRACKED WITHOUT IMPACT. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE AND HAD A DEALER SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT TO INVESTIGATE HOW THE WINDSHIELD GLASS PREMATURELY CRACKED. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 1,600.
DRIVING IN THE CENTER OF MY LANE ON A WET HIGHWAY. CRUISE CONTROL ON AT 65 MPH. LANE SWAY ON. THE CAR ACTED AS IF THE LANE SWAY ACTIVATED AND GAVE A STRONG STEERING WHEEL BUMP LIKE IT DOES IF YOU ARE CLOSE TO THE SIDE ROAD STRIPE. I WAS DEAD CENTER IN MY LANE, AND THERE WAS NO REASON FOR IT TO BUMP THE STEERING. IT DID THIS TO ME THREE TIMES WITHIN A TEN MILE DRIVE. AFTER THE THIRD TIME I TURNED THE LANE SWAY OFF AND WAS SOON DRIVING IN TOWN AND IT DID NOT DO IT AGAIN. MY WIFE SAYS SOMETIMES WHILE COMING TO A STOP AT A LIGHT, THE CAR WILL PULL VERY HARD AND ABRUPTLY TO THE LEFT. THE CAR HAS 3400 MILES ON IT, SO THERE SHOULD BE NOTHING WRONG WITH BRAKE PADS OR ROTORS.
On 08/17/17 I purchased a new Outback off a Subaru dealers' lot.  The fall of 2023 I noticed rust starting on the column portion of the driver's side door.  It is on the CAR INTERIOR, ABOVE THE WINDOW. This is a highly unusual area for rust to start.  Typically rust starts on the bottom of a car, not 2/3 of the way up from the bottom.  I was told by the dealership that it was not covered under warranty, and I was on my own.  On 10/22/24 I went to an autobody shop to have the rust repaired.  I was told that based off of the bubbling that was occurring on the rust, the rust is not surface rust but occurring on the interior of the door.  He said that this was a flaw in production as this should not be occurring.  This is evident by the fact that there is no rust on any of the other doors or anywhere else on the car.    I called the Subaru dealership and had them look at it.  They did not have an autobody shop but the appointment clerk submitted a request for a review to Subaru of Americ.  The outcome of the review was a rejection due to being beyond the warranty of the car.  This was a production error.  I drove out of the lot with a defective door.  This resulted in the door being completely rusted on the interior as is evident by the rust through on the INTERIOR of the door.  Also, the rust is now presenting itself on the bottom seam.    To have this patched is a waste of money as the whole door interior is rusted.  I am concerned about the integrity of the door.  If I was T-boned or in a roll-over accident, would this door provide the safety I am expecting from a fairly new car?  I believe it will crumble in a pile of rust.  Subaru is aware of this issue as there are a couple of forums about this reoccurring problem.  I hope enough people file a complaint so some action can be taken to keep us safe.  I am now forced to pay out $3,368.53 in order to replace the door so I and my passengers have the safest auto construction this car should offer.  Car is available.
Throttle fails to respond for a brief but serious amount of time.  When pulling into traffic, instead of accelerating the engine remains at an idle and the car moves forward slowly.  I push on the throttle trying to make it go.  Then it takes hold and the car leaps forward. Safety:  Normal power is delayed as the car moves into traffic.  Oncoming traffic must slow to prevent an accident. The dealer where I purchased the car, Santa Monica, CA, tried to find error codes.  Also removed the throttle valve to check that it wasn't somehow stuck.  They drove the car briefly.  They say they've done all they can.   No warning lamps, messages, codes stored in the computer. Note that the throttle pedal signals the computer to work the engine throttle valve (so I'm told).  Problem occurs about once a month.  First time was when I took posession at the dealer's.  I  requested to recind my purchase but, because I didn't by the cancellation option ($250), they refused.
failure of battery within 24 months of last replacement, average battery life for this car is 24 months.  Dealer claims that there is no maintenance bulletin related to premature battery failure.  have found the following Subaru mc-10117535-9999 service bulletin but have no history of dealer utilizing this to resolve problem.    Cannot leave car unattended for more than 3 days without having to jump start car in order to use.
My airbag indicator light on the passenger side comes on.  Then it goes off. Then it comes on again sometime and goes off. It has been off a while. But to me this indicates a system issue with the passenger airbag.
Hello, I am making a complaint about my 2017 Subaru Outback's windshield.  I am frustrated that my windshield has cracked for the second time in just over 2 years.  In early October 2020, I purchased the vehicle as a used car. Three weeks later a small rock hit the windshield on the driver's side and a small chip became a large crack that spread across my vision over 1 ft long. I brought it to the Subaru dealership I purchased the vehicle from to have it replaced, which cost over $500.00 for parts and labor which included recalibration of the eyesight technology installed with the vehicle.  I recently (January 2023) replaced my windshield wipers and as I was doing so the passenger side wiper arm slipped from my hand and struck the windshield and immediately formed a 5 inch crack. The wiper arm was about 3 to 4 inches away from the windshield when this happened.  I cannot believe this happened at all. In both cases the cracks traveled well over a foot across the windshield within 2 days.  My vehicle is equipped with  eyesight technology and I have come to understand that the windshields on these vehicles are made thinner than usual to accommodate it. I believe this is a defect in their windshield manufacturing and/or design. I find it unacceptable the windshield is that fragile. Subaru vehicles are touted as very dependable, rugged and capable of off road use. My confidence in this notion is low and everytime something strikes the windshield I pray it doesn't crack. I will be spending over $1000.00 for new windshields in the 2 plus years I've owned this vehicle.
I was driving my 2017 Subaru Outback on a trip from New York to Florida.  On I-95 in heavy traffic I hit a bump in the road, and at that instant, nearly every warning light on my dash came on, including EyeSight, lane departure, and emergency braking.  My adaptive cruise immediately disengaged causing the vehicle to suddenly slow (this incident was at highway speed).  The "brake" light was also illuminated. Not knowing what happened, I pulled over on the side of the highway and found that the wire to the electric parking brake on the passenger side had disconnected from the brake module.  I tried to plug it back in, but it would not stay.  I secured the cable with a hair tie and continued on the trip.  Approximately 500 miles later, I hit another bump or pothole, and the same thing happened. I checked under the car again, and discovered that the driver side had failed in the same manner.  I secured the cable with another hair tie and was able to complete my trip.  When I returned home, I discovered that this is a known issue and there is a Subaru TSB published, 06-63-18R.  There is no warranty on this issue, and I was charged nearly $750 to fix a KNOWN PROBLEM caused by a plastic retainer.  In my opinion, this issue should be treated as a safety defect and subject to a recall to replace with the newer part.  Having all of your vehicle assists suddenly fail at highway speed in heavy traffic is a disconcerting and dangerous event.
The battery keeps draining. This is our second battery replacement. Had to jump start the car few times.
Battery has paracitic draw caused by ECU problem.  Battery dies if not driven every day.
The contact owns a 2017 Subaru Outback. The contact stated that while attempting to start the vehicle, the vehicle failed to start. The vehicle was jump started. The contact had the battery replaced; however, the failure persisted. The vehicle was taken to the dealer to be diagnosed; however, the mechanic found not fault with the vehicle. The manufacturer was not contacted. The failure mileage was 40,000.
We have had to replace the battery on our Outback 4 times in 5 years. We have been told that we have so many Bells & Whistles on the Outback that frequently having to replace the battery is a common occurring problem..... The battery just dies with warning. I have been told by the Service Department that they have checked the system and that there is NOTHING wrong with the car. My daughter saw the recalls and problem list online and this is why I am lodging my complaint so others will be aware. This is the 3rd Subaru we have owned and this has never occurred with the two Foresters we owned.This is a SAFETY concern as the battery just dies without warning....anywhere, any time....
The battery drained suddenly and unexpectedly overnight. The last it was driven was during the day and I'm certain that no lights had been left on. This easily could have stranded me somewhere unsafe if the drain had not happened at home.
I have a 2017 Subaru Outback.  It rained hard Monday night into Tuesday.  When I got in my car  Tuesday am to take my kids to school, there a small crack, maybe 3 inches, there was no crack previously.  As I drove my kids to school we watched the crack grow larger and larger.  There was no debris or anything near the windshield when we got it.  It seems to me that a windshield should be able to withstand a hard rain.  I googled it and it seems that Subaru's have problem with their windshields and it doesn't seem right.  Thank you
Battery prematurely dies.  I have replaced it 3 times in the short life of the car.  It's especially a problem when I'm running errands and make several stops, turning.off vehicle.  It struggles to start and maybe by 4th stop, it doesn't start and I'm left stranded.  There is something draining the battery and it's not reliable.
Placing car in park and attempt to remove key. Key remains locked in ignition. Car remains in the ON position with steering wheel NOT locked and radio/lights ON.  I must re-start the car, put in drive, rock gear shift and slam back into Park.  This procedure eeds to be repeated until the key can be removed. It is occurring with increasing frequency, at least once per day at this point.
On six separate occasions four times with out any battery drain and twice when I had charged my phone after turning off the engine the battery failed to start the car. It had to be jumped with a portable charger. The car has 62000 miles on it and no warning lights or any other indicators. On my last oil change 7/12/2021 it was tested and just crossed the line into the red and needs to be replaced.
We were driving along the highway when the windshield began to crack at the edge of the driver's side. We parked the car and went shopping for an hour. When we came back, the crack had doubled in length. I see, and know, there are issues with the windshield for this model year (a friend of mine had his replaced for free a couple of years ago). Need to get on that list.
BATTERY HAS FULLY  DRAINED AT LEAST FIVE TIMES. TOOK IT TO DEALER AND THEY FOUND NOTHING.    I HAVE PURCHASED A MOBI POWER CELL FOR JUMPING  THIS OUTBACK.
BATTERY DRAINS PREMATURELY? I'VE HAD TO HAVE IT JUMP STARTED 3 TIMES IN THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS. HAD IT CHECKED OUT & BATTERY, ALTERNATOR, AND STARTER ARE FINE. BATTERY JUST DEAD IN THE DRIVEWAY IN THE MORNING. ROADSIDE ASSIST GUY RECOMMENDED FILING A REPORT BECAUSE HE'D HEARD OTHERS HAD HAD PROBLEMS, TOO, POSSIBLY WITH BACK HATCH NOT CLOSING PROPERLY CAUSING DOME LIGHTS TO STAY ON AND DRAIN BATTERY. DID FIND BACK DOME LIGHT ON 1 NIGHT, TURNED OFF LIGHT, AND RECLOSED HATCH. I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN DILIGENT SINCE BUT IT WAS DEAD AGAIN THIS MORNING ANYWAY. DATE LISTED BELOW IS MOST RECENT INCIDENT. PREVIOUS 2 INCIDENTS WERE ABOUT A WEEK AGO AND ABOUT 2-3 DAYS APART.
IN JANUARY OF 2020, CAR WITH44659 MILES UNEXPECTEDLY WOULD NOT START, REQUIRING A AAA JUMP, AND THEN PURCHASE OF NEW BATTERY.  11 MONTHS LATER, ON 2/1/2021 CAR WITH 55153 MILES WOULD AGAIN NOT STOP. AAA HAD TO JUMP START.  WE DROVE VEHICLE TO A LOCAL DEALER WHO CLAIMED THAT BATTERY WAS NOW FULLY RECHARGED, AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.  WE PURCHASED AND NOW CARRY AN EMERGENCY BATTERY CHARGER WITH US OUT OF FEAR OF THIS OCCURRING AGAIN.
CAR WAS REAR ENDED (DRIVER SIDE REAR) AT FULL SPEED, WHICH THEN PUSHED US INTO A PARKING LOT, SPECIFICALLY THE CORNER WITH A CEMENT PILING WITH A LIGHT POLE WHICH COLLAPSED, NO AIRBAGS DEPLOYED.
AFTER 2 YEARS OF USE, THE OEM BATTERY WAS NOT KEEPING THE CHARGE OR WAS DRAINING DUE TO AN ISSUE WITH THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM. I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR JUMPED A COUPLE OF TIMES TO GET IT STARTED. BROUGHT THE CAR TO SUBARU DEALER AND THEY DID NOT FIND ANY ISSUES BUT REPLACED THE BATTERY WITH ANOTHER OEM BATTERY, QUITE UNUSUAL UNTIL I READ AN ARTICALE ABOUT A CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST SUBARU. IN 2020, THE NEW OEM BATTERY WAS HAVING ISSUES REQUIRING I JUMP IT SEVERAL TIMES. I WAS AWAY FROM HOME AT THE TIME AND BROUGHT THE CAR TO ADVANCED AUTO PARTS. THEY TESTED THE 2ND OEM BATTERY AND ADVISED THE BATTERY WAS BAD AND NOT HOLDING THE CHARGE. AT THAT TIME I PURCHASED A DIEHARD BATTERY AND HAVE HAD NO ISSUES IN THE LAST 6 MONTHS. AS I STATED ABOVE, I HAVE READ THAT SUBARU IS IN A CLASS ACTION SUIT FOR THE EXACT ISSUE I HAD AND WANTED TO HAVE THIS ISSUE RECORDED.
A NEW BATTERY DIED AFTER 7 MONTHS USE. I REPLACED IT. THE NEWER ONE DIED IN 5 DAYS.  I READ THERE IS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ABOUT THIS MODEL DRAINING BATTERIES PREMATURELY.  EACH TIME, WE WENT TO USE THE VEHICLE, STATIONARY, AND FOUND THE BATTERY COMPLETELY DEAD.
ON CURVY MOUNTAINOUS ROADS AT OR BELOW POSTED SPEEDS, THE EYESIGHT SYSTEM BRAKES ENGAGE DANGEROUSLY (E.G., TRAFFIC) AND UNEXPECTEDLY. THE EYESIGHT SYSTEM IS INCORRECTLY SENSING HILLSIDES AS HAZARDS. THE EYESIGHT ALARM IS SIMILARLY TRIGGERED ON STREET INTERSECTIONS.
THE CAR BATTERY HAS BEEN COMPLETELY DEAD TWICE WHEN PARKED IN AIRPORT LOT FOR SEVERAL DAYS. ONCE THE BATTERY WAS COMPLETELY DEAD IN THE HOME GARAGE WHEN IT HADN'T BEEN DRIVEN FOR SEVERAL DAYS. EACH TIME THE BATTERY HAD TO BE JUMPED. THE BATTERY WAS REPLACED AT OUR EXPENSE THE FIRST TIME BECAUSE WE ASSUMED WE LEFT AN INTERIOR LIGHT ON. WE ARE SAD TO DISCOVER THERE IS AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM THAT SUBARU WILL NOT FIX.
MULTIPLE TIMES THE TAILGATE HAS SPONTANEOUSLY OPENED WHEN WE WERE NOT IN THE VEHICLE. ASIDE FROM ISSUES LIKE RUNNING THE BATTERY DOWN, INCLEMENT WEATHER DAMAGING THE INTERIOR AND THE THEFT OF CONTENTS OF THE CAR ARE ISSUES. THUS FAR, THE CAR HAS NOT BEEN IN MOTION WHEN IT HAPPENED, BUT THERE WAS A LEAST ONE INCIDENT REPORTED WHERE A VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION WHEN THIS HAPPENED (SEE ATTACHED COMPLAINTS OF OTHER OWNERS.)THIS IS NOT A CASE OF ACCIDENTALLY ACTIVATING THE KEY FOB - IT HAS HAPPENED WHEN THE CAR WAS TURNED OFF AND SOMEONE WAS SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. THE ONLY KEY WAS IN A PURSE IN THE BACK SEAT.  THE PASSENGER WITNESSED THE CAR TAILGATE JUST SPONTANEOUSLY OPENING. IT HAS HAPPENED WHEN WE RETURNED TO THE CAR AFTER BEING AT AN APPOINTMENT, WHILE STAYING AT A MOTEL, AND WHEN THE CAR WAS PACKED FOR A TRIP THE NIGHT BEFORE.  WE ARE VERY CONCERNED THIS COULD HAPPEN WHEN THE CAR IS IN MOTION, CREATING A DEADLY HAZARD FOR OTHER VEHICLES.  WE HAVE FOUND THIS PROBLEM REPORTED BY NUMEROUS OWNERS OF THIS MODEL. THE LOCAL DEALER INITIALLY DISMISSED THE PROBLEM AS A CASE OF ACCIDENTALLY PRESSING THE KEY.  WE DISPUTED THIS AND THEY KEPT THE CAR FOR TWO DAYS TO SEE IF IT WOULD HAPPEN AND IT DID NOT.  SOMETIMES IT IS TWO MONTHS BETWEEN INCIDENTS.  THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND SAFETY HAZARD  THAT SUBARU NEEDS TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND CORRECT, PERHAPS NECESSITATING A RECALL. THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ANY CONVERSATION AMONG SERVICE DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE RECEIVED SIMILAR COMPLAINTS. IT'S JUST A SINGLE ISOLATED CASE AS FAR AS OUR LOCAL DEALER IS CONCERNED. I AM SUBMITTING A DOCUMENT THAT SHOWS MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS (AND NOT ALL) THAT OTHER SUBARU OWNERS HAVE BEEN REPORTING FOR YEARS.
I HAD A CRACK REPAIRED, IT ISN'T GOOD THOUGH.
BATTERY ISSUES ARE NON STOP! BATTERY DIES ALL THE TIME. WE HAD A NEW 2016 OUTBACK PREVIOUSLY, THAT HAD TO BE TOWED BECAUSE IT WOULD JUST DIE. WE TRADED IT IN FOR A NEW 2017 OUTBACK AND IT'S EVEN WORSE. BATTERY HAS BEEN REPLACED (NOT SURE HOW MANY TIMES), AND ISSUE IS STILL THE SAME. LEAVES US STUCK/STRANDED IN RANDOM PLACES, AND BACK HATCH WILL SOMETIMES BEEP NON STOP EVEN THOUGH IT'S COMPLETELY CLOSED. WE HAVE TO KEEP AN EMERGENCY JUMP KIT WITH US CONSTANTLY. THE BACK HATCH WON'T OPEN WHEN BATTERY IS DEAD/LOW, WHICH IS CRAZY THAT THERE ISN'T SOME TYPE OF OVERRIDE TO THIS.  I HAVE SEEN COUNTLESS BATTERY ISSUES FOR THIS VEHICLE AND I'M BEYOND SHOCKED THAT THIS HASN'T BEEN FIXED/ADDRESSED BY SUBARU. WE ARE FED UP WITH THE BATTERY DRAIN, AND DO EVERYTHING WE CAN SO WE CAN (HOPEFULLY) PROACTIVELY START OUR VEHICLE (HAVE ALL INTERIOR LIGHTS OFF, RADIO OFF, AIR OFF - ALL SYSTEMS POSSIBLE TURNED OFF). EVEN THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK. WE SPEND EXTRA MONEY ON GAS JUST TO RECHARGE THE CAR BY DRIVING IT MORE MILES  THAN WE WANT TO. I'M GONNA BE DONE WITH SUBARU AFTER THIS.
TL* THE CONTACT'S WIFE OWNS A 2017 SUBARU OUTBACK. THE CONTACT STATED WHILE HIS WIFE WAS DRIVING 35 MPH THROUGH A CONSTRUCTION ZONE, AN OBJECT HIT THE LOWER LEFT DRIVER'S SIDE WINDSHIELD WHICH LEFT TWO IMPRINTS ON THE WINDSHIELD. OVER TIME, THE WINDSHIELD CRACKED AND SPREAD ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE WINDSHIELD GLASS WAS POORLY MANUFACTURED AND THAT THE SIZE OF THE OBJECT THAT HIT HIS WIFE'S WINDSHIELD SHOULD NOT HAVE CAUSED THAT SEVERE OF DAMAGE. THE CONTACT ALSO STATED THAT THE CRACK THAT FORMED OVER THE WINDSHIELD HAD OBSTRUCTED HIS WIFE'S VISION WHILE DRIVING. ROY ROBINSON SUBARU (6001 33RD AVE NE, MARYSVILLE, WA 98271) WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE AND THEY REFERRED THE CONTACT TO AN INDEPENDENT GLASS CENTER TO REPLACE THE WINDSHIELD. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 66,000.
2017 SUBARU OUTBACK, CONSUMER WRITES IN REGARDS TO SAFETY SYSTEM MALFUNCTION. *LD    THE CONSUMER REQUESTED AN INVESTIGATION AN ACCIDENT BELIEVED TO BE CAUSED BY AN INCREASINGLY HIGHER VOLTAGE ELECTRICAL NATIONAL POWER GRID AND VEHICLES BEING PRODUCED WITH A HIGHER DEGREE OF COMPUTERIZED CONTROL SYSTEMS WITHOUT THE PROPER SHIELDING.*JS
I PURCHASED MY 2017 SUBARU OUTBACK IN MAY 2017.   ON OR AROUND 13 APRIL 2018 MY WINDSHIELD CRACKED AS I WAS DRIVING. NOTHING HIT THE WINDSHIELD INSIDE OR OUT. I DID HAVE THE WINDSHIELD DEFROST HEATER ON AND THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE WAS WELL ABOVE FREEZING (SF BAY AREA COLD - WHICH REALLY ISN'T COLD AT ALL).    I RESEARCHED AND FOUND OTHERS WITH THE SAME TYPICAL LOW CENTER CRACK WHICH PROGRESSED UP THE GLASS OVER SEVERAL DAYS.   THE DEALERSHIP DECLINED MY CLAIM.   I INITIATED A CLAIM THROUGH MY OWN INSURANCE. (STATE FARM).  I CONTACTED SUBARU OF AMERICA WHO SAID THEY WOULD COMPENSATE ME THE DIFFERENCE AFTER THE REPAIR.   I GOT THE WORK DONE AT THE DEALERSHIP AFTER A LENGTHY FIGHT OVER THE PHONE WITH A GROUP SUB CONTRACTED TO HANDLE THE CLAIM FOR STATE FARM. THEY TRIED TO GIVE ME CHEAP (NON-OEM GLASS)  I HAD TO FIGHT FOR OEM GLASS, STATING OVER AND OVER THAT I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE FOR THE EYESIGHT SYSTEM WHICH THE MANUFACTURER MANDATES OEM GLASS (WHAT A HEADACHE !!!)  I GOT THE WORK DONE - FINALLY, WITH OEM GLASS. DONE AT THE DEALERSHIP (BY YET ANOTHER SUB-CONTRACTOR). THE DEALERSHIP THEN RE-CALIBRATED THE EYESIGHT SYSTEM.  SOFA REIMBURSED ME THE DIFFERENCE. (SHOUT OUT TO [XXX]WHO LISTENED WITH EMPATHY THEN REIMBURSED MY DEDUCTIBLE - THANK YOU)  THE WHOLE AFFAIR WAS A REAL HEADACHE - I WAS TREATED LIKE I WAS NEGLIGENT OR TRYING TO GET OVER.  (I AM SUPER TENACIOUS - GOD HELP ANYONE WHO IS LESS SO, OR CANNOT BE PERSUASIVE -PUSHY).  AND NOW I AM LEFT WITH A SOUR TASTE AND FINGERS CROSSED THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. I AM NOT CONFIDENT WITH MY VEHICLE ANYMORE.  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).
CRACK IN THE FRONT WINDSHIELD AT THE TOP, PASSENGER SIDE CORNER. CRACK FOR NO REASON.  *TR
BATTERY DRAINS PREMATURELY. PURCHASED NEW IN DECEMBER 2017. PRIMARY USE IS SHORT-TRIP-DRIVING TO/FROM WORK. CAR FAILED TO START IN NOVEMBER 2019. CHARGED BATTERY AND TOOK IN FOR SERVICE. BATTERY REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY. PROBLEM REPEATED IN APRIL 2020.
WINDSHIELD CRACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WHILE DRIVING TO WORK ON A LOCAL STREETS STREET. IT'S THE BAY AREA IN CALI, SO THE WEATHER WAS AROUND 60 F. THERE WERE NO SIGN OR CHIPPED OR ANYTHING.
THE WINDSHIELD HAS CRACKED IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER AND HAS TRAVELED MORE THAN 15 INCHES TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE WINDSHIELD. THE CAUSE OF THE CRACK IS UNKNOWN
THE WINDSHIELD DEVELOPED A HORIZONTAL CRACK ON THE DRIVER SIDE ONLY A YEAR AND HALF INTO OWNERSHIP. NOTHING WAS OBSERVED TO HAVE STRUCK THE VEHICLE. THE CRACK WAS NOT THERE IN THE EVENING WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED IN OUR CARPORT. IT WAS OBSERVED WHEN WE WENT TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE IN THE MORNING (JULY 10, 2018). SAN DIEGO WAS EXPERIENCING AVERAGE SUMMER TEMPERATURES. THE WINDSHIELD WAS REPLACED AT OUR OWN COST, AS THE DEALERSHIP WOULD NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.    A SECOND CRACK IN THE EXACT SAME PLACE HAS APPEARED APPROXIMATELY 18 MONTHS LATER. AGAIN, THERE WAS NO CRACK WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED IN OUR DRIVEWAY IN THE EVENING. NOTHING STRUCK THE VEHICLE'S WINDSHIELD IN THE DAYS PRIOR. IN THE MORNING, WE CAME OUT TO AN IDENTICAL HORIZONTAL CRACK ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD (JANUARY 21, 2020). THE TEMPERATURE WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE WINTER AVERAGE (LOW OF 45F).    AS WE HAVE MOVED CITIES (SAN DIEGO TO PORTLAND), WE TOOK THE VEHICLE IN TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT, AS WE ALSO HAD A SAFETY RECALL THAT NEEDED TO BE FIXED. AGAIN, THE DEALERSHIP CLAIMED THAT IT WASN'T THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT SOMETHING MUST HAVE HIT THE WINDSHIELD AT EXACTLY THE SAME PLACE. THE MECHANIC DID NOT THINK THAT ANYTHING STRUCK THE VEHICLE. THE ASSISTANT MANAGER MOTIONED FOR HIM TO BE QUIET AND THEN TRIED TO CONVINCE MY WIFE THAT IT WAS A ROCK.
THE WINDSHIELD JUST CRACKED WHILE I WAS DRIVING ENTERING THE FREEWAY.  THERE WAS NO VEHICLE IN FRONT OF MINE WITHIN 150 FEET.  THERE IS NO MARK INDICATING AN IMPACT TO THE WINDSHIELD WHERE THE CRACK STARTS.
WITHIN A COUPLE WEEKS OF HAVING TO HAVE OUR WINDSHIELD FIXED, I WAS DRIVING STRAIGHT AHEAD ON A FREEWAY, APPROXIMATELY 70 MPH, WHEN A CRACK STREAKED ACROSS OUR WINDSHIELD. WE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHY, THINKING MAYBE A TINY ROCK HIT US. A FEW DAYS LATER WE ASKED SUBARU TO FIX IT, BUT THEY SAID THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY DO AND SENT US TO A LOCAL AUTO GLASS COMPANY. THEY SAID THESE NEW WINDSHIELDS WITH ALL THE TECHNOLOGY LIKE EYESIGHT, ETC. SEEM TO MAKE THE WINDSHIELDS MORE FRAGILE. ON JUNE 1ST, 2017 (OUR CAR WAS ONLY 6 MONTHS OLD), HAVING THE WINDSHIELD REPLACED, WE PICKED IT UP TO A TUNE OF $1,485.02. I WONDERED WHEN WE WOULD HAVE TO BE BACK IN FOR ANOTHER FIX. VERY CONCERNING.
MY OUTBACK HAS HORRIBLE WIND NOISE.  ITS SO LOUD I CANT USE THE BLUETOOTH PHONE, NOR LISTEN TO THE RADIO. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE AND WILL IMPACT MY NEXT PURCHASE.
DRIVING ON INTERSTATE AND SMALL PEBBLE STRUCK CENTER OF WINDSHIELD. AT THE TIME OF IMPACT NO VISUAL DAMAGE TO WINDSHIELD. DROVE APPROXIMATELY 5 MILES ON THE WAY TO HOME WHEN THE LOWER CENTER OF WINDSHIELD CRACKED.  CRACK IS ESTIMATED 8 INCHES IN DIAMETER.
I HAD THE ORIGINAL WINDSHIELD IN MY 2017 OUTBACK CRACK WHILE DRIVING ON I-65 BACK IN MARCH OF 2018, WHICH I PRESUMED WAS DUE TO A STONE CHIP EVEN THOUGH THE CHIP DAMAGE I OBSERVED WAS EXTREMELY MINOR. NOT KNOWING ABOUT THE ONGOING WINDSHIELD CRACKING ISSUES THAT SUBARU WAS UNDERGOING WITH THEIR 2015-2016 MODELS, I HAD THE CRACKED WINDSHIELD REPLACED AT MY DEALER WITH OEM PARTS ORDERED THROUGH MY DEALER'S PARTS DEPT. WHICH ENDED UP COSTING ME $500 OUT OF POCKET ON A $788 INSURANCE CLAIM. NOW I HAVE THE SAME KIND OF CRACK APPEARING IN THE REPLACEMENT WINDOW WITH NO APPARENT STONE CHIP OR OTHER CAUSE. I FIRST NOTICED THE CRACK ORIGINATE FROM THE AREA OF THE VIN WINDOW IN THE BOTTOM DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE WINDOW. THIS HAPPENED SOON AFTER I BEGAN DRIVING ON A QUITE COLD DAY WITH THE WINDSHIELD DEFOGGER ENGAGED. SINCE IT HAPPENED LESS THAN 1 YEAR AFTER THE FIRST, I ASKED THE SERVICE REP AT MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP IF THE REPLACEMENT WINDOW WAS COVERED BY ANY MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY AND HE SAID NO, NOT FOR CRACKING.   AFTER SEARCHING THE WINDSHIELD CRACKING PROBLEM ONLINE, I WAS SHOCKED TO READ OF THE NUMBER OF OTHER SUBARU LEGACY/OUTBACK OWNERS OF SIMILAR MODEL YEARS AND LATER WITH IDENTICAL STORIES AND WITH SUBARU APPARENTLY DUCKING THE ISSUE BY CONTENDING THAT THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WARRANTYING REPLACEMENT WINDOWS. NEEDLESS TO SAY I'M NOT HAPPY TO READ OF THEIR DODGING THIS POTENTIALLY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. I GUESS IT WILL TAKE ANOTHER CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT TO GET SUBARU TO STEP UP.
WE LIVE IN LA. WE BOUGHT OUR CAR NEW ON 5/31/17 FROM SUBARU OF SANTA MONICA. AT AROUND 6,000 MILES WE HAD ITS OIL CHANGED PRIVATELY IN DURANGO, CO, WHERE WE SPEND SUMMERS. BACK IN LA ON 12/17/17 WE WENT TO SUBARU OF SM FOR ANY REQUIRED ADDITIONAL SERVICE. THEY DECIDED TO PERFORM THE 12,000 SERVICE WITH 10,107 MILES ON THE CAR. WHEN SERVICE WAS COMPLETED, I DROVE THE CAR OFF. IT STALLED FOR MAYBE 5-10 SECONDS (BUT DIDN'T SHUT DOWN) ABOUT 100 YARDS FROM THE SERVICE AREA. INITIALLY, IT JUST WOULDN'T GO WHEN I DEPRESSED THE ACCELERATOR. I THEN REPEATEDLY DEPRESSED IT AND FINALLY THE TRANSMISSION SEEMED TO 'CATCH' AND THE CAR MOVED FORWARD NORMALLY. LATER, AT MY REQUEST, MY WIFE MET WITH THE SERVICE WRITER (A LADY) TELLING HER ABOUT THE STALLING. HER RESPONSE: THIS HAPPENS ON ALL SUBARUS'THEY OCCASIONALLY STALL FOR ABOUT 5 SECONDS.  SUBSEQUENTLY OUR CAR HAS STALLED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WITH MY WIFE DRIVING. AND IT ALSO HAPPENED TO ME AGAIN, THIS TIME AFTER ITS 24,000 SERVICE BY THE DURANGO SUBARU DEALER ON 10/10/18 (SEE SERVICE WRITE-UP). AS I WAS DRIVING AWAY, I STOPPED ON A DRIVEWAY BEFORE TURNING ONTO A CITY STREET. THAT'S WHEN THE CAR STALLED. [I HAD PREVIOUSLY TOLD THE SERVICE WRITER ABOUT THE STALLING, BUT THE DEALER'S MECHANIC COULDN'T GET IT TO STALL.]  THE TWO DESCRIBED STALLINGS OCCURRED WHEN THE CAR WAS STOPPED AND I WAS ABOUT TO TURN ONTO A CITY STREET.  WE JUST RECEIVED A CVT TRANSMISSION WARRANTY EXTENSION LETTER (SEE ENCLOSED) APPLICABLE ONLY TO 2016 AND 2017 SUBARUS (MOST MODELS) WHICH TELLS ME SUBARU KNOWS ALL ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND HAS FIXED IT ON ITS 2018 AND 2019 MODELS.  I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THERE BE A RECALL OF ALL 2016 AND 2017 SUBARU VEHICLES DESCRIBED IN THE ENCLOSED WARRANTY EXTENSION LETTER SO THAT THIS VERY FRIGHTENING PROBLEM CAN FIXED.  THANK GOD OUR OUTBACK DIDN'T STALL AT A TIME WHEN ONCOMING TRAFFIC WOULD HAVE PLOWED INTO IT.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2017 SUBARU OUTBACK. THE CONTACT STATED THAT INTERMITTENTLY WHILE THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS DEPRESSED, THE VEHICLE FAILED TO COME TO A COMPLETE STOP. THE CONTACT THEN STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO HEUBERGER SUBARU (1080 MOTOR CITY DR., COLORADO SPRINGS, CO 80905 (719) 475-1920) WHERE THE BRAKES NEEDED TO BE FLUSHED. THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED HOWEVER, THE FAILURE RECURRED. THE CONTACT THEN STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE DEALER WHERE NO DIAGNOSTIC FAILURE CODES WERE FOUND AND THE FAILURE COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE ISSUE WHERE THE FIELD ENGINEER ALONG WITH TECHNICIAN INSPECTED THE VEHICLE AND DETERMINED THAT NO FAILURE HAD OCCURRED, AND INFORMED THE CONTACT THAT THE ENGINE NEEDED TO BE WARMED. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS NOT AVAILABLE.
OPEN LETTER TO SUBARU AND SUBARU OWNERS. I HAVE A 2017 SUBARU OUTBACK. THE REASON I PURCHASED THE CAR WAS THE HIGH SAFETY RATINGS. I CAME HOME YESTERDAY, DROVE INTO THE GARAGE AND SHUT THE CAR OFF I THOUGHT. I APPARENTLY DID NOT PUSH THE START AND KILL BUTTON HARD ENOUGH. I AM HARD OF HEARING SO DID NOT NOTICE THE ENGINE STILL RUNNING. THIS CAR DOES NOT HAVE A REMOTE START. MY GARAGE DOOR AUTOMATICALLY CLOSES AFTER A PRESET TIME. I HAPPENED OUT TO THE GARAGE 3 HOURS LATTER TO FIND THE CAR ENGINE STILL RUNNING. I CAN NOT THE IMAGINE THE CARS COMPUTER ALLOWING THE ENGINE TO CONTINUE TO RUN FOR THREE HOURS WITHOUT THE KEY BEING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE VEHICLE. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION. IT WAS WELL OVER 100 DEGREES IN THE GARAGE PLUS THE CARBON MONOXIDE LEVEL WAS OUTRAGEOUS. IF THERE IS COMPUTER SETTING TO STOP THIS PLEASE LET ME KNOW.  RICHARD
FIRST BRAKING ISSUE (ALSO POWER TRAIN):  THE BRAKE PEDAL IS ONLY SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE HEIGHT OF THE GAS PEDAL.  CONSEQUENTLY, SEVERAL TIMES WHILE DRIVING, MY RIGHT FOOT HAS HIT BOTH THE BRAKE PEDAL AND THE GAS PEDAL SIMULTANEOUSLY, ESPECIALLY IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.  IN SUCH INSTANCE, THE RESULT IS A POWER SURGE WHILE BRAKING, POTENTIALLY EXTENDING THE STOPPING DISTANCE OF THE CAR.  OTHER CARS (NON-SUBARU) HAVE THE BRAKE PEDAL HIGHER, SO THIS SIMULTANEOUS APPLICATION OF BRAKES AND POWER IS LESS LIKELY TO HAPPEN.  THE DEALER'S SERVICE MANAGER SAYS THE HEIGHT OF THE BRAKE PEDAL IS NOT ADJUSTABLE, AND REFERS OWNERS TO SUBARU'S CUSTOMER RETAIL SERVICES.  SUBARU'S CUSTOMER RETAIL SERVICES CLAIMS THERE IS NO WAY TO ADJUST THE HEIGHT OF THE BRAKE PEDAL TO AVOID THIS PROBLEM.  SECOND BRAKING ISSUE:  UNLIKE OTHER CARS, THERE IS NO EMERGENCY HAND BRAKE OR FOOT BRAKE ON THE SUBARU, SO THE RISK OF AN ACCIDENT IS HIGH IF THE REGULAR BRAKES FAIL.  THE BRAKES HAVE NOT YET FAILED, BUT THERE SHOULD BE REDUNDANCY FOR THIS CRITICAL BRAKING FUNCTION.
FAULTY OCCUPANT DETECTION SYSTEM.    TURNS OFF AIRBAG WITH PASSENGER.  TURNS ON AIRBAG AND SEATBELT CHIME WITH NO PASSENGER/WEIGHT.  INTERMITTENT.  BRAND NEW CAR WITH 700 MILES AND BROUGHT IN 3 TIMES TO SUBARU SANTA MONICA.   SERVICE CENTER UNABLE TO REPLICATE PROBLEM, BUT I SENT THEM VIDEOS.
The contact owns a 2018 Subaru Outback. The contact stated that several unknown warning lights were illuminated on the instrument panel. The contact stated that the cruise control was inoperable. The contact was unable to connect to the radio or Bluetooth. The failure had progressed over time. The vehicle was taken to the local dealer, who was unable to determine the cause of the failure. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The contact stated that another unknown local dealer was contacted, but no assistance was provided. The contact stated that the failure was due to a previous crash. The manufacturer was contacted, but no additional assistance was provided. The approximate failure mileage was 26,000.
DSM drawing too much power from battery when car is parked. DSM drawing 0.151k ohms to 0.017.  Have complained to Subaru of Santa Cruz about this 3x. First they said it was the battery under recall and replaced the battery. Second time they thought I was leaving the key fob in the car (The fob is kept with me not in the car ).  Third time they said the DSM is pulling too much power from the battery.  Subaru has an extended warranty for the DSM for 2016-2018 outbacks but does not include my VIN number.  This power draw and dead battery has put me in San Francisco late at night without a functional car.  I did not have this independently evaluated before Subaru did a "jump box replacement" for $775.73.
The contact owns a 2018 Subaru Outback. The contact stated while driving at an undisclosed speed, the windshield cracked without impact. The contact took the vehicle to a dealer to have the windshield replaced; however, the failure recurred soon after the replacement. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired by an independent mechanic or dealer. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 75,000.
My sunroof spontaneously combusted while driving, without anything hitting the vehicle or any pre-existing damage. The glass shattered everywhere while going down the highway.
Vehical infotainment system constantly beeps and changes formats, including randomly dialing phone numbers while driving. turning volume down does not control the distraction and system cannot be turned off. beeping is so load, it can be heard from 20 feet away from the car (outside of vehicle). the distraction is a safety problem for the driver. problem is in effect over 6 monthes and unit cannot be replaced due to product unavailability.
Driver seat is loose. Noise when travelling or even stopped. Bolts to the floor are tight but the seat is loose above them. Excess movement. Brought it in after 2 weeks of new purchase and they repaired bushings according to service. Noise recurs 2022. Dealer refuses to repair under any warranty. Suggests bottom seat replacement at owners expense.
I was changing the passenger side wiper blade, and when the wiper was lowered to the windshield, the windshield cracked.  The crack is now moving up towards the forward eyesight detection system.
Eye Sight Blind Spot Warning indicator on each side view mirror does not function intermittently: blind spot warning indicator light does not light up when cars are in blind spot. Eye Sight Rear Cross Traffic Warning camera does not function intermittently in Reverse gear:  screen turns black OR camera shows cross traffic AND sound alert does not sound.
During a photography trip of May 2021, in a very remote area, the Outback's rear gate  was kept opened for my dog for a few hours. When it was time to leave, the battery wouldn't start. Luckily, I had a battery charger. There was nobody present to help in this area and no mobile phone service available. Later in the day, the battery died again, under the same circumstance. We were fortunate to have extra food, water, and blankets if needed to survive the night.  I thought maybe the battery was old. I replaced the battery on May 24, 2021 with an Optima 25 battery. This is a better battery than what Subaru installs. This February 2022, we went camping in a remote area of Death Valley with no available services. The fairly new car battery wouldn't start.  I used my emergency starter again. This time the rear door and  side doors had been opened constantly due to camping activity. It was not possible to disable the lights so as not to drain the battery.
We have a 2018 Subaru Outback with 87,000.  As of yesterday our car is now on its third battery.  The original battery lasted about a two years, then we purchased one from Autozone, that battery only lasted 15 months.  There is obviously an issue with the electrical system on these cars causing the battery to have a shortened life span.  With so many electronics in the car it seems the battery may be to small, it is only a 25 series battery.  It could possibly be there are issues with the electrical system cause constant drain.  We do know that the car showed no real signs of battery failure before the battery is dead.  No slow starting, dim headlights, etc.  Both batteries were working well, until all of a sudden they did not.  I have read online where this seems to be a real problem with these cars from 2016 to 2019 and possibly the 2020 models.
Rear view camera freezes up. When in Reverse it stays frozen. Rendering the rear safety camera inoperative. Definitely a safety issue. Has been to dealer multiple times to repair this problem. And it still is happening.
Battery is not keeping charge, unable to start vehicle even after daily driving. With an infant, we need something more reliable, being stranded is not an option. Vehicle has not been inspected, upon further review this is a constant problem with lawsuits requesting for a resolution against Subaru. Battery indicator light would turn on and lights would flash when able.
I bought a new 2018 Subaru Outback in June 2018. It has been a very good vehicle except for the CVT which Subaru has had issues with for years.   The CVT hesitates and shudders and detracts from the performance and safety of the vehicle.   I have spoken with the dealer as well as Subaru of America They have extended the CVT warranty to 10 years 100k miles but only if the CVT breaks to the point where the vehicle will not operate. I do all my service at the dealer and have asked if Subaru would replace the CVT to make it run better and safely. They said that Subaru will only do that if and when the CVT breaks and does not operate.   I would hope that NHTSA can get Subaru to replace the CVT if it operates in an inferior way.
WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN WE HEARD A CRACK AND THE CRACK APPEARED ON THE WINDSHIELD IN A T  FORMATION. THIS HAPPENED 12/2018. THE CRACK AT THIS TIME COVERS THE MAJORITY OF THE WINDSHIELD IN A T FORMATION.
TTHE BATTERY HAS GONE DEAD SEVERAL TIMES.  THE DEALER REPLACED THE BATTERY ONE TIME UNDER WARRANTY.  IT NOW INDICATES A WEAKNESS IN CRANKING POWER AFTER THE CAR SITS WITHOUT DRIVING FOR A FEW DAYS.  IT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED WITH A NEW AND MORE POWERFUL BATTERY.
WINDSHIELD CRACKED AND WITHIN 3 DAYS RAN ACROSS MOST OF THE ENTIRE WIDTH OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD.
THE FRONT WINDSHIELD DEVELOPS CRACKS AND STAR CHIPS FOR NO APPARENT REASON.  HAD IT REPAIRED WITH HANSON AUTO GLASS 3 DIFFERENT OCCASIONS IN THE 2 YEARS OF OWNERSHIP.  ONLY ABLE TO FIND 2 OF 3 PICTURES OF REPAIR PAPERWORK.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2018 SUBARU OUTBACK. THE CONTACT STATED THAT WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED, SHE NOTICED THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WAS CRACKED. THE CONTACT STATED WHILE DRIVING  55 MPH, THE FRONT WINDSHIELD CRACKED WITHOUT IMPACT. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO MILLER SUBARU (1592 NJ-38, LUMBERTON, NJ 08048, (609)267-4000) WHERE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE WINDSHIELD NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED HOWEVER, THE FAILURE RECURRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS CONTACTED HOWEVER, NO FURTHER ASSISTANCE WAS PROVIDED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 37,000.
WINDSHIELD CRACKED WHEN PARKED IN DRIVEWAY
BATTERY DIED MANY TIMES. CAR IS JUST UNDER 3 YEARS OLD, WITH 18,000 MILES  STILL UNDER WARRANTY. DEALER SAID THE CAR MUST BE LEFT THAT THEY NEEDED TO TEST. THE CCA RATING IS 300 SOMETHING. A FRIEND IN COLORADO HAS A 2019 FORESTER WITH A CCA OF 620! VERY SIMILAR ENGINE, BOTH MODELS ARE TOURING. COULD IT BE THAT VEHICLES IN LESS COLDER AREAS ARE FITTED WITH INADEQUATE BATTERY CCA SO SUBARU CAN SAVE A FEW DOLLARS?  ALSO THE RAB LIGHT CAME ON WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. HOW IS THAT OK? THE INFOTAINMENT SCREEN HAS FROZEN MULTIPLE TIMES. WHEN IT DID THE VOLUME OF THE RADIO COULD NOT BE LOWERED..I WAS PARKED WHEN IT HAPPENED, (RADIO WAS LOUD) THEN STARTED DRIVING AND COULDN'T LOWER IT..  PLEASE NOTE:  THESE ELECTRICAL ISSUES OCCURRED AT DIFFERENT TIMES ... I HAVE NO IDEA IF THEY'RE RELATED
VEHICLE HAS 17,000 MILES, BATTERY HAS DIED AT LEAST 6 TIMES.  BATTERY HAS BEEN FOUND DRAINED IN THE AM AFTER BEING PARKED IN GARAGE.  DEALER REPLACED BATTERY AT 16,000 MILES.  BATTERY PROBLEM STILL EXISTS. SUBARU TRIES TO EXPLAIN PROBLEM BY STATING INTERIOR  LIGHTS ARE LEFT ON OR KEY WAS LEFT TO CLOSE TO CAR.  TESTS SHOW THERE WAS NO PARASITIC   DRAIN ON BATTERY.  SUBARU DOES NOT WANT TO FIX OR ADMIT THE PROBLEM.
AFTER REPLACING THE WINDSHIELD ONCE WITH OEM GLASS.  IT CRACKED AGAIN, IN ROUGHLY THE SAME PLACE AS BEFORE (BOTTOM MIDDLE OF WINDSHIELD).  THIS IS THE SECOND WINDSHIELD IN LESS THAN 2 YEARS!  SUBARU CLEARLY HAS A PROBLEM WITH THEIR GLASS OR CLEARANCES AROUND THE GLASS.  THIS ONE CRACKED WHILE SITTING IN A CARIBOU PARKING LOT.  WE WERENT EVEN MOVING.  NO ROCK CHIPS, NOTHING HIT THE WINDOW.  ALL THE SUDDEN HEARD A "POP" NOISE, THEN SAW THE CRACK.
BATTERY WAS DEAD IN MAY 2020. PURCHASED NEW BATTERY 5/28/2020. NEW BATTERY WAS DEAD 6/4/2020. NEW BATTERY HAD LASTED ONLY 7 DAYS.  *TR
WINDSHIELD SUDDENLY CRACKED WHILE STATIONARY
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2018 SUBARU OUTBACK. THE CONTACT STATED THE FRONT WINDSHIELD ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE CRACKED. THE CRACK RUNS FROM THE FAR LEFT CORNER ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE JUST IN THE MIDDLE AT THE REAR VIEW MIRROR. THE CRACK WAS CAUSED BY A SMALL PEBBLE BOUNCING OFF THE ROAD. THE CONTACT MENTIONED IT WAS THE SECOND OCCURRENCE WITH THE WINDSHIELD CRACKING. THE DEALER BUD CLARY AUTO GROUP (1030 COMMERCE AVE, LONGVIEW, WA 98632 (360) 423-1700) REFERRED THE CONTACT TO AN AUTO GLASS COMPANY WHO REPLACED THE WINDSHIELD. THE MANUFACTURER HAD NOT BEEN CONTACTED YET. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 5,000.
WINDSHIELD CRACKS EASILY AND QUICKLY. AFFECTS SAFETY/CAMERA AND SENSORS. A SMALL CHIP APPEARED ON THE WINDSHIELD, UNDER COLD TEMPERATURES IN KANSAS 2020 JANUARY, CHIP GREW A CRACK EXTENDING FROM DRIVER TO PASSENGER SIDE
OUR 2018 OUTBACK ALMOST KILLED MY HUSBAND. HE WAS GETTING INTO THE CAR (IT WAS RUNNING) AND JUST OPENED THE DOOR, WHEN THE CAR ROLLED BACK. HE WAS PINNED BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE GARAGE FRAME AND FORTUNATELY THE HE WAS ABLE TO ROLL INTO THE GARAGE. HE HIT SO HARD AND LANDED ON THE SIDE OF HIS MOUNTAIN BIKE (WAS INSIDE THE DOOR) THAT IT PUNCHED A HOLE THROUGH THE WALL. I CAME OUT TO FIND HIM LAYING ON THE GROUND IN THE GARAGE AND THE CAR SITTING IN MY DRIVEWAY JUST OUTSIDE THE GARAGE. THERE IS A NATURAL SLOPE AND IT WAS STOPPED WHERE IT LEVELS OFF. THE DOOR ENDED UP BEING CAUGHT ON THE FRAME OF THE GARAGE AND OPENED ALL THE WAY AND THEN SOME BEFORE SLAMMING BACK. THE DOOR IS NOT FUNCTIONAL AND IT DAMAGED THE FRONT QUARTER PANEL AS WELL AS THE DRIVER DOOR. THIS IS MY 3RD OUTBACK AND I AM BEYOND HORRIFIED OF THIS CAR! WE HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS FROM IT SINCE WE HAVE HAD IT AND I AM READY TO GET RID OF THIS ONE! DO NOT BUY THIS YEAR! THERE WAS A RECALL ON AN EARLIER YEAR OUTBACK AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS AS THEY WERE DOING THE SAME THING, ROLLING WHEN IN PARK. THIS CAR COULD HAVE KILLED HIM AND HE IS FORTUNATE HE WAS ABLE TO GET AWAY FROM THE CAR AND THE FRAME. I CALLED SUBARU THIS MORNING AND HAVE A CASE SO WE SHALL SEE IF I HAVE TO GET LEGAL INVOLVED OR NOT.
I HAD OWNED MY 2018 SUBARU OUTBACK FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS. I WAS DRIVING ON A STATE HIGHWAY WHEN MY WINDSHIELD WAS HIT WITH A SMALL ROCK. IT CAUSED A SMALL CRACK IN THE WINDSHIELD. I USUALLY CAN GET TO TOWN AND HAVE THESE FILLED WHEN THIS HAS HAPPENED IN MY OTHER VEHICLE. BY THE TIME I DROVE THE 20 MILES TO TOWN TO GET IT FILLED IT HAD RAN AND CRACKED THE WHOLE MIDDLE SECTION OF MY WINDSHIELD.  I WAS SHOCKED THAT IT HAD COMPLETELY RUINED THE WINDSHIELD. I CALLED MY DEALER WHO INFORMED ME IT WOULD COST ABOUT $600 TO $700 TO REPLACE THE WINDSHIELD. AND ABOUT 500 TO CALIBRATE THE EYESIGHT ON THE CAR.   AGAIN I WAS SHOCKED. HE THEN REFERRED ME TO A WINDSHIELD COMPANY IN MY AREA TO REPLACE IT AT A $350 COST TO ME. I DID NOT TAKE ANY PICTURES AS I DID NOT REALIZE THIS WAS GOING TO BE A THING WITH THE VEHICLE. SINCE THEN I HAVE HAD OVER 8 CHIPS FIXED IN THE WINDSHIELD. IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME I TRAVEL IT GETS HIT. WHICH IS STRANGE BECAUSE MY OTHER VEHICLE VERY SELDOM GETS HIT. I TRY NOT TO DRIVE BEHIND VEHICLES AS IT SEEMS MY WINDSHIELD IS IN AN ANGLE THAT IS HIT IF ANYTHING COMES UP OFF THE ROAD.  THIS IS FRUSTRATING AND EXPENSIVE AND MESSES WITH MY EYESIGHT ON THE CAR.
WINDSHIELD CRACKED FOR NO REASON KNOWN - I MY VEHICLE WAS PARKED IN THE GARAGE UPON GETTING INTO MY VEHICLE TO FOLLLOWING MORNING I NOTICED A CRACK THAT GROW SIGNIFICANTLY WITHIN A DAY HAD TO HAVE IT REPLACED A FEW MONTHS AFTER PURCHASING   FUEL CAPACITY DOES NOT REGISTER CORRECTLY - I DID HAVE THE RECALL DONE BUT IT STILL DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY
CAR DEVELOPED A CRACK ON WINDSHIELD OVERNIGHT WHILE PARKED IN AN INDOOR PARKING GARAGE. A FEW DAYS LATER CRACK GREW IN SIZE AGAIN WHILE PARKED IN A DIFFERENT INDOOR PARKING GARAGE. CAR HAS ~33,000 MILES AND WAS NOT HIT BY ANY ROAD DEBRIS.
A LARGE CRACK, LIKE THE SHAPE OF A QUESTION MARK, SPONTANEOUSLY APPEARED IN MY WINDSHIELD.  THE CRACK STARTS BELOW THE WINDSHIELD WIPER, UP ABOUT 7 INCHES AND CURVES BACK DOWN.  CAR WAS MOVED OUT OF OUR GARAGE AND PARKED IN DRIVEWAY WHEN THE CRACK APPEARED!!!!!
THE ENTIRE "INFOTAINMENT" SYSTEM, CENTRAL DISPLAY CONSOLE, AND CONTROL PANEL DOES NOT WORK. IT WILL NOT TURN ON. THE SCREEN IS BLACK. NOTHING WORKS. THE REAR VIEW CAMERA SAFETY SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK. THE RADIO, BLUETOOTH, AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK. THIS SYMPTOM IS CONSTANT. IT OCCURS WHEN STATIONARY, IN MOTION, IN CITY, HIGHWAY, TURNING - ALWAYS. IN REVERSE THE REARVIEW CAMERA DOES NOT DISPLAY AN IMAGE. THE HANDS FREE CALLING SYSTEM/BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK - AGAIN, THIS ISSUE IS CONSTANT REGARDLESS OF CONDITIONS.
BACKUP CAMERA IS BLACK GPS AND RADIO DEAD
I WAS DRIVING AND THE FUEL INDICATOR INDICATED 70 MILES TO GO LAST TIME I SAW IT. I ONLY HAD TO DRIVE 10 MILES HOME AND THE CAR SUDDENLY STOPPED, THANKFULLY ON A LOCAL ROAD. SOME WARNING LIGHTS STARTED APPEARING AND I COULDNT MAKE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. I TRIED TO RESTART A FEW TIMES UNTIL I DECIDED IT HAD TO BE FUEL. WE PUSHED CAR TO SIDE OF ROAD AND WENT TO GAS STATION TO GET GAS. CAME BACK WITH GAS, REFILLED AND CAR STARTED AND WENT HOME. I THOUGHT IT WAS MY FAULT, ALTHOUGHT I COULDNT EXPLAIN WHY THE LAST TIME A SAW THE FUEL GAUGE SAID 70 MILES AND I WAS JUST GOING HOME, NOT EVEN 10 MILES TO GET THERE.
RAN OUT OF GAS WHEN GAUGE SHOWED 40 MILES LEFT  - CAR LOCKED UP ON A 70MPH FREEWAY - REPORTED TO SUBARU ALMOST A YEAR AGO AND RECENTLY SAW WHERE A RECALL HAD BEEN INITIATED BUT CALLED SUBARU CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHEN THIS WILL BE RESOLVED EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE KNOW ABOUT IT FOR A YEAR - WHY IS THIS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE THAT THE NHTSA IS FORCING THEM TO FIX
I RECENTLY PURCHASED A 2018 OUTBACK. I WAS DRIVING IT GOING ABOUT 25 MPH ON ROAD BY MY HOUSE AND IT SHUT DOWN OUT OF NOWHERE, DASH LIGHTS CAME ON, GAS PEDAL WOULDN'T WORK, THE ONLY WAY I GOT IT TO GO WAS SHUTTING IT OFF COMPLETELY AND RESTARTING IT.    THEY CAR HAS 3500 MILES, I DROPPED IT OFF AT THE DEALERSHIP ON 8/25 AND THEY HAVE HAD IT SINCE. THEY REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP SAYING IT WAS THE CAUSE OF IT SHUTTING DOWN ON ME.    I RECEIVED THE CAR BACK ON 9/21 AND DROVE IT FOR 180 MILES, THIS TIME AT 65 MPH THE CAR SHUTDOWN AGAIN WHILE I WAS TRYING TO PASS SOMEONE ON A 2 LANE ROAD, POWER STEERING LOST AND ALL LIGHTS CAME ON DASHBOARD LIKE IT HAD SOME TYPE OF ELECTRICAL PROBLEM. VERY SIMILAR TO THE FIRST TIME BUT I WAS DRIVING MUCH FASTER THIS TIME.AFTER ABOUT 30 SECONDS THE CAR JUST KIND OF STARTED UP BY ITSELF WITHOUT ME HAVING TO PUSH THE START BUTTON    I BELIEVE THIS ISSUE IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE AND COULD POSSIBLY GET ME KILLED OR SOMEONE ELSE KILLED WHILE DRIVING THIS CAR.    SUBARU SERVICE FACILITY HAS NO CLUE WHATS GOING ON SINCE THE CAR IS NOT THROWING CODES. I HAVE STARTED THE LEMON LAW PROCESS BUT SUBARU IS NOT BEING VERY HELPFUL THUS FAR.       ALSO HAVING A PROBLEM WITH PASSENGER SEAT NOT SENSING IF SOMEONE IS SITTING IN THE SEAT AND NOT ENABLING THE AIRBAGS. THIS PROBLEM CAME UP ON THE SCAN ON 8/25 ANALYSIS. I WAS UNAWARE OF THE ISSUE, NOTHING IN THE CAR TOLD ME PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG WAS NOT WORKING. SUBARU REPLACED THE SEAT BUT I AM STILL CONCERNED THAT THE PROBLEM IS GOING ON SINCE I HAVE NO WAY TO TELL IF IT WORKS OR NOT.
I HAVE 6000 MILES ON MY 2018 SUBARU OUTBACK AND  RODENTS ATE THE ELECTRICAL WIRES IN MY ENGINE WHICH CAUSED ME NOT TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE THE CAR AND COULD HAVE CAUSED A MAJOR ACCIDENT. I FOUND OUT MY WIRES ARE SOY BASED WHICH ATTRACTED THE RODENTS.I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN MY DASHBOARD INDICATORS LIT UP INDICATING THERE WAS A PROBLEM. I IMMEDIATELY DROVE TO THE SUBARU SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND HAD THE WIRING REPAIRED.  IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SUBARU TO REPLACE ALL MY WIRING WITH NON-SOY BASED WIRING AT NO COST TO ME IMMEDIATELY AND GIVE ME A LOANER CAR WITHOUT SOY BASED WIRING UNTIL MY CAR HAS BEEN REPAIRED. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ALL CARS ON THE ROAD ARE HAZARD FREE.
8" NAVIGATION/DISPLAY FROZEN.  NO BACK-UP CAMERA WHEN IN REVERSE. DOES NOT RESPOND TO INPUTS EITHER ON THE DISPLAY OR FROM STEERING WHEEL. "POWER" SWITCH DID NOT POWER DOWN THE UNIT. STOPPING THE ENGINE AND RESTARTING DID NOT RESET THE UNIT.  STOPPING THE ENGINE, OPEN AND CLOSE THE DRIVERS DOOR AND RESTARTING DID NOT RESET THE UNIT.  REMAINED INOPERATIVE DURING MORNING COMMUTE (30 MIN). CENTER CONSOLE REMAINED ON AFTER EXITING AND LOCKING THE CAR.  AFTER 9 HOURS THE BATTERY WAS DRAINED AND THE ENGINE WOULD NOT START. AFTER A JUMP-START, THE UNIT DID RESET AND SEEMS TO BE WORKING NORMALLY.  THERE SHOULD BE A WAY TO POWER-DOWN (REBOOT) THE  NAVIGATION/RADIO DISPLAY WITHOUT HAVING TO STOP THE CAR AND RESTART THE ENGINE.
2019 Subaru Outback passenger side cam carrier started to seep at 42k miles. 63K continues to seep and Subaru suggested monitoring oil levels. Estimated cost to fix $6k. If leak gets worse and/or proper monitoring of oil in the engine is not done could lead to engine failure and costly repairs.
Subaru settled a class action lawsuit regarding faulty battery and DMC component that drains the battery continuously. My dealer just replaced my battery and DCM under warranty (I'm assuming the warranty is a result of the lawsuit). However, this does not ultimately remedy the problem. The new DMC will continue to draw on the battery causing future reoccurring issues. Subaru needs to make good on this problem in a permanent way.
The surface of the interior touch screen display on my 2019 Subaru Outback Touring that controls the radio, navigation, phone, vehicle settings and information, and rear backup camera assistance developed bubbles and presses buttons on its own. It toggles between apps, calls people, changes radio stations, adjusts volume, discontinues map routes, removes backup camera footage, and beeps at random and while driving. As a driver or passenger I am unable to control these functions because the touch screen is not functional. The safety of myself and others has absolutely been put at risk: a once reliable backup camera is no longer consistently functional; the route I set in the driveway disappears, reappears, and changes destination locations while I'm driving; at times the screen toggles and beeps quickly, will not stay turned off, and creates an unavoidable visual and audible distraction. Phil Long Subaru inspected my vehicle, confirmed that this is a known issue with United Radio part #AL58A, and quoted the repair at over $1600. Subaru of America has not issued a recall despite two class action lawsuits for this issue and an existing recall for the same issue on earlier models. SOA offered a one time credit of $1200, which leaves me on the hook for $500 for their defective manufacturing, and no guarantee that the replacement part has been modified to address the issue or extended warranty on the part in case this happens again. There were no warnings, messages, or symptoms of the problem prior to failure. The bubbles appeared around October 2024 and the ability to consistently control the display was lost immediately.
BATTERY failures and being stranded due to parasitic loads from DCM.
Infotainment system is not working correctly. Delamination causes the system to malfunction causing a distraction. I took it to a Subaru dealer and was told what the problem was but if I wanted to have it assessed it would cost more than $100 and a replacement would be over $1300. I was also informed that if Subaru was to replace it, it would be with the same system.  I was told by the technician there is a class action suit lodged against Subaru for other years for this issue, but not for 2019. There were no warning messages.
windshield cracked and replaced
I subscribe to Subaru Star Link from the time I first purchased our Outback in 2019.  The system does not continuously perform correctly. I have taken our Outback  to the dealer and they try to recalibrate the unit, but  it does not continue to perform correctly.  In March of 2023 I was in an accident and Star Link did not notify the police.  When we called the police they stated that they received no notification from Star Link.  On February 23, 2024 youngsters tried to break into our Outback the Police saw this incident and expressed surprise that Star Link gave them no notification.  Can not manage to get Star Link to continuously work.  Unit does not give traffic warnings.
The radio receiver is defective as it experiences ghost touches and changes screens by itself while driving. This causes it to change settings, remove paired devices, open apps, change the radio stations, and several other things. As one could imagine, this is a major distraction while driving. I purchased the car working flawlessly in June of 2023. The issues did not arise until after a few hot days happened in FL around August of 2023 and I noticed the screen started to form bubbles. The touch screen is now inoperable so I am unable to change the clock, use navigation, reset maintenance reminders, or use any other built-in functions. Luckily the backup camera still works but can be hard to see in certain lighting. Previous model year Subarus were covered under a class action lawsuit for experiencing similar issues but not 2019. The last time I took my vehicle in for service, the service rep had mentioned they were unable to reset my maintenance reminder due to the touchscreen being unresponsive. I reached out to Subaru of America to ask for assistance in getting it resolved. They offered to pay $1,000 of the over $2,800 repair quote I received from my local Subaru dealer. Since an OEM unit will most likely do the same thing after a period of time, I looked into an aftermarket replacement as well. I was quoted around $1,100 to get a new aftermarket receiver and maintain majority of the factory "creature comforts" like steering wheel controls, backup camera, and vehicle information. I have attached pictures that are from September 2023, December 2023, and January 2024.
The contact owns a 2019 Subaru Outback. The contact stated that the head unit had delaminated, and the GPS unit was inoperable. The contact stated that the radio volume increased to high independently. Additionally, the GPS made phantom calls. There were no warning lights illuminated. The vehicle was taken to the local dealer, where it was diagnosed that the GPS unit was delaminated and needed to be replaced. The contact was informed that the part was on backorder. The manufacturer was contacted and offered to assist with the cost of the repair. The failure mileage was approximately 63,000.
On July 28th, my touch screen (head unit) in my Subaru Outback suddenly delaminated overnight. From that point foward, all systems connected to the head unit have been either unusable or intermittent--often dangerously so. My backup camera and blind spot indicators are randomly unusable; the GPS system turns itself on and off in use (and half the time,  screen itself cycles through "ghost touches" and is unable to be directed in any way); my car calls random people through the Bluetooth system while driving, which is a major distraction, and Starlink is unusable.  Internet searching has revealed a proposed class action lawsuit against Subaru for the known issues with their head units; the 2018 models were recalled, but as mine is a 2019, I have been told I'm ineligible for support with repairs and would need to pay 3k out of pocket. I can't sell the car with the level of defects it currently has, and driving the vehicle is at best irritating and at worst, dangerous (depending on how the head unit behaves that day). I purchased this car because I wanted to have a backup camera, blind spot indicators, access to GPS support, and more.
There is a parasitic battery drain happening from somewhere in my Subaru Outback. I purchased a battery approximately 6 months ago because my previous one died. Today this one died. Nothing such as leaving lights on or anything else on my part precipitated this. It has not been inspected yet by the dealer.  This seems to be a common thing based on research and needs to be a recall.
Replaced battery 3 months ago due to battery dying repeatedly after vehicle would sit for a short amount of time. Old battery was less than 2 years old. Problem has persisted even with the new battery. This issue risks leaving me stranded anywhere I park the car, including in the middle of the highway if the car were to die there. Looking online this appears to be a common issue with this model and other owners have reported a parasitic drain from the circuit containing the Starlink/DCM module (I have not confirmed this myself).
The windshield in my 2019 Subaru Outback has been replaced 4 times due to cracks, that have reached at least 50% horozontally across the windshield. The most recent replacement (all have been OEM) lasted 3 weeks before spontaneously cracking. The local dealership has analyzed the windshield and found no evidence of an impact, they have confirmed the severity of all the windshields cracks as they have replaced all 4 windshields.
In November 2022, I reported my radio unit was faulty due to a peeling covering for the radio. The resulting problems includes: flashing screen, continual beeping, self-navigating menu changes, making phone calls, sending messages, etc. I was told in early Nov it would 10 days before a radio would be available.   In early December I called the dealership to inquire of the progress, now overdue. I was told it would be 10 days again and the representative told me he was going to re-roder it.  In early January 2023 the radio began to flash, beep, and self-navigate menus including factory resetting itself while in operation. The covering at this point was peeling more. Explaining that it was no inoperable and was being covered with paper to avoid distraction while driving though the beeping was still happening. I called the dealership to inquire and was told no radio replacement was available and to call Subaru direct with my issues.  I called Subaru directly and was told a radio replacement would be available in 10 days and to call back if I didn't hear from them. I called back with no response. I called several more times with no response.  In early February 2023, I called an opened another case but was re-routed to the original case and was told radios were being replaced for orders in late October/early November and mine would likely be available soon and to call back in a few days if I did not hear back. I called several times without a response.   The radio is flashing, beeping, self-navigating menus, turning on, turning off, turning on the radio, changing stations and volume while in motion making driving unsafe.
Feel very uncomfortable during driving, steering wheel moving left or right
The windshield cracked without any impact, vehicle was sitting in the garage and when I came back to it there was a large 8-10 in crack across the driver side. My visibility is impacted and potentially my safety should the strength of the windshield be compromised. Additionally, the safety systems built into the vehicle may be impacted by the crack. The dealership is refusing to complete service to replace the windshield. Vehicle has not been inspected by anyone else yet. No warning lamps, messages, or signs appeared before the windshield cracked.
The vehicle has developed an exhaust leak which allows exhaust to enter the cabin of the vehicle especially at lower speeds and when stopped. There is a crack which develops in the exhaust manifold which causes this issue. This is a known problem and there have been recalls in the past with this exact same issue for Subarus with the same engines. This poses a safety issue given the exposure to Carbon Monoxide.
The contact owns a 2019 Subaru Outback. The contact stated the low lever oil warning light illuminated on the instrument panel. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic, and he stated that the oil was low in the engine and more oil was added to the engine. The contact stated that in less than 5,000 miles the vehicle had burned all the oil in the engine. The vehicle was taken to the dealer but was not able to get a diagnosis on the vehicle. The manufacturer was not contacted. The failure mileage was 30,578.
Windshield development a crack about 12 inches long without any known impact. It just popped and cracked by itself. Conditions were normal, no extreme heat or cold.
The windshield of my Subaru Outback just cracked spontaneously and it needed to be replaced. Subaru of America is not paying for the replacement even if it is not my fault that it cracked. They said it is out of warranty but there is an ongoing class action suit against them about this
The contact owns a 2019 Subaru Outback. The contact stated that his wife had parked the vehicle, and when she returned observed that the windshield had cracked in the middle of the windshield starting under the rearview mirror. The contact's wife drove the vehicle to a dealer where it was diagnosed that an impact had cracked the windshield. The contact said his wife observed that the crack had spread when she arrived at the dealer. The vehicle had not been repaired. The manufacturer had not been informed of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 55,000.
Came out of Home Depot on Sunday February 13, 2022 to find large crack in our 2019 Subaru Outback windshield on drivers side for no reason. This spontaneous cracking happened on this same vehicle on Feb.20, 2021 on the previous windshield but on the passengers side and I reported it to NHTSA ID # 11397305. Had it replaced last year and now same issue with spontaneous cracking. Clearly these Subaru OEM windshields are defective and they are very expensive not to mention extra cost of eyesight recalibration on them. I am attaching photos but hard to get whole crack accurately as it originates from the very edge of the windshield and radiates across.
The contact owns a 2019 Subaru Outback. The contact stated while the vehicle was stationary at a traffic light, a crack developed at the center of the front windshield. The contact took the vehicle to the local dealer, where it was diagnosed with needing the front windshield to be replaced. The vehicle was repaired but on 12/24/2021, he had experienced the failure for a second time. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer had not been informed of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 25,000.
I have had 3 windshields crack for no apparent reason in the 2.5 years that I have had the vehicle. All had to be replaced. Average costs to replace was $950. All started with the smallest cracks only to spider across the windshield within minutes.
2019 Outback with 6500 miles on it. Battery just died. Sounds like the battery drain issue mentioned in ongoing lawsuit.
Have had 2 batteries fail in 2 1/2 years. New battery installed and my electrical system is failing. Can't lock my car unless fob is in an RFID bag, has not started several times, and has refued to open several times for about a minute. Will be taking car back to dealer to see if they can fix the problem.
We have had to replace 2 windshields on our vehicle and 1 on a loaner while ours was in shop for window replacement. Also while our car was in shop having 2nd windshield replaced,  they had to delay giving us our  car back stating the windshield shattered while being installed. That is 4 windshields in 30,000 miles. The smallest ding in these windshields cause an immediate crack from side to side obscuring visibility making them dangerous to drive.  On these cracks you can see the windshields are incredibly thin.  There is clearly an issue with how these are made and immediate safety hazard. I also believed the cost of these replacements should be made clear to consumers at purchase due to the extremely high cost associated with replacement.
1. System failed. We purchased this car on 6/2/20, with a mileage of 6,174 miles. We are retired and don't drive much; for shorter distances we mostly rode our bicycles. In our recent  living environment we can park cars outside in spaces, and in a large underground parking garage. While we did not drive much, I still needed to work on bicycles using tools stored in the rear trunk compartment, with the trunk lid in open position. What I did not know was that even the mere open car trunk was run electrically, though the large electronic dashboard gave a clue of a rather massive reliance on functions run electronically; after a mere 2-3 days of not driving we were made rudely aware that keeping the trunk lid open for any amount of time was a recipe for not being able to use the car when most needed; I should add here that the many Subaru drivers in our complex did not seem to have that problem as they are all  "professional" drivers.  We called our designated towing service and had to wait for over 3 hours for a rep to show up. Not having bought a car in years we were amazed how quickly the tow driver pulled out an electronic gadget and started the car. It immediately bought one like that, an electronic jump starter.   SAFETY. Had my wife had to find transportation to an urgent appointment it would have become a safety problem.  PROBLEM CONFIRMATION. No, it has not, except by me, as any greater than fleeting use of electricity in this car is a recipe for disaster. COMPONENT INSPECTED. Yes. After 2 more battery outages I took the car to the dealer and  explained the problem (which had little impact on the employee). I had the battery checked,   it was fine and working as designed. On 9/25/21, after another  battery outage I took the car to the dealer again; again everything was operating as designed. SYMPTOMS OF THE PROBLEM. No. ASSESSMENT.  I concluded I needed to keep the car RUNNING when using any function more than 5 minutes.  This car is  a computer on wheels.
BATTERY DRAIN.  PURCHASED 2019 SUBARU OUTBACK IN NOVEMBER 2018. IN OCTOBER 2020 (23 MONTHS) IT FAILED TO START AFTER STAYING OVERNIGHT AT REST STOP IN MIDDLE OF LONG DRIVE. CHECKED BY DEALER AFTER TRIP --"BATTERY OK. NO PROBLEMS." OVER NEXT 5 MONTHS OF INFREQUENT SHORT TRIPS, OUTBACK FAILED TO START MULTIPLE TIMES. MEASURED CURRENT DRAIN WHEN VEHICLE OFF WAS FOUND TO BE WITHIN SUBARU ALLOWABLE (<70 MILLIAMPS) BUT ONLY AFTER 15-20 MINUTES AFTER EVERYTHING HAD BEEN TURNED OFF. CURRENT DRAIN DURING THE 15-20 MINUTES WAS AS HIGH AS 2 AMPS. ANY ACTIVITY (E.G., OPENING A DOOR, SETTING ALARM) RE-INITIATED THE 15-20 MINUTES OF HIGH CURRENT DRAIN. PHONED DEALER: ONLY SOLUTION (WITHIN WARRANTY PERIOD) WAS REPLACEMENT WITH SAME OEM BATTERY. DECIDED TO REPLACE WITH MORE ROBUST, NON-SUBARU BATTERY, SINCE MY EXPERIENCE AND REPORTS OF OTHERS INDICATED OEM BATTERY WOULD BE INSUFFICIENT TO HANDLE AMOUNT OF DRAIN. PURCHASED OPTIMA RED25 BATTERY FROM AUTO PARTS STORE ON 6 APRIL 2021 FOR $199.99. I BELIEVE THAT SUBARU NEEDS TO CORRECT THE ISSUE OF CURRENT DRAIN (PREFERABLY) AND/OR EQUIP THE OUTBACK WITH AN ADEQUATE BATTERY WITH MORE RESERVE POWER. SINCE MY ORIGINAL BATTERY FAILED UNDER WARRANTY, I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE REIMBURSED FOR MY EXPENSE OF $199.99.
VEHICLE PURCHASED Q2 2020. BATTERY HAS COMPLETELY DISCHARGED TWICE DESPITE NOTHING BEING LEFT ON AND VEHICLE IN CONSTANT USE. BATTERY JUMP STARTER UNABLE TO DETECT ANY VOLTAGE AND COULD NOT JUMP BATTERY.
DEAD BATTERY, CAR WOULD NOT START, NO REASON FOR DEAD BATTERY.  POSSIBLE OVERCHARGING DUE TO ELECTRICAL ISSUES
BATTERY TOTALLY DEAD UPON ENTERING AND ATTEMPTING TO START. WINDSCREEN COMMENCED TO CRACK WHILE TRAVELING.
THIS IS MY SECOND WINDSHIELD THAT WAS REPLACED ON 12/08/2020 I WALKED OUT TO MY CAR WHICH HAD BEEN PARKED IN THE DRIVE WAY SINCE 12/30/2020 AND NOTICED THE WINDSHIELD WAS CRACKED FROM THE BOTTOM PASSENGER SIDE UNDER THE BLACK WINDOW TRIM I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID TO CALL MY INSURANCE. THERE IS NO CHIP NO NOTHING JUST THE CRACK LEADING FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE MIDDLE OF THE WINDOW NOW
ON THE MORNING OF DECEMBER 9TH, 2020 I WAS DRIVING TO WORK ON THE FREEWAY AND WAS ON AN INTERCHANGE FROM ONE FREEWAY TO ANOTHER WHEN I SUDDENLY HEARD A 'CRACK'. AS I ARRIVED TO WORK A FEW MINUTES LATER I NOTICED THAT MY WINDSHIELD NOW HAD A LARGE CRACK IN IT. I LOOKED FOR A POINT OF IMPACT THINKING A PROJECTILE MIGHT HAVE HIT IT BUT I DID NOT FIND ONE. AT THAT POINT I REMEMBERED THAT I WAS THE ONLY ONE ON THE INTERCHANGE AT THE TIME AND THAT THERE WAS NO CAR IN FRONT OF ME TO SEND ANY PROJECTILES FLYING BACK. I BELIEVE THIS IS DUE TO A FAULTY WINDSHIELD AS THERE WAS NO OTHER CAUSE FOR THE CRACK.      ADDITIONALLY, ENGINE FEELS LIKE IT SPUTTERS OR AS IF TRANSMISSION DOES NOT CHANGE GEARS CAUSING A DELAY IN PICK UP AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS LACK OF ACCELERATION.
UNINTENDED ACCELERATION EVENT WHEN APPLYING THE BRAKE AT SLOW SPEED, PULLING INTO A PARKING SPOT. BRAKING FORCE WAS UNABLE TO OVER COME THE ACCELERATION. FORTUNATELY NO INJURIES OR DAMAGE. A SCARY SITUATION, CONFIDENCE LOST IN THE VEHICLE.SUBARU NORTH AMERICA CLAIMS "THE VEHICLE IS SAFE AND OPERATING AS DESIGNED."
HAVE 10,000 MILES ON MY 2019 SUBARU AND HAVE BEEN STRANDED TWICE BECAUSE OF BATTERIE.   SUBARU HAVE CHANGED TWO BATTERIES SO FAR
THE WINDSHIELD RANDOMLY CRACKED AFTER SPRAYING THE WINDSHIELD WASHER FLUID ON IT. THE CRACK CONTINUED TO GROW BIGGER THROUGHOUT A COUPLE DAYS AND REACHED A LENGTH OVER 1 FOOT BY THE SECOND DAY. THE VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY WHEN IT WAS SPRAYED WITH THE WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID.
MY OUTBACK HAD FUEL PUMP FAILURE AND STALLED ON HIGHWAY RAMP ON JULY 5, 2020 AFTER SUBARU DEALERSHIP REPLACED FUEL PUMP ON JULY 1, 2020 PER SAFETY RECALL WRD-20.    ON JULY 1, 2020, I HAD MY 18,000 MILES SERVICE AND SAFETY RECALL WRD-20 (FUEL-PUMP)  DONE AT SUBARU DEALERSHIP. PICKED UP THE CAR AND DROVE IT HOME. ON JULY 5, I DROVE FROM PLEASANT HILL TO SAN FRANCISCO AND THE CAR STALLED ON HIGHWAY 101  AT OFF RAMP. I CANNOT RESTART THE CAR AND THERE WAS HEAVY SMELL OF GASOLINE COMING INSIDE THE CAR. I CANNOT PUSH IT TO THE SIDE SINCE THE DRIVING WHEEL IS VERY HARD TO MOVE AND THE CAR STALLED IN THE MIDDLE LANE OF THREE LANES HIGHWAY RAMP.  I HAD TO WAIT FOR TOW TRUCK TO COME TO GET OFF THE HIGHWAY AND IT WAS TOWED BACK TO MY HOME SINCE THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE SHOP IS CLOSED ON SUNDAY. AFTER THE TOW TRUCK DROPPED OFF MY CAR, I WAS TRYING TO START THE CAR AND FOUND OUT GASOLINE IS LEAKING/POURING FROM BOTTOM OF MY CAR AND STILL CANNOT START. I HAVE ATTACHED TWO PICTURES TO SHOW THE GASOLINE LEAKING/POURING CONDITION. I WENT ONLINE AND FOUND I AM NOT THE ONLY CASE THAT FUEL PUMP FAILED AGAIN AFTER RECALL WRD-20 FUEL PUMP REPLACEMENT. THIS IS NOT SAFE FOR DRIVERS.
SUBARU WINDSHIELD EASILY CRACKS.  WITHIN A FEW WEEKS OF PURCHASING THE VEHICLE, A CRACK FORMED BEGINNING AT THE TOP OF THE WINDSHIELD NEAR THE REARVIEW MIRROR AND SPREAD DOWN.  SINCE REPLACING THE WINDSHIELD WITH AN OEM PART, 3 MORE LARGE CRACKS HAVE FORMED.  WHILE SOME HAVE BEGUN FROM A SMALL ROCK CHIP, THEY ORIGINATE FROM THE EDGE OF THE GLASS AND SPREAD INWARD.  THE GLASS APPEARS WEAK AS EVEN THE SMALLEST CHIP WILL CAUSE A LARGE CRACK.  THE CAR IS NOT DRIVEN ANY DIFFERENTLY FROM CURRENT AND PREVIOUS VEHICLES OWNED YET THE AMOUNT OF CHIPS AND CRACKS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED IN THE WINDSHIELD IN THE LESS THAN ONE YEAR OF OWNING THE VEHICLE EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT OF CHIPS AND CRACKS WE'VE HAD IN THE LIFETIME OF OUR OTHER VEHICLES.  *TR
THE WINDSHIELD SPONTANEOUSLY CRACKED FROM THE MID-CENTER OF THE WINDSHIELD WHILE PARKED. THE CRACK BEGAN IN OCTOBER, 2019, LESS THAN A YEAR AFTER PURCHASE. THERE WAS NO IMPACT CAUSING DAMAGE AND THE CRACK BEGAN WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED.  *TR
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2019 SUBARU OUTBACK. THE CONTACT STATED THAT AT 40 MPH OR ABOVE, THE VEHICLE WAS DIFFICULT TO STEER DUE TO THE LOSS OF POWER STEERING ASSIST. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE VEERED INDEPENDENTLY FROM LANE TO LANE WHICH MADE THE VEHICLE UNSAFE TO DRIVE. THE CONTACT REACHED OUT TO CAPITOL SUBARU LOCATED AT (235 CHERRY AVE NE, SALEM, OR 97301, 503-576-3300) BY EMAIL BUT WAS YET TO RECEIVE A RESPONSE IN RETURN. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS INFORMED OF THE FAILURE BUT STATED THAT DUE TO THE CURRENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THEY WERE UNABLE TO VERIFY A DATE OR TIME WHEN THE VEHICLE WOULD BE REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 100.  *BF*JB
I HAD BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE DRIVER SIDE WINDSHIELD WIPER THAT WHEN RAINING THERE WAS A SECTION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WIPER THAT DIDN'T TOUCH THE GLASS TO CLEAR THE WATER.  AFTER GETTING TIRED OF THIS, NEW WIPERS WERE PUT ON HOPING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  NO DIFFERENCE WAS SEEN IN THE REMOVAL OF THE WATER WHEN RAINING.  IT SEEMS THAT THE GLASS WAS CONCAVED IN CERTAIN SPOTS CAUSING THE WATER TO POOL UNDER THE BLADE AND NOT BE REMOVED.    A FEW WEEKS LATER, OUT OF KNOW WHERE, A SLIGHT MARK WAS NOTICED ON THE GLASS UNDER THE PASSENGER SIDE WINDSHIELD WIPER. THIS VEHICLE HAS HEATED STRIPS UNDER THE BLADES TO DEFROST ICE.  AFTER TOUCHING IT, IT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE CHIPPED. THE NEXT MORNING WHEN I WENT OUT TO THE CAR, THERE WAS A VERTICAL CRACK IN THE GLASS GOING UP AND GREW VERY QUICKLY BEFORE I COULD GET TO A SUBARU DEALER. IT THEN TURNED DIRECTION HEADING TOWARDS THE DRIVER SIDE.
I WAS DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY WHEN A CHIP SUDDENLY APPEARED ON THE WINDSHIELD ON THE LEFT SIDE ON THE WINDSHIELD.  I THOUGHT THIS WAS STRANGE CONSIDERING I WAS IN THE LEFT LANE OF THE HIGHWAY WITH A LARGE MEDIAN AND NO TRUCKS NEAR ME.  OVER THE NEXT HOUR THE CHIP TURNED INTO A 6 INCH PLUS CRACK.  I HAVE SINCE HAD THE WINDSHIELD REPLACED UNDER MY CAR INSURANCE POLICY.
I GOT INTO MY CAR THAT WAS PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY AND NOTICED A LARGE CRACK IN MY WINDSHIELD ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE. IT WAS NOT THERE THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THERE WAS NO IMPACT TO MY WINDSHIELD. SINCE THEN THE CRACK HAS SPREAD ABOUT 1/3 OF THE WAY ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD. AGAIN, SPONTANEOUSLY WITH NO IMPACT.
WINDSHIELD CRACKED FOR NO APPARENT REASON. WHEN I PARKED THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF MY RESIDENCE, THE WINDSHIELD WAS FINE. WHEN I CAME BACK AFTER PARKING THE VEHICLE OVERNIGHT, THE WINDSHIELD WAS CRACKED.
THE VEHICLE HAS HAD WINDSHIELD CRACKS APPEAR THREE TIMES IN THE SIX MONTHS WE HAVE OWNED IT (PURCHASED NEW).  BOTH THE DEALER AND THE GLASS REPAIR SHOP INDICATE THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR THIS MODEL.  IN THE FIRST TWO INSTANCES, THERE WAS A MINOR IMPACT WITH A SMALL PEBBLE OR BIT OF SAND AT CITY SPEEDS (LESS THAN 40 MPH) AND IN THE MOST RECENT INCIDENT, THE CRACK APPEARED SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT OBVIOUS IMPACT WHILE DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE AT 70 MPH.  NONE OF THE IMPACTS WERE SUFFICIENT, IN MY ESTIMATION, TO CAUSE DAMAGE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO REQUIRE REPLACEMENT OF THE WINDSHIELD, BUT, IN ALL CASES, THE CRACK SPREAD ACROSS THE ENTIRE WINDSHIELD WITHIN MOMENTS.  BASED ON OTHER REPORTS ON THE INTERNET, IT WOULD APPEAR THE WINDSHIELD ON THESE VEHICLES IS POORLY DESIGNED AND/OR MANUFACTURED, CREATING A SAFETY ISSUE.
THE WINDSHIELD DEVELOPED A LARGE CRACK STARTING FROM THE TOP-CENTER EDGE WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE OR SIGNS OF IMPACT.  THE CRACK WAS NOT THERE IN THE EVENING AND WAS OVER 6" LONG IN THE MORNING (VEHICLE PARKED IN FULLY ENCLOSED GARAGE OVERNIGHT).
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2019 SUBARU OUTBACK. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THERE WAS A SMALL CRACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD. THE CRACK EXPANDED IN HOT WEATHER. THE CONTACT CALLED LANCASTER COUNTY MOTORS SUBARU (1705 MANHEIM PIKE, LANCASTER, PA 717-569-4514), BUT WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE FAILURE WAS REPORTED TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY, BUT NO FURTHER ASSISTANCE WAS PROVIDED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 11,000. *TT*JB
PURCHASED NEW 2019 SUBARU OUTBACK.  WHEN PARKED IN THE GARAGE OVERNIGHT AFTER JUST A COUPLE WEEKS A STRESS CRACK BEGAN TO FORM FROM THE TOP OF THE WINDSHIELD GOING DOWN.  THE NEXT DAY IT WAS OUTSIDE ON A HOT DAY AND THE CRACK BEGAN TO GET WORSE.  NO IMPACT ON WINDSHIELD  FROM ROCK OR ANYTHING ELSE.  MAY BE CAUSED FROM HEAT?  VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY IN BOTH CASES.
2019 SUBARU OUTBACK PURCHASED 2/20/19; TOOK POSSESSION 2/22/19. ON 4/14/19 TWO VERY LARGE (18-24IN)CRACKS, RAPIDLY SPREADING APPEARED AS I STARTED UP MY VEHICLE. ONE CRACK STARTED ABOUT 2 IN ABOVE THE LOWER CORNER ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE. APPROXIMATELY 2 WEEKS BEFORE THIS CRACK APPEARED, A VERY SMALL PIECE OF GRAVEL STRUCK THE WINDSHIELD IN THIS AREA BUT NO DAMAGE/CRACKS/HOLES WERE VISIBLE ON CLOSE INSPECTION FOLLOWING THIS. THE SECOND CRACK ORIGINATED APPROX. MIDWAY BELOW THE WIPER APPARATUS ON THE DRIVERS SIDE. THERE HAD BEEN NO ROCKS HITTING IN THIS AREA PREVIOUSLY OR OTHER DAMAGE. AGAIN, BOTH CRACKS STARTED AFTER THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN IMMOBILE OVERNIGHT IN MY GARAGE; THE TEMPERATURE THAT MORNING WAS IN THE HIGH 40S (48F) AND IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED ON STARTING THE VEHICLE AND SPREAD WITHIN SECONDS TO 18-24 INCHES ARCHING ACROSS THE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDSHIELD. SINCE, THE CRACKS HAVE CONTINUED TO SPREAD APPROX 1-3 INCHES PER DAY. IN CONTACTING THE DEALERSHIP, THEY DENY ANY ISSUES WITH SUBARU OUTBACK WINDSHIELDS. THIS IS UNLIKE ANY WINDSHIELD CRACKING EXPERIENCE I HAVE HAD AND DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE DUE TO ROCK DAMAGE, OTHER EXTERNAL DAMAGE.
PURCHASED A BRAND NEW 2019 SUBARU OUTBACK 3.6R LIMITED WITH EYESIGHT. WITH LESS THAN 23 MILES ON IT, THE WINDSHIELD SPONTANEOUSLY CRACKED JUST SITTING IN THE GARAGE. RESEARCHING THE WEB SHOWS THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH SUBARU OUTBACK.
Vehicle had 45,000 miles on it when right rear wheel bearing failed. It was covered under 5 year/60,000 mile warranty and was repaired today by a certified Subaru dealer and I no longer have the bad part for inspection. Safety risks would be anything that occurs from a bad wheel bearing like wobble, seizing, overheating, and more damage to other drivetrain components. You could hear the wheel bearing noise at 20 mph constant while driving, only getting louder with increased speed. No warning lights were present on the dash. I feel like at 45,000 miles, a wheel bearing should not be failing.
The drivers seat is loose, rocking back and forth significantly to the point it very noticeable while driving. The dealer states that this is due to the bottom seat frame being worn out. There are only 41,000 miles on the car, about 37,000 when I first noticed the information. This should not fail so early the car’s life. The dealer is replacing the bottom seat frame at a cost of $1310.
As my husband & I were traveling to Augusta, GA on Memorial Day weekend with our niece, we approached the [XXX] outside Chattanooga, Tennessee in heavy traffic and heavy rain on Saturday [XXX] 2024 at approximately [XXX] When we stopped for a small accident ahead of us, the “auto stop-start engine” feature stopped the car engine as normal. However, almost instantly, all of the electronics in the car appeared to fail and the car would not restart. The dashboard indicated that Eyesight and RAB were disabled and to "check the owner's manual." Normal traffic quickly resumed around us, but we were stranded in the #2 lane with several close calls of a rear-end collision--not to mention the cars at risk swerving to avoid us. My husband is a retired firefighter & our niece is a nurse in Los Angeles. Frankly, we were terrified! We were stranded on the interstate in the #2 lane for about 20 minutes before being pushed into the "gore zone" between [XXX] & [XXX] by a TDOT truck. We spent about 40 minutes in the gore zone where we were nearly hit twice by cars driving across the zone. We were finally towed to Crown Subaru in Chattanooga, TN and arrived there about 11:40 a.m. The general manager of the dealership, Keith Aviles, told us there was a sudden, massive failure of a battery cell controlling the electronics of the car, and the battery was replaced. We never had any indication or evidence prior to this incident that there were issues with the battery. Also, we have never received a notice from Subaru about battery problems. However, we are now aware that Subaru settled a class action lawsuit to avoid a recall of these batteries. I have notified six friends who own Subarus. Three have had issues with their batteries, but were also unaware of the class action lawsuit. This is absolutely shocking for a vehicle manufacturer that touts safety to sell vehicles.

I sent a complaint yesterday, I would like to add this to the complaint [XXX]  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
I was driving and car accelerated without warning. Hit partially open garage door, only stopped after hitting and damaging back wall of garage. Significant damage to car, items in the garage and garage wall. There was no warning whatsoever. As of yet the car has not been assessed as to the cause of the malfunction.
Over the course of the nearly three years I have owned my vehicle, the windshield has either spontaneously cracked or cracked from a very very small chip three times. Two of these occurred while I was driving, with no debris impact with the vehicle windshield.  There have been several suits filed against Subaru for similar cases, including for the 2020 Outback model. This has been three times in about two and a half years, quadruple the amount for my previous vehicle.  Not only is this a vision impairment while driving and a financial burden to fix, I also worry about more catastrophic failure should anything significant impact the windshield while driving.  I have had the glass repaired twice, and both times the repair technicians could not understand how such a significant crack had occurred.
On Friday February 10, 2023 I came out of work and saw a 12 inch crack in my front windshield. When I left for work there wasn’t any crack.  There is a very small pit in the windshield how or when it happened I do not know. February 11, 2023 the crack is now about 20 inches. I can’t believe how fast it is cracking.
On Saturday 12/10/2022 at approximately 5PM, I was driving my 2020 Subaru Outback on the left lane of a highway in South Miami at a speed of 65+ miles per hour when the vehicle lost all power.  The vehicle’s Eye Sight" system alerted me to "Keep your eyes on the road”, then all of the instrumentation on the dashboard lit up.  I was able to maneuver my vehicle through traffic to the relative safety of the right shoulder of the highway.  I tried to restart the engine and that was a futile effort.  The electrical failure in the vehicle also impacted the hazard lights and now my car was engulfed in darkness on the highway, making a bad situation even worse.  I contacted Subaru Starlink and they promised a tow truck within in an hour but later revised the estimate to 11PM.  Meanwhile there are 4 women occupants in my vehicle  and all are in our 60's.  Subaru could not and would not provide us safe transportation off the highway at that time of night due to "liability issues".  In the end, I was able to secure my own tow truck and transported my car to a Subaru dealership and transported myself and my passengers to safety.   The Subaru dealer informed me that my experience is a known issue with Subaru and that the root cause is a defective valve.  This valve is on back order and its availability is impacted by supply chain issues.  My car remains at the dealership and I have been provided with a loaner vehicle in the interim.  There is no ETA on the repair or when I will have my car back.
My outback has 22500 miles on it.  The wind shield had not visible cracks or chips.  I got to work on 10/06 and when I cam back to my car there was a large 2-3 foot crack starting in the black area around the glass. the crack there was large enough to fit a piece of paper into it.  It appears to have just cracked and spread apart from strain or stress on the glass.  The crack runs directly across my view as the driver.  The windshield had always been loud and you could hear wind moving around it.
On multiple occasions, the center console has gone black and I have no control over any of the car's functions (e.g. climate control, navigation, radio, ability to turn on/off safety features, etc). This had been happening for several weeks before the more concerning incident. The auto-stop/start at a red light failed to work. The car shut off, but wouldn't restart for several seconds. Eventually it restarted and I was able to get it home  Because I was afraid to drive it, the car sat in my driveway for aprox. 2 weeks before I could take it to the dealership. By then, the battery was completely dead and I had to get a jump start from AAA. I drove the car straight to the dealership. For at least 45 minutes after that jump, the center console wouldn't come back on. Because I had no means to turn off the auto start/stop feature, I had to put my car into park at every red light to avoid it shutting off. I don't know when it actually came back on, as that happened at some point after I dropped off my car at the dealership for service.  Although the dealer did see that the center console wasn't working, they couldn't tell me why it happened. In addition, they were not able to reproduce the problem with the auto start not working. They indicated the battery checked out fine. (This is also the 2nd battery I've had in this car as the first died for unknown reasons - they indicated they thought a rear light was on, but that light is never turned on)  Because almost everything happens via that center console, that is a major failure if that just randomly goes out. Failure of the auto start/stop could strand me in traffic.   My car is available for inspection.

Starlink Head System/software malfunctions while driving.  This shuts down all safety systems, back up camera, radio.  Heating system cannot be controlled while shut down.  System restarts automatically after a few minutes but settings, etc may need to be restored.  This creates a distraction that could lead to a collision or loss of vehicle control.  Investigation reveals that many have this problem with the 11.6" Starlink display.  A recall should be initiated for repair/replacement of problem components.  Note that two software updates have been completed at the dealer to correct this problem to no avail.
The contact owns a 2020 Subaru Outback. The contact received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 21V955000 (Power Train) however, the part to do the recall repair was unavailable. The local dealer was contacted and confirmed that the part was not available. The contact stated that the manufacturer had exceeded a reasonable amount of time for the recall repair. The manufacturer was made aware of the issue. The contact had not experienced a failure. VIN tool confirms parts not available.
My 2020 Subaru Outback has had starting issues since shortly after I purchased the car on 1/31/2020. If I do not drive the car for more than two or three days the car will not start without a jump. On one occasion the battery was completely drained so that the fob key would not even unlock the car. Not long after I purchased the car I spoke to a mechanic at the Subaru dealership regarding the battery drain issue. He offered me no solutions except to say that there are many computers in the Subaru Outback and together they draw a lot of current. I do not know if I received a defective battery or if there is some electrical defect causing excessive battery drain when the car is off.
In the last 11 months, we have had to replace the front windshield four times due to significant cracks that occurred after a rock hit the windshield (3 times) and one time following a hailstone hit.  The cracks do  not show up immediately, but about two hours after the incident.  The "Eyesight" safety features don't work when this happens.  Our driving is in town or on a freeway.  We DO NOT do off-road driving or driving on gravel/dirt roads.  The windshields have been replaced with Subaru factory windshields and re-calibrated each time.  The auto glass repair shop we use believes this cracking problem is a design issue as the glass is steeply angled and the thickness of the glass is thinner.  This is our fourth Subaru and we have never had this issue.  In the past, a rock hit would just bounce off the windshield or leave a small "star burst" nick that could be filled.   I emailed Subaru of America and asked them what, if anything, they were doing to address this issue. I have not received a response to my email, sent over a week ago.
I have a 2020 Subaru outback that I purchased brand new one and a half years ago. It has 31,472 miles on it on December 28, 2021 and then again on January 31, 2021 my car would not start on the battery had to be replaced.
My car stalled at a stop light when I attempted to go when the light turned green.  The car was in auto shut off mode so the engine was not running at the time.  When I took my foot off the brake to go, the car didn’t restart and started shaking and all the lights on the dash came on.  There was also a piercing warning sound and the infotainment screen showed that the “eyesight “ and all other driver assistance program were off but my audiobook continued to play.  I tried restarting the car but it would not restart. I put the car in park and tried to get it to turn off but it wouldn’t.  Since I was at a light and cars were behind me, I put on my hazards and waited a few minutes and got the car to restart and to get that noise to stop, sounded like a siren.  My fuel warning had just come on but it indicated that I had 50 miles so not sure if it has anything to do with it?
11/10/21 first incident: vehicle stalled in middle of dangerous busy road intersection:  would not start.  After about 15-20 min, it restarted.  Drove to Dealer who reported: "battery low, taking too many short trips running down the battery.  Many codes found. all referring to low battery".    11/16/21 second incident in remote beach parking lot.  After a 30-45 min walk, vehicle would not start.  solenoids clicked, engine turned over a few times, but would not start.  15-20 min later,  was able to start.  Drove to dealer and left vehicle.  Tech wondered if problem was maybe not the battery, possible loose wire, but none found immediately. Left car with them.  11/17/21:  Dealer called: "bad fuel pump overheating and stopping. once cooled down would run again."  Ordered a new part will be here in 2 days.  I am not sure of their explanation since the car had a long time in the cold for fuel pump to cool down.  If they are right, then the fuel pump must be defective from manufacturer.
While driving down interstate, windshield must have made contact with rock or other foreign object at mid/low left side of glass. I say must have because object too small to create any noticeable sound at impact. Within minutes, large linear crack appeared extending slightly farther than midline.   This is the 2nd incident of this type creating damage to the windshield of this vehicle. Another previous incident occurred with front passenger window. In all 3 incidents, damage far exceeds what would be expected given size of initial impact area.
Windshield cracked causing a problem with "Front Eyesight Collision" Right side does not see Large Vehicles in Right Lane.  Left side works fine.
While driving the car the car's computer/radio/navigation system will randomly shut down.  This has been occurring since approx 6500 miles.  When this occurs all of the safety systems/HVAC/Rear Camera/Radio/Navigation systems all will fail with the associated warning lights.  The car now has approx 9000 miles, this appears to be random occurrences about every 200-250 miles.  Dealer states that they are aware of the problem and was told to contact back late June/early July that SOA was going to release a software fix.  Well time has passed and nothing has occurred.  When driving this car and the failure occurs all of the safety systems are totally inoperable thus the computerized safety systems are not functional.  So, far I have been able to maintain full control of the car.  The time for the systems to comeback online is highly variable and sometimes I have to stop, and turn the car off for approximately 10 minutes to have the systems return to being functional.  For example, the automated cruise control if in operation will fail to operate, the backup camera will be inoperable, the side space warning will fail, lane assist will fail, and so on for all of the safety systems that this particular car has will all fail.  Fortunately,  I have been able to safely find a safe place to stop, but what happens when this failure occurs and there is not a place to stop/pull over to rest the car/computer.  I can't be the only owner/driver that is having this problem(s) they are all interrelated when the master computer shuts down all of the other systems then follow.  It is only a matter of time that a potential crash with associated injury and or loss of life can potentially occur.  Dealer is unable to replicate and therefore unable to repair/replace parts.  Once this failure can be rectified/corrected this is a wonderful car.  At this point, I am unable to determine the cause nor am I able to prevent these failures.
Today, 7/11/2021 my 3rd OEM Subaru windshield cracked spontaneously, while driving.  All windshields were replaced at Beardmore Subaru, in Belleville, NE using Subaru replacement windshields.  In all instances the windshield has cracked spontaneously without impact on either the passenger side or  at the bottom of the windshield, near the middle. The cracks continue to propagate quickly while driving or when parked overnight, until the crack terminates on the side opposite the crack.  This spontaneous cracking, is a safety hazard in that it not only compromises the integrity of the glass, but also can affect the Subaru EyeSight safety vision system, by impairing camera view thru the windshield if a crack propagates through the cameras field of view.  This new instance means that in less than 10,000 miles I have had 4 windshields in this car.  I have never had this occur on any vehicle I have owned previously, nor to our 2017 Outback.  This appears to be a defect in Subaru OEM glass or the specifications Subaru has engineered for the 2020 and up Outback global platform.
In the last month, twice within 30 seconds of starting the car, the head unit has done a complete reboot, which meant that I had no rear-view camera as I was backing out of a parking space. Since the car was already in motion, it was very distracting as it took about a minute for the unit to reboot. This seems to indicate that there is an electrical problem with the car as many others have noted. Many of the car's controls (such as climate control) are soft buttons displayed on the head unit and cannot be adjusted otherwise. Therefore, it is essential that this unit operate properly and dependably.
On one of my first times driving my new car to work on my morning commute I was traveling at a normal rate of speed and with a lot of distance from the car in front of me I heard a crack and saw the windshield beginning to show signs of a straight crack. That was December 15, 2020. Now on May 19, 2021 I have a crack from the far right side of the windshield and runs to the initial location, about 70% across my windshield.
I HAVE A 2020 SUBARU OUTBACK. THE WINDSHIELDS KEEP BREAKING. I JUST HAD THE THIRD (3RD) WINDSHIELD INSTALLED IN THIS 2020 VEHICLE AND IT WAS CRACKED BEFORE IT WAS TWO WEEKS OLD. THE LAST WINDSHIELD I HAD WAS SPIDER WEBS OF CRACKS - I DROVE IT LIKE THAT FOR MONTHS WAITING ON SUBARU TO FIX THE GLASS ISSUE. IT IS NOT FIXED. I HAVE DRIVEN CARS IN THIS AREA FOR TWO DECADES AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.  THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE NEW SUBARU WINDSHIELDS. SMALL DEBRIS WILL HIT THE CAR ON HWY/INTERSTATE THAT WOULD NOT USUALLY CRACK GLASS AND IT CRACKS. IT CHIPS VERY EASY AND THEN CRACKS TO A LENGTH THAT IS NOT ABLE TO BE REPAIRED. I THINK SOME OF THE CRACKS JUST APPEAR. BIZARRE. A FAMILY MEMBER HAS 2021 ASCENT AND JUST HAD TO REPLACE HER WINDSHIELD ALSO.
THE WINDSHIELD ON OUR 2020 SUBARU OUTBACK WAS NOT CRACKED WHEN I PARKED IT IN THE GARAGE ONE NIGHT. THE NEXT AFTERNOON WHEN WE GOT IN TO DRIVE TO THE GROCERY STORE, THE WINDSHIELD HAD AN UNEXPECTED CRACK APPROXIMATELY 14 INCHES LONG, ON THE PASSENGER SIDE, ABOUT 1/3 OF THE WAY DOWN FROM THE TOP, GOING HORIZONTALLY ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD. THIS CRACK CAME SEEMINGLY OUT OF NOWHERE. THE VEHICLE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN STATIONARY WHEN THIS OCCURRED. WE HAVE HAD THE CAR FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS. THIS CRACK APPEARED ON SUNDAY AND IS HUGE, WE WILL NEED THE WINDSHIELD REPLACED.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2020 SUBARU OUTBACK. THE CONTACT STATED THAT UPON ENTERING THE VEHICLE, THE CONTACT BECAME AWARE OF A CRACK ON THE UPPER SECTION OF THE WINDSHIELD. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE CRACK WAS NOT CAUSED BY AN IMPACT. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE CRACK OBSTRUCTED HER VISION WHILE DRIVING. NEITHER THE DEALER NOR THE MANUFACTURER WERE NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 5,000.
LAST SUNDAY MORNING I DISCOVERED A CRACKED WINDSHIELD AS I GOT INTO THE CAR. CRACK APPEARED FOR NO APPARENT REASON AND WAS NOT THERE THE DAY BEFORE WHEN CAR WAS LAST DRIVEN. CAR WAS PARKED IN THE GARAGE OVERNIGHT.
CAR WILL NOT START. BATTERY IS DEAD. WE DROVE IT MONDAY AND IT WAS FINE. WE DID NOT USE LIGHTS AND MADE SURE EVERYTHING WAS OFF. TODAY, IT WOULD NOT START. BATTERY WAS DEAD!
I HAD ALMOST THE EXACT SAME EXPERIENCE WITH MY WINDSHIELD AS ANOTHER COMPLAINT I SAW FILED. MY 2020 SUBARU OUTBACK HAD ITS WINDSHIELD CRACKED WHILE TRAVELING SOUTHBOUND ON A HIGHWAY IN SC ON DEC 22, 2020. THE CRACK STARTED SMALL AND GREW QUICKLY OVER THE COURSE OF MY TRAVEL TO ABOUT 16 - 18 INCHES. THE WINDSHIELD HAD TO BE REPLACED AND THE EYESIGHT SAFETY SYSTEM NEEDED TO BE RECALIBRATED WHICH WAS BOTH TIME CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE. I HAVE TRAVELED A LOT IN MY LIFE WITH MULTIPLE CARS BUT NEVER EXPERIENCED A CRACKED WINDSHIELD THAT SPREADED LIKE IT DID WITH MY NEW OUTBACK. IT IS DISAPPOINTING AND CONCERNING AFTER READING MORE ABOUT THE PENDING LAWSUIT ON DEFECTIVE WINDSHIELDS.
WINDSHIELD SPONTANEOUSLY CRACKED OVERNIGHT. NO MARKING OF ROCK OR ANY DAMAGE.
YESTERDAY MORNING (CAR IS PARKED), I DISCOVERED A CRACK THAT IS ABOUT 4 INCHES LONG ON MY WINDSHIELD AND HAVE GOTTEN LONGER THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND TODAY. CURRENTLY, IT IS ABOUT 26 INCHES ACROSS THE MIDDLE. I LIVE IN AN APARTMENT AND HAVE PERSONAL PARKING WHERE ARE THERE OPEN PARKING AND NOT PARKED UNDER A TREE OR ANYTHING THAT WOULD HAVE FALLEN ON THE WINDSHIELD. THERE ARE NO SPIDERWEB CRACK OR SIGNS (LIKE A ROCK BEING THROWN..ETC) THAT WOULD INDICATE THE WINDSHIELD TO CRACK. I CALLED MY DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY NOR WAS IT RECALLED; EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE NUMEROUS CASES I'VE FOUND ONLINE THAT MANY 2020 OUTBACK OWNERS (AND OTHER SUBARU OWNERS) HAVE EXPERIENCED CRACKED WINDSHIELD FOR NO APPARENT REASON. I JUST BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE ON 29FEB2020; THERE IS NO WAY THAT A WINDSHIELD WOULD CRACK SO SUDDENLY UNLESS IT WAS NOT INSTALLED CORRECTLY OR DEFECTIVE/DUE TO HEATING ELEMENT.
SPONTANEOUS CRACKING OF WINDSHIELD WHILE VEHICLE WAS PARKED.  STARTED AT BOTTOM OF WINDSHIELD APPROX. MIDWAY.  APPROX. 9 INCHES IN LENGTH VERTICALLY THEN CRACK WENT TO PASSENGER SIDE APPROX. 5 INCHES.
LOW BEAMS NEED TO BE ADJUSTED, AS THEY ARE TOO BRIGHT FOR ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  I GET FLASHED AT NIGHT MULTIPLE TIMES, EVEN BY TRUCKERS WHO SIT HIGHER IN THEIR VEHICLES.  THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN BECAUSE IT IMPAIRS THE VISION OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC, AS WELL AS HAD DRIVERS HAVE ROAD RAGE TOWARDS ME, BY THEM SHINING THEIR HIGH BEAMS AT ME.
DRIVING ON A BUSY ROAD, MADE A STOP AT A LIGHT. WHEN I GOT THE GREEN ARROW TO TURN LEFT, CAR JUST DIED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION. WAS FORTUNATE, 4 GOOD INDIVIDUALS JUMPED OUT OF THEIR VEHICLES TO PUSH US OUT OF THE INTERSECTION AND AVOID COLLISION WITH ONCOMING TRAFFIC. CALLED SUBARU FOR A TOW. DURING THE 2 HOUR WAIT, TRIED TO START A COUPLE OF TIMES WITH NO LUCK. WHEN TOW TRUCK ARRIVED, WAS TO PUT IT IN NEUTRAL, SO ATTEMPTED TO START AGAIN, WHICH IT DID. DROVE IMMEDIATELY TO DEALERSHIP. STAYED THERE FOR 2 AND A HALF WEEKS. THEY REPLACED FUEL PUMP, WHICH IN MY MIND, MAY NOT BE AT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM. MY THOUGHTS ARE THAT SOMETHING OVERHEATED, POSSIBLY A CIRCUIT OR SOFTWARE THAT CAUSED THE MALFUNCTION. IT WAS A 95 DEGREE DAY, THE CAR HAD BEEN IDLING FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES IN A STORE PARKING LOT RIGHT BEFORE THE SHUTDOWN. IN TALKING WITH SUBARU, THEY WILL NOT GIVE ME ROOT CAUSE ONCE THEY DO FURTHER ANALYSIS ON THE PROBLEM. I FEEL AT GREAT RISK THIS CAN HAPPEN AT ANY TIME GOING FORWARD, (IE ON THE INTERSTATE, AT AN INTERSECTION, ETC). I'M HOPING THAT LOGGING THIS INCIDENT WILL HELP OTHER OUTBACK OWNERS KNOW OF THE POTENTIAL DANGER THEY MAY BE IN.
THE WINDSHIELD CRACKED BY DRIVES SIDE FOR NO APPARENT REASON WHEN VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION. TOOK THE VEHICLE TO SATELLITE SHOP TO REPAIR THE APPROXIMATELY 1 INCH CRACK ON THE WINDSHIELD AFTER REPAIR DROVE VEHICLE APPROXIMATELY 5 MILES AND CRACK EXTENDED APPROXIMATELY 5 INCHES. SINCE SATURDAY AUGUST 22 WITH VEHICLE STATIONARY ON RESIDENCE DRIVEWAY THE CRACK HAS EXTENDED PAST THE CENTER OF THE VEHICLE IN ONE DIRECTION AND THE BOTTOM OF THE WINDSHIELD IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. *LN *DL
OUR 2020 SUBARU OUTBACK, WITH FEWER THAN 800 MILES,  FAILED TO START FOUR TIMES (6/1, 7/1, 7/10, & 7/13). DURING THESE INCIDENTS, INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR LIGHTS FLASHED, THE DASHBOARD PRODUCED A CLICKING SOUND, THE DOORS WOULD NOT LOCK, AND THE TAILGATE BECAME INOPERATIVE. ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE SUCCESSFULLY JUMP-STARTED THE CAR EACH TIME AND TOOK IT TO TWO DIFFERENT DEALERS FOR DIAGNOSTIC TESTING -- ONE IN SEATTLE AND ONE IN TACOMA.     TWO ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE SERVICE PROVIDERS SAID THEIR MOST FREQUENT SERVICE CALLS REQUIRING A JUMP-START WERE FOR "LATE MODEL SUBARUS. ONE SERVICE TECHNICIAN SAID HE RECEIVED MORE THAN 100 SUCH REQUESTS DURING THE PAST THREE MONTHS.     THE TACOMA DEALER FILED AM URFCA REPORT WITH SUBARU HEADQUARTERS AFTER THE THIRD INCIDENT. DURING THE FOURTH INCIDENT, THE BATTERY FAILED WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS AT THE TACOMA DEALER, WHO REPLACED THE BATTERY ON JULY 13, 2020.     AFTER RECHARGING THE BATTERY, IT TOOK A FEW DAYS OF BEING PARKED BEFORE THE BATTERY FAILED. DURING THIS LAST INCIDENT, I INTENTIONALLY LEFT THE VEHICLE WITH THE DEALER OVER A WEEKEND, WHICH WAS LONG ENOUGH FOR THE RECENTLY CHARGED BATTERY TO DRAIN ENOUGH TO FAIL TO START THE CAR.    WHEN I PICKED UP THE CAR, THE SERVICE ADVISOR TOLD ME THESE CARS NEED TO BE DRIVEN AT LEAST 30 MINUTES PER TRIP TO SUFFICIENTLY RECHARGE THE BATTERY. WE'VE OWNED FIVE SUBARU OUTBACKS, AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS ADVICE BEFORE, NOR DID THE DEALER'S SALES REPRESENTATIVE CALL THIS TO OUR ATTENTION WHEN WE PURCHASED THE 2020 OUTBACK.     OUR LIFESTYLE, COUPLED WITH THE COVID-19 VIRUS, ONLY REQUIRES ONE OR TWO TRIPS PER MONTH LASTING MORE THAN 30 MINUTES. THE CAR SITS IN THE GARAGE FOR TWO TO THREE DAYS WITHOUT BEING STARTED. WE ALWAYS LOCK THE VEHICLE, TURN OFF ALL LIGHTS, CLOSE THE TAILGATE, AND KEEP THE KEY FOB IN THE HOUSE, WHICH IS MORE THAN 500 FEET FROM THE DETACHED GARAGE.
A CRACK SPONTANEOUSLY APPEARED ON MY WINDSHIELD A FEW DAYS AGO..IT LOOKS LIKE AN EDGE CRACK THAT JUST FORMED WHILE IT WAS STATIONARY ON MY DRIVEWAY AND DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE FORMED BY CONTACT WITH ANY OBJECT. THIS CAR IS JUST 4 MONTHS OLD AND HAS NOT BEEN DRIVEN MUCH. I BELIEVE THIS IS A DEFECT IN THE GLASS!  *TR
WINDSHIELD CRACKED FOR NO REASON. THE CAR ONLY HAS 300 MILES ON IT. THE CAR WAS PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY. *TR
I HAVE A 2020 OUTBACK LIMITED AND THE FRONT WINDSHIELD HAS CRACKED TWICE ON IT WHILE DRIVING ON I-75 IN TN. BOTH TIMES A SMALL STONE KICKED UP BY A PASSING CAR HIT THE WINDSHIELD AND BEFORE I COULD GET IT CHECKED OUT BY SAFELITE; IT CRACKED HORIZONTALLY. I HAD THE WINDSHIELD REPLACED AND PAID $1035 TO HAVE IT REPLACED BY A SUBARU DEALER AND LESS THAN TWO WEEKS LATER, ANOTHER SMALL STONE KICKED UP BY A CRV PASSING ME HIT THE NEW SUBARU WINDSHIELD. AGAIN, IT IMMEDIATELY CRACKED HORIZONTALLY AND NOW I WILL HAVE IT REPLACED A SECOND TIME. THERE IS APPEARS TO BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE QUALITY OF THE GLASS:  TOO THIN?  DUE TO THE EYESIGHT SYSTEM NEEDING A VERY OPTICALLY PURE GLASS; PERHAPS THE GLASS IS TOO THIN. BUT THE QUALITY OF THE SUBARU FRONT WINDSHIELD GLASS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO. (I WAS DRIVING AT 70 MPH IN VERY LIGHT TRAFFIC. NO TRUCKS IN AREA.  *TR
WINDSHIELD CRACKED AT LESS THAN 1800 MILES WHILE TRAVELLING DOWN HIGHWAY.  AT LESS THAN 3,000 MILES, ANOTHER CRACK HAD DEVELOPED.  BOTH CRACKS STARTED ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT (PASSENGER SIDE) OF THE WINDSHIELD AND ARE TRAVELLING UP AND TO THE LEFT OF THE WINDSHIELD IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER'S LINE OF SIGHT.
WINDSHIELD CRACKED FROM THE BOTTOM WHEN THE HEATER AND DEFROSTER WERE USED TO PREHEAT THE CAR ON COLD MORNING IN THE DRIVEWAY. THERMAL SHOCK FROM THE OUTSIDE VS INSIDE TEMPERATURE CAUSED THE WINDSHIELD TO CRACK UPWARDS AND THEN SPLIT IN BOTH LATERAL DIRECTIONS. COINCIDENTALLY, THE CAR IS NEW AND WAS MAKING A CREAKING NOISE WHEN I TURNED TO THE RIGHT WHICH I COULD NOT SOURCE. NOW THE WINDOW IS CRACKED AND THE NOISE IS GONE. TELLS ME THE WINDSHIELD WAS TOO TIGHT AND UNDER STRESS.
WINDSHIELD SPONTANEOUSLY CRACKED. ON 12/30/2020 MY WIFE AND I DROVE UP INTO MOUNTAINS TO SPEND NEW YEARS EVE CAMPING. ASCENT WAS 6000+ FEET WITH A SHARP TEMPERATURE CHANGE. TWO CRACKS APPEARED BELOW THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS, THEN JOINED INTO ONE AND SPREAD FURTHER UP THE WINDSHIELD. THE CRACK SEEMED TO OCCUR SHORTLY AFTER TURNING ON THE DEFROST FUNCTION. WE NOTICED THE CRACK WHILE STOPPED. NOTHING HIT THE WINDSHIELD.     I TOOK THE CAR TO OUR DEALER, BOB BAKER SUBARY IN CARLSBAD, CA, BUT THEY DENIED ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CRACK. THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID IT WAS FROM A ROCK AND HE COULD TELL BECAUSE HE HAS 35 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. YET HE FAILED TO ASK A SINGLE QUESTION OF WHEN, WHERE OR HOW IT OCCURRED.
The contact owns a 2021 Subaru Outback. The contact received notification of NHTSA Campaign Number: 24V227000 (Air Bags); however, the part to do the recall repair was not yet available. The local dealer was made aware of the issue and confirmed that parts were not yet available. The contact stated that the manufacturer had exceeded a reasonable amount of time for the recall repair. The manufacturer was made aware of the issue. The contact had not experienced a failure. VIN tool confirms parts not available.
The auto restart does not work and requires a car restart to fix. The latest software update caused this is to happen.
failure/malfunction of thermo coolant control valve some of the systems safety features have been disabled making it unsafe for me to drive vehicle The car gets hot and high beams don’t work heater doesn’t work. Diagnostic was performed by independent mechanic determining this issue Warning lights on dashboard to check engine and many other lights flashed Repairs cost over $1700 which is not affordable especially since this a manufacturer defective part.
Eyesight driver assist went out rendering safety features inoperable. Touch screen also blanked out so unable to adjust a/c, navigation,radio etc. Car had been on long distance all hiway drive and at 7 hours systems failed. Weather was in the 60s, overcast and it was in the afternoon. Pulled into rest stop and turned engine off then restarted but still failed. Drove 2 more hours and next rest stop systems came back after letting car sit off for 10+ minutes.
When there is an alert for “low windshield” washer fluid. I receive multiple audible alerts from the car while driving. The alert will go away and then come back. I think the fluid level sloshes while driving, going above and then below the sensor repeatedly. The multiple alerts are distracting and cause alarm fatigue. I think one alert per driving session would suffice.
Battery had been drained multiple times that required a jump start over the past four months.  Also a new battery was purchased.  No warnings we're presented before the issue occurred.  The latest incident was today.
Hey NHTSA! This needs to be looked into ASAP!! My windshield has broken twice now after getting hit with debris so small I couldn't even hear it hit. I've been driving for 24 years and I've never broke a windshield. The windshield on these is hilariously weak. After they get chipped the crack spreads to the whole windshield in a matter of a couple days. The cracks are also delaminating and letting water in. This needs to be addressed ASAP. It's scary how thin and weak the windscreen is on these. This is a huge safety issue.
We bought this vehicle new and since we have had issues with the infotainment shutting down multiple times while driving.  The infotainment screen along with all safety features associated with the electronic panel turn off.  We have taken it to the dealership multiple times and keep getting told that they can't replicate the problem.  We have recorded the issue and sent proof but Subaru manufacturing keeps delaying any inquiries in hopes to bypass lemon law.
The contact owns a 2021 Subaru Outback. The contact stated that there was a crack on the windshield. There was no impact to the windshield that could have caused the crack. The vehicle was taken to the dealer and diagnosed that a rock chipped the windshield. The dealer informed the contact that the windshield crack was not covered under warranty. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure but denied the claim for the windshield replacement. The vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 19,000.
The vehicle on board computer system periodically goes completely black (i.e., completely shuts down) disabling all of the operator controls (heater/fan/defrost controls, seat heater controls, temp controls, navigation, radio and other dash monitoring and informational controls, etc.).  I am not sure of all features/functions that are lost because it happens when I am driving and I cannot investigate to see what all functions/indications I have lost.   It remains out of service for a short period (the times of the shut down seem to have varied) of time and then comes on and reboots itself.  Sometimes it comes back to where/when it shut down, and sometimes it just comes back to the initial ignition/start screen.  This requires action by the driver (which is a safety concern because it requires the driver's attention and is distracting) to reset control settings.   Navigation sometimes requires resetting an address because the computer lost its destination.   This is dangerous.   I just had the vehicle serviced for this issue and had a Subaru "FIX" installed - that apparently did not work.    The problem still exists.
Drove car and parked for 15 minutes. When I tried to start it again it would not turn over. Battery  was completely dead and could not be jump started. Car is a 2021 model with only 11K miles on it.  There was no prior warning of a low battery. It left me stuck in an isolated parking lot. Probably not a major safety issue but apparently a known issue for late model Subaru Outback’s so I wanted to add the 2021 model to the affected list.
My 2021 Outback  windshield just cracked. My 2020 Outback did the same thing.  Apparently  three class action lawsuits are not enough for them to fix the windshield problem. $1200 to fix, on a brand new car. looks like the St. Louis Arch.
CRACK IN WINDSHIELD APPEARED WITH NO PUNCTURE. NOTICED CRACK WHEN DRIVING ON HIGHWAY. NOTHING HAD HIT THE WINDSHIELD, PASSENGER NOTICED THE CRACK.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2021 SUBARU OUTBACK. THE CONTACT STATED WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED, SHE NOTICED A BUBBLE IN THE FRONT WINDSHIELD. ADDITIONALLY, WHILE DRIVING AT UNKNOWN SPEEDS, THE FRONT WINDSHIELD CRACKED APPROXIMATELY TWELVE INCHES WITHOUT IMPACT. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO JIM ARMSTRONG SUBARU (2321 U.S. HWY 70 SW, HICKORY, NC 28602, (828) 322-9372) WHERE THE DEALER DIAGNOSED THE VEHICLE AND DETERMINED THAT THE WINDSHIELD HAD BEEN IMPACTED BY AN UNKNOWN OBJECT.

Windshield requires replacement with slightest rock hit to it- (2) replacements in first six months of car ownership
The contact owns a 2022 Subaru Outback. The contact stated that after parking the vehicle on a slightly inclined driveway, the vehicle erroneously rolled backwards. The failure occurred on several occasions and the parking brake was not activated. The vehicle was taken to the local dealer on two separate occasions, but no cause for the failure was found. The manufacturer was notified of the failure, but no assistance was offered. The failure mileage was 13,927.
The contact owns a 2022 Subaru Outback. The contact stated that the windshield had cracked after an impact. The vehicle was taken to Safelite Auto Glass, where the windshield was replaced; however, the failure recurred. The vehicle was taken to the dealer, where the windshield was inspected, and the dealer confirmed that the windshield had cracked due to an impact. The vehicle was not repaired. The vehicle was taken back to Safelite Auto Glass, and the windshield replacement was covered by the Insurance provider; however, the failure persisted. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and a case was re-opened. The failure mileage was approximately 16,000.
In the two years I have had this vehicle, I have had to replace the windshield twice. The first time, a pebble hit the windshield and a 6-8 inch crack immediately appeared, The crack increased in size over days and nearly went across the whole windshield. Because this was a few months after purchase, Subaru replaced it. Now in March 2024 and another pebble hit the windshield, this one so small i didn't even see it and a 8 inch crack immediately appeared. The crack increased in days as well. Subaru would not cover it and told me to go through my insurance. I waited to get it repaired and during this time another pebble hit the glass. Again, another 6-8 inch crack. Subaru refuses to take responsibility that this is a manufacturer issue. I've had 3 other Subaru vehicles and this never occurred.
The contact owns a 2022 Subaru Outback. The contact stated while driving at an undisclosed speed with the defroster activated, within two hours, the contact observed that the front windshield had cracked just above the defroster vents. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic, who determined that the temperature difference between the interior and exterior of the vehicle resulted in thermal shock. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure but provided no assistance. The failure mileage was 14,000.
Less than 3 months ago I reported 11543521.  Now, the very first rock to hit this new OEM replacement windshield caused a 7-8 inch crack to form in the middle and start to propagate.  There are still less than 8000 miles on the car.
I've experienced problems with the center Infotainment screen about 2 months after purchasing a 2022 Outback Wilderness edition. It seems to happen when I use Apple CarPlay (as this is the only way I listen to music and must plug in my phone using the USB to start CarPlay). The Infotainment screen has a long lag time to respond to clicks on the center screen, will freeze, and crash the system suddenly. The most extreme effect of this is that when the Infotainment screen crashes/freezes, the EyeSight safety features of the car such as Lane Keeping Assistance, Blind Spot Warning, Forward Crash Warning also stop working. I'll see all of the dashboard signals and notifications on the dashboard screen indicating the features are disabled. Additionally, I'm unable to control the AC when the screen crash happens. This happens while the vehicle is in operation and the vehicle user manual doesn't provide any troubleshoot options. Sometimes the screen will remain on after I've turned the car off. I can only hope the screen will shut off and restart after I've completely shut the car off to "fix this". There have been many times I've had to keep driving without the Eyesight safety features or AC when the screen crashes. I've tried to update the Infotainment screen myself with the supposedly "over the air" updates Subaru offers. It says my system is up to date even though I've found online Subaru service bulletins saying there are new software versions released. At my first six month dealer service, I asked about  released updates and the service manager denied the newest updates can be installed on my car (which is STILL less than a year old). I brought my vehicle to another subaru dealership with this issue and they said they are aware of it. The service manager also said that the software update only fixes about 20% of vehicles that have this issue and a full replacement of the center screen unit is likely needed. Why has the NHTSA not directed Subaru to issue a recall?
Windshield developed a major crack all the way across it from the smallest nick 36 hours after the Nick occurred. This makes me very concerned for the integrity of the windshield in a crash. I am far from the only report of such an item.
Never had a windshield so sensitive in the many many cars I've owned over the years. We haver had several chips filled that just randomly appear on the glass and never heard or saw anything hit. Finally one morning went out to the car to find a 12" long crack on the passenger side of the windshield. Paid my deductible and had it replaced and the NEXT DAY, less than 24 hours later sitting in a parking lot and it randomly cracked again. Took it back to the repair shop and they said it wasn't a problem with their install and I need to pay AGAIN for another windshield? These things shouldn't be cracking and chipping this easily.
The car was parked in my driveway overnight and developed a cracked windshield without any viable impact from an outside object. The crack is midway up.
Windshield spontaneously cracked on lower right side. Crack spread within minutes across entire windshield. This happened in May 2022 in fairly decent temperatures in the upper 60’s
My windshield cracked from the driver side to almost half of the whole thing without any impact being seen outside or inside at all. This is scary and can be a safety hazard. It can happen even when driving. I saw a lot of people complaining and experienced the same thing about the Subaru Outback's windshield and other models, which is scary. My car is only seven months old, and this is happening already. Some people have changed their windshield five times already. I bought the car because it's supposed to be safe and reliable, but now I don't feel safe with my windshield.
Windshield cracked while driving did not see anything large object hit
Spontaneous 18" windshield crack on the driver's side with no impact point noted. Completely unprovoked.
SafeLite is Unable to calibrate vehicle EyeSight after non-OEM windshield replacement. Yes the vehicle is available for inspection upon request. The vehicle has not been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others. There have been two attempts to calibrate the vehicle EyeSight by SafeLite. The dealer says the EyeSight with a non-OEM windshield can not be properly calibrated.  According to Subaru, the 2022 model requires that OEM glass be used for windshield replacements on models that are equipped with the EyeSight Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS).  Lane detection works randomly, periodically there a warning beep showing a vehicle icon between two bars and the word "Off" .  In addition to the alarms, the Vehicle Dynamics Control (VDC) keeps nudging the steering wheel causing the vehicle to swerve. None of the front safe driving features of the vehicle can be trusted.  The steering nudging problem doesn't happen when the VDC is turned off. The VDC defaults to on. To safely drive the vehicle the VDC needs to be manually turned off each time the car is started.  No the problem has not been confirmed by a dealer or independent service center. I assume the vehicle logs have a record of the warnings.
My windshield simply cracked for no reason that I can tell. I parked it in garage and came out the next morning and there was a crack all the way across to middle of the car. Started on the driver side mid height of the windshield and ran horizontally to just under the eyesight cameras.  I don't see where anything hit it or chipped it.
The windshield was hit by a rock chip, and a tiny divot formed. Within minutes, it had spider-webbed out with cracks stretching 12-18" in multiple directions.  I've never seen such a tiny divot propagate so rapidly - I've had the car < 14 days. From the sound of the impact, I would have expected the windshield to shrug off the hit with no damage. The ongoing propagation makes me seriously consider whether the windshield is actually safe - the entire thing seems like it's under internal stress that could result in a catastrophic failure from minor impacts.  The dealer/manufacturer have not inspected the problem, but I'll bring it to them ASAP.
Driving down the road for work, coworker noticed i had a crack in my windshield. At no time did there ever seem to be a strike to the windshield that would cause it to crack.  Now a few days later this crack has grown to the length of roughly 16".  The windshield seems to be very thin and brittle, which seems unsafe.  They are also very expensive to fix, due to the safety system installed in the car, which seems counterintuitive since the windshields break so easy, which then causes the safety system to not work correctly.
No warning. At about 943 miles on my brand new 2022 Subaru Outback Limited XT the Windshield cracked from bottom center to the middle straight up approximately1 foot. After sitting in the driveway, not being driven at all, it has cracked more, from the center to each side, approximately 2 feet. Now it's a huge "T" crack.
The contact owns a 2022 Subaru Outback. The contact stated while driving 60 MPH, a rock struck and cracked the passenger’s side windshield. The contact was able to continue driving to the residence. The contact took the vehicle to an independent mechanic who replaced the windshield with a factory windshield. However, a few weeks later the contact entered the vehicle and noticed a new crack had formed on the driver’s side of the windshield and had started to expand. The contact stated that there was no impact to the windshield to cause the crack. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 6,000.
Windshield has cracked for no apparent reason (no rock impact, etc.).  Crack begins at edge of passenger side windshield. Newly purchased in November.
The bracket on the front right side of the drivers seat (if you're looking at the seat from the sunroof) that connects the seat (where you sit) to the seat frame (which moves the seat forward and back) has separated from the seat frame. The two tack welds have failed so the seat can move freely up and down on the right side of the seat. This issue seems to particularly affect the 2010 model year Subaru Forester as documented by the forum thread: [XXX]  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
MY BRAKES FAILED WHILE I WAS DRIVING BECAUSE SUBARU DID NOT PROPERLY ADDRESS RECALL WQK47 ON MY CAR IN 2018 EVEN THOUGH THEY CLAIMED IT WAS COMPLETED. MY BRAKE LINES ARE COMPLETELY CORRODED AND THEY ARE REFUSING TO HONOR THE RECALL THAT THEY IMPROPERLY ADDRESSED 2 YEARS AGO. THEY KNEW IN 2018 WHEN THEY APPLIED THE ANTI-RUST SOLUTION THAT THE BRAKE LINES WERE RUSTED BUT THEY DID NOT DO ANY REPAIRS. THUS, MY CAR IS CURRENTLY NON-FUNCTIONING.
THE DOOR LOCK MECHANISM LOCKS ITSELF IMMEDIATELY AFTER I UNLOCK THE DOOR. I CAN'T GET MY DRIVERS SIDE DOOR TO STAY UNLOCKED IN ORDER TO CLOSE THE DOOR. HAVING TO HOLD THE DOOR TIGHT WHILE DRIVING IS OBVIOUSLY NOT SAFE. I HAVE LOOKED ONLINE AND FOUND QUITE A FEW POSTS FROM PEOPLE WITH THE SAME ISSUE.
THE DRIVER'S SEAT BOTTOM FRAME CAME UNWELDED AT THE FRONT LEFT SIDE OF THE FRAME. THE PART BROKE WHEN THE CAR WAS STATIONARY. THE DRIVER'S LEFT LEG IS NOW UNSUPPORTED AND THE SEAT BOTTOM MOVES FREELY. NUMEROUS OTHER REPORTS OF THE SAME PROBLEM HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED ON OTHER WEBSITES.

HELLO-    I AM EXPERIENCING CONTINUED ISSUES AFTER RECALL: 16V-738.    I BEGAN ATTEMPTING TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE IN SEPTEMBER OF 2016. THE ISSUE IMPACTS THE SECONDARY AIR SYSTEM AND MY VEHICLE WOULD NOT PASS CA SMOG. I HAVE TO HAVE A PASSING SMOG TO RENEW MY CA REGISTRATION.    I FAILED SMOG AND SENT THE VEHICLE TO MY MECHANIC. MY  MECHANIC PERFORMED DIAGNOSIS AND DETERMINED STORED P2441 AND P2443 CODES (SECONDARY AIR VALVES OPEN).    AROUND THE SAME TIME, OCTOBER 2016, SUBARU RELEASED RECALL: 16V-738. THIS ADDRESSES A SINGLE RELAY IN THE SECONDARY AIR SERIES. I PROCEEDED TO SCHEDULE AND TAKE MY VEHICLE INTO RANCHO GRANDE SUBARU IN SAN LUIS OBISPO. I ALSO OPENED A CLAIM WITH SUBARU CORPORATE CUSTOMER SUPPORT SR #:1-19856672948).   SUBARU BEGAN WORKING ON MY VEHICLE MID OCTOBER 2016 AND PLACED ME IN A RENTAL SUV.     I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY COMMUNICATION FROM SUBARU, SO I FOLLOWED UP. THE TECH INFORMED ME THE VEHICLE IS READY TO BE PICKED UP MID NOVEMBER. I VISITED, PICKED UP THE VEHICLE, DROVE IT 3 MILES AND HEARD A LOUD SCREECH FROM THE SECONDARY AIR PUMP. I RETURNED THE VEHICLE, INFORMED THE TECH AND HE RUDELY RESPONDED "WAS THAT NOISE HAPPENING WHEN YOU DROPPED IT OFF". NO, I RESPONDED AND THEY RESISTED PLACING ME IN A RENTAL FOR ANOTHER 3 WEEKS.     LATE DECEMBER, I FOLLOWED UP ONCE AGAIN DUE TO LACK OF COMMUNICATION AND THE VEHICLE WAS READY 3 DAYS LATER. I DROVE THE VEHICLE 200 MILES AND NOW THE SAME CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS ON, TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT IS FLASHING AND VEHICLE INTERMITTENTLY ACCELERATED. I CHECKED THE CODES AND THE SAME CODES REMAIN. I FEEL THE SCOPE OF COMPONENTS REQUIRES ALL COMPONENTS IN THE SECONDARY AIR SYSTEM TO BE REPLACED. THE FAULTY RELAY WAS ON THE ON POSITION AND HAS EXHAUSTED ALL THE COMPONENTS IN THE SERIES.     THIS IS A NATION WIDE ISSUE DO  HTTP://WWW.SUBARUFORESTER.ORG/VBULLETIN/F87/SECONDARY-AIR-VALVES-P2443-P2441-63347/. T
WE HAVE RECEIVED THE MANDATORY RECALL LETTER OF JULY 2016.  THE OPEN-ENDED STATEMENT: "WE WILL NOTIFY YOU WHEN REPLACEMENT PARTS ARE AVAILABLE"  IS INSUFFICIENT.  WHY? BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE A RECALL NOTICE FOR OUR 2013 LEAF WHICH IS ALREADY THREE MONTHS OLD AND THUS FAR NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE WITH THAT.  I AM ANGRY BECAUSE NOW THE "FAMILY" CAR CANNOT BE USED AS A FAMILY CAR!  SO THE QUESTION IS WHEN?? WILL PARTS BE AVAILABLE NEXT YEAR?  5 YEARS FROM NOW?? WHEN???

WHILE CRUISING AT 40 MPH UP A SLIGHT INCLINE, THE ENGINE SUDDENLY JERKED A FEW TIMES, THEN STOPPED. I WAS ABLE TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO MY MECHANIC'S GARAGE WHERE HE DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A FAILURE OF THE AIR CONDITIONING UNIT TO OPEN THE VALVE WHICH ALLOWS COOL AIR TO ENTER THE CABIN. THE AIR CONDITIONING UNIT LITERALLY FROZE, RESULTING IN THE BELT WHICH ENGAGES THE ENGINE STOPPING AND CAUSING THE PISTONS TO STOP WHILE THE VALVES KEPT MOVING. SEVERE ENGINE DAMAGE RESULTED WHICH REQUIRED MACHINING OF CYLINDER HEADS AND REPLACEMENT OF MANY PARTS. IF THIS INCIDENT HAD HAPPENED GOING AT HIGH SPEED ON A HIGHWAY, SERIOUS INJURY OR FATALITY MAY HAVE OCCURRED.  *TR
AT 23,486 MILES, I TOOK MY CAR TO MY LOCAL AND VERY REPUTABLE GARAGE THAT SPECIALIZES IN SUBARUS.  ONCE THEY GOT MY CAR IN THE SHOP, THEY TOLD ME I WAS NOT GOING ANYWHERE AS THE CAR WAS DANGEROUS. IT WAS TOWED TO ST. J. SUBARU WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR.  THE LEFT REAR PAD WAS MISSING AND THE CALIPER HAD BEEN HITTING ON THE ROTOR AND RUIN THE CALIPER. AT THAT INITIAL REPAIR, THE SUBARU SERVICE PERSON SAID:     "WE'VE HAD SOME PREMATURE WEAR WITH THE BACK BRAKES FOR SOME REASON."    20,000 MILES LATER, THE SAME THING HAS HAPPENED AGAIN AND THE DEALER GAVE THE PARTY LINE...TO BAD, WARRANTY UP.  IT APPEARS THERE IS SOME MANUFACTURER DEFECT WITH THE BRAKES.  PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS RIGHT AWAY AS I CANNOT AFFORD TO REPLACE BRAKES EVERY 20,000 MILES.  THANK YOU.    *TR
NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER: 12V099000  SUBARU'S RECALL CAMPAIGN NUMBER IS WQA-37.  I HAD THIS RECALL DONE AND WANT TO INFORM YOU ABOUT THIS NEW SAFETY ISSUE.  SUBARU HAS THIS RECALL ON REAR SEAT BELTS BUCKLES. PER THE SUBARU MECHANIC, THEY ARE EXCHANGING TWO BUCKLES AND TWISTING THE NEW ONES TOGETHER DURING THE INSTALLATION. THE NEW INSTALLED BUCKLES ARE SHORTER! IN ADDITION, THEY ARE TWISTING THEM TOGETHER WHICH IS UNSAFE AND MAKES THEM EVEN SHORTER!   THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE!  NEW BUCKLES BEING SHORTER DO NOT COME OUT OF THE SEAT MAKING IT EXTREMELY HARD IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO BUCKLE ANY ONE OR ALL THREE REAL BELTS WHEN A PERSON SITS IN THERE LET ALONE WHEN YOU HAVE A CHILD SEAT IN PLACE. BECAUSE THE BUCKLES ARE SO SHORT AND EXTREMELY HARD TO REACH AND WORK WITH, MANY TIMES UNKNOWINGLY YOU DON?T LOCK THE SEAT BELT IN THE BUCKLE BECAUSE IT STAYS IN, WHICH CREATES FALSE FEELING OF SECURITY AND A SAFETY ISSUE.  SUBARU MECHANIC TOLD ME THEY HAVE RECEIVED MULTIPLE COMPLAINS FROM FORESTER OWNERS ABOUT THIS ISSUE.    2010 SUBARU FORESTER, X (BASE) MODEL.    *JS
TL*THE CONTACT OWNS A 2010 SUBARU FORESTER. WHILE DRIVING AT ANY SPEED, THE CONTACT TURNED ON THE HEATER/AIR CONDITIONER/FAN SHE SMELLED A TOXIC, NAUSEATING ODOR. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN AUTHORIZED DEALER WHO STATED THAT IT WAS A NEW VEHICLE ODOR. THE CONTACT CALLED THE MANUFACTURER WHO STATED THAT THE ODOR WAS PROBABLY MORE NOTICEABLE IN COLD WEATHER. THE VEHICLE HAD NOT BEEN REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS UNKNOWN AND THE CURRENT MILEAGE WAS 4,834.
My car randomly turns off when reducing speed.  It caused an accident a few days ago. I have had multiple mechanics try to figure out the problem but the only thing that comes up on the diagnostic tool is it needed 1 coil replaced. They have all been replaced and still won't go away. The Che k engine light is on. And the car uses about a quart or more of oil everytime I fill up but has no leaks. When I reduce speed the car in traffic, around corners or to stop it constantly turns itself off. Starting it it sometimes turns itself off if I don't give it some gas at the same time. It smells like burning oil constantly.
WHILE BACKING OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY THE INTAKE VALVE SPRING BROKE AND DROPPED THE VALVE INTO THE CYLINDER CAUSING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO REPAIR
OUR FORESTER HAS BEEN BURNING AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF OIL. THOUGHT IT WAS LEAKS AT FIRST AND HAVE SPENT ABOUT 2500 FIXING THOSE. KEEPS LOSING OIL SO MUST BE BURNING IT. TOOK AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST AT DEALER WHICH LASTS 1200 MILES. FAILED BECAUSE IT DIDN'T MAKE IT 650 MILES BEFORE IT RAN OUT OF OIL. SUBARU DID NOTHING TO HELP WITH THIS PROBLEM. SOON AFTER IT IS NOW STARTING TO THROW CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS. TWICE NOW THE ENGINE HAS ALSO DIED WHILE I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF DRIVING. ONCE WAS ON THE HIGHWAY AND THE OTHER WAS LUCKILY BEFORE TURNING INTO A PARKING LOT
OUR SUBARU FORESTER BEGAN TICKING, LIKE A LIFTER WAS STICKING, AND THE OIL LEVEL OF THE SYNTHETIC OIL WAS PERFECT.  THEN THE CAR BEGAN TO HAVE A BURNING SMELL FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  WE TOOK THE CAR TO OUR DEALER HUEBUEGER, COLO. SPRINGS, COLORADO.  THE TECH INFORMED US THAT THE CAR HAD TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS ABOUT THESE ISSUES.  THE TECH ALSO SAID THAT A TSB IS ISSUED BY AN AUTO MAKER WHEN THERE IS A GROWING TREND WITH AN UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM, BUT DOES NOT WARRANT A RECALL.  HE SAID THE IRREGULAR STAMPING OF CAMSHAFT POSITION SENSOR PLATES CAUSED THE EVENTUAL TICKING AND LEAKING FROM THE CAMSHAFT CARRIER ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ENGINE AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR VEHICLE NOW WARRANTING A $4,500 REPAIR.  SINCE THE ISSUE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A FACTORY DEFECT I CALLED SUBARU SUPPORT EXPECTING FINANCIAL HELP TO RID THE CAR OF THE DEFECT.  THE WOMAN WAS VERY OBTUSE AND PRETENDED NOT TO UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE OF RESPONSIBILITY OF SUBARU.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE REASON FOR TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS BEING RELEASED ONLY TO DEALERSHIPS AND MECHANICS.  ISN'T IT LOGICAL AND REASONABLE TO ALERT THE OWNERS OF VEHICLES THAT MAY DEVELOP OIL LEAKS THAT COULD LEAD TO A VEHICLE FIRE ?  ISN'T SUBARU ADMITTING RESPONSIBILITY BY ISSUING A TSB FOR A GROWING TREND WITH AN UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM.  IT SEEMS IRRESPONSIBLE FOR THE NHTSA AND SUBARU NOT TO NOTIFY OWNERS OF IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS THAT COULD LEAD TO SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUES.  PLEASE RESPOND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, I AM 69 YEARS OLD AND THIS ISSUE AND THE FINANCIAL STRAIN IS VERY IMPORTANT.  THE APPLICABLE COMMUNICATION #"S OF THE TSB IS 02-131-12R OF OCT. 2, 2012, 060000 ENGINE (PWS).  SB-11-100 HR, NOVEMBER 27, 2012,  IRREGULAR STAMPING OF CAMSHAFT POSITION SENSOR PLATE.  THE BURNING SMELL BECAME OVERPOWERING ON THE WAY TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THE TECH ADVISES THAT AN OIL LEAK IS COMING FROM THE CAM CARRIERS ON BOTH SIDES DEFECTS

MY WIFE'S CAR LOCKED ITSELF WITH KEYS AND BABY INSIDE ON TWO OCCASIONS.  THE FIRST TIME WAS IN WINTER (DON'T REMEMBER THE DATE) AND OUR BABY WAS LOCKED IN THE COLD CAR FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR WHILE WE WAITED FOR AAA.  MY WIFE THOUGHT SHE HAD SOMEHOW KNEELED ON THE KEY/REMOTE IN HER HANDBAG WHILE PUTTING THE BABY IN HIS CAR SEAT. SINCE THEN SHE HAS TAKEN CARE NOT TO TOUCH THE KEY (AND REMOTE) BEFORE SHE GETS IN THE CAR TO DRIVE.  TODAY SHE PLACED THE KEY/REMOTE ON THE FRONT SEAT, THEN PUT THE BABY IN THE CAR SEAT (IN BACK), CLOSED THE BACK DOOR, AND THE CAR LOCKED ITSELF WITH HER OUTSIDE AND THE BABY INSIDE.  AAA ARRIVED QUICKLY AND OPENED THE CAR.  THE AAA GUY SAID HE HAS HAD MORE SUBARUS WITH DRIVERS LOCKED OUT THAN ANY OTHER MAKE.  I ALSO SPOKE TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF THE SUBARU DEALER WHO SOLD US THE CAR ABOUT THIS INCIDENT, AND I WAS TOLD THAT THIS MODEL YEAR HAD EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM FAIRLY OFTEN, AND THAT THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN FIXED IN SUBSEQUENT MODELS.

I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THIS VEHICLE THAT CLAIMS TO BE REPAIRED- THE IGNITION TURNING OFF WHILE DRIVING. THIS HAPPENED A FEW MINUTES AGO WHILE DRIVING 65+ ON THE FREEWAY AND WE WERE ALMOST HIT BY AN 18 WHEELER BECAUSE OF IT. ZERO POWER WHATSOEVER. I WAS ABLE TO PUT IT IN NEUTRAL AND TURN THE KEY A FEW TIMES AND RESTART IT. AFTERWARDS, THE CHECK ENGINE, STABILITY CONTROL, TIRE PRESSURE, SEATBELT LIGHTS ARE ALL ON, CRUISE CONTROL IS FLASHING (I DON'T USE CRUISE). I DON'T KNOW HOW THE INCLUDED PICTURE HELPS. I FEEL LIKE THIS ISSUE WAS EITHER ABSOLUTELY NOT ADDRESSED, OR IF IT WAS, THE REPAIR HAS DEFINITELY FAILED.

THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE ISSUE. THE CONTACT HAD NOT EXPERIENCED A FAILURE. PARTS DISTRIBUTION DISCONNECT. *TT  CONSUMER STATED HE CALLED THE DEALER ON 3/15 FOR AIRBAG RECALL. CONSUMER'S APPOINTMENT WAS 8/20/19. DEALER CALLED BACK FEW DAYS LATER AND MOVED THE APPOINTMENT TO 4/16/19.*JB
I PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY, WHICH HAS A SLIGHT INCLINE, PUT CAR IN PARK BUT LEFT IGNITION RUNNING AND HEADLIGHTS ON. I HAVE PARKED IN THIS SPACE SEVEN YEARS AND WAS NOT IN  HABIT OF  PULLING THE PARKING BRAKE. I HAD A VISITOR WHO NEEDED TO SEE DECK STEPS AS IT WAS NIGHTTIME. WE BOTH GOT OUT, WENT UP THE STEPS AND I RETURNED TO TURN OFF CAR.  WHEN I LEAVE KEYS IN IGNITION I KEEP DRIVER'S DOOR AJAR TO PREVENT UNWANTED  LOCKING. I OPEN DOOR, LEAN IN TO TURN OFF KEY. BEFORE I CAN REACH THE KEY,  THE CAR STARTS ROLLING BACKWARDS. I THROW MYSELF SIDEWAYS TO AVOID CAR ROLLING OVER ME. BECAUSE OF INCLINE, CAR GATHERS SLIGHT SPEED AS IT ROLLS ABOUT 40-50 FEET DOWN DRIVEWAY (I LIVE ON A HILL AND DRIVEWAY INCLINE IS MORE PRONOUNCED FARTHER DOWN). IT VEERS SLIGHTLY TO LEFT AND I HEAR A "THUD." ENGINE STOPS, HEADLIGHTS GO OUT, AS BEST I RECALL. CAR WAS STOPPED BY A SIX-INCH DIAMETER TREE. WHEN I GET BACK IN, I HAVE TO ROCK THE STEERING WHEEL BACK AND FORTH TO GET THE IGNITION STARTED AND DRIVE CAR BACK TO PARKING SPOT. ODD THING IS THAT WHEN I GET IN THE CAR TO MOVE IT FROM TREE, THE GEAR IS IN "PARK." DAMAGE IS SUBSTANTIAL, NEARLY $10,000 BECAUSE OF WHERE IT HIT IN THE BACK AND INVOLVED THE EXPENSIVE EMISSIONS SYSTEM. I HAVE TRIED TO RECREATE THIS, PUTTING GEAR IN BOTH NEUTRAL  AND REVERSE AT SAME PARKING SPOT. I STRONGLY BELIEVE IF I HAD UNKNOWINGLY LEFT IT IN REVERSE, IT WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY STARTED ROLLING BACKWARD; IF I'D LEFT IT IN NEUTRAL, THE WEIGHT SHIFT OF GETTING OUT OF THE CAR AND SLAMMING CLOSED ONE OF THE DOORS WOULD HAVE STARTED IT ROLLING BACKWARD AT THAT TIME, NOT LATER.  USSA TOLD ME SUBARU HAS NOT OWNED UP TO ANY ROLLBACK PROBLEMS WHEN THE CAR IS IN PARK AND ON A SLIGHT INCLINE BUT I FOUND A SIMILAR ROLLBACK IN A SUBARU FORUM FOR A CAR THAT WAS SAME YEAR, SAME MODEL AND LOW MILEAGE, AS MINE IS. I NOW USE PARKING BREAK ALL THE TIME, NO LONGER TRUSTING THE CAR.
I HAD A SIDE IMPACT ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE THAT CRUSHED THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER DOORS AND BLEW OUT THE DRIVER'S WINDOW. THE IMPACT NEARLY CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO ROLL OVER AND AGAIN THE SIDE AIR BAG DID NOT DEPLOY. I WAS SLIGHTLY INJURED BUT THERE WERE SERIOUS INJURIES IN THE OTHER VEHICLES INVOLVED. I AM CONCERNED THIS MAY BE A DEFECT IN THE SENSOR SYSTEM. THE DRIVER'S DOOR WAS CRUSHED ALL THE WAY IN TO THE SEAT.
Basically, as I was driving on the freeway with my son and his brother, I got 5 lights flashing on dashboard. Abs at temp check engine cruise control hill assist vss etc.. the code were for cut but before I could check them everything shut down. Car went dark, no brakes and burning smell as well as burns oil. Front end damage on car with passenger side damage. Car started back up next day called Subaru and because it’s 2014 forester, may not qualify but it only has 126k on the dash. Well maintained and had no issues besides the oil consumption.
The contact owns a 2014 Subaru Forester. The contact stated while driving approximately 30 MPH, the check engine and oil warning lights were illuminated. The contact stated that the vehicle was consuming a quart of engine oil every 1,000 miles. The contact had taken the vehicle to a local dealer, where it was diagnosed and determined that the short block needed to be replaced. The vehicle had not been repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The contact researched online and related the failure to TSB Number: 02-157-14R (Engine and Engine Cooling). The failure mileage was approximately 97,000.
Right trunk tail gate broke at pivot point due to rust. I had lifted the rear trunk door up to remove packages when the trunk door suddenly came down on my head. Subaru had issued a warning about this but this should be a recall!! I was thankful a child was not standing next to me! The dealer replaced both gates when I complained.
The contact owns a 2014 Subaru Forester. The contact stated while driving approximately 50 mph, a small crack appeared on the front windshield without impact. While driving, the crack expanded from the passenger’s side of the windshield to the driver’s side. The cause of the failure was not yet determined. The manufacturer and local dealer were not yet notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 40,000.
THE HORN HAS STOPPED WORKING
AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT IS LIT ON THE MAIN CLUSTER BEHIND THE STEERING WHEEL AND ALSO ON THE CENTER DISPLAY. I BELIEVE THE SYSTEM IS FAULTY AND I'M SEEING AN OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ONLINE. I'M WORRIED THE AIRBAGS WILL NOT DEPLOY IN AN ACCIDENT. MY CAR HAS NEVER BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT, I HAVE NEVER SPILLED FLUIDS ON THE SEATS WHICH SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PHRASE COMING FROM MECHANICS AT SUBARU SERVICE CENTERS.  SUBARU SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR SAFETY SYSTEMS. THEY SHOULD DIAGNOSE AND FIX THIS SAFETY PROBLEM. THIS IS NOT A PART THAT THAT EXPERIENCES WEAR AND TEAR LIKE BRAKE PADS.  IF IT WAS, I'D HAPPILY PAY OUT OF POCKET TO REPLACE. I DON'T WANT TO WAIT AND SEE IF AIRBAGS GO OFF IN AN ACCIDENT.  SUBARU HAS ALREADY ISSUED A RECALL FOR 2015-2018 MODELS. THIS TELLS ME THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR AIRBAG SYSTEMS AND NEGLECTED TO ADDRESS ISSUES ON 2014 MODELS.
WHEN GETTING REAR WHEEL BEARING REPLACED MECHANIC ADVISED THAT BOTH REAR COIL SPRINGS WERE BROKEN. NO KNOWN CAUSE.
MY SUBARU FORESTOR FROM 2014 HAS A FAULTY AIRBAG SYSTEM FOR THE PASSENGER SEAT. IT SAYS THAT IT IS OFF WHEN A PASSENGER IS IN THE SEAT AND GIVES THE WARNING LIGHT. WHEN NO ONE IS IN THE SEAT IT STILL BEEPS SOMETIMES AND I CAN ONLY STOP IT BY BUCKLING THE SEAT. THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND IS SUBARU'S FAULT. I HAVE NEVER SPILLED ANYTHING ON THE PASSENGER SEAT AND IT JUST FAILED. THIS ISSUE HAPPENS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT AND IS RANDOM IN THE CAR.I TOOK IT TO SUBARU AND THEY SAID THAT I SPILLED SOMETHING ON THE SEAT AND WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE WHOLE SENSOR FOR OVER $1200.  I HAVE SEEN COMPLAINTS FROM SUBARU MODELS OF ALL KINDS WITH THE SAME ISSUE ON MULTIPLE WEBSITES. IT IS IN A VARIETY OF MODELS AND DIFFERENT YEAR CARS.
FRONT PASSENGER SEAT AIR BAG SENSOR, FRONT  PASSENGER SEAT OCCUPANCY SENSOR,  FRONT PASSENGER SEAT AIRBAG COMPUTER, RED AIR BAG WARNING LIGHT, YELLOW PASSENGER AIRBAG "ON/OFF" LIGHT, SEAT BELT WARNING AND CHIME.  AIR BAG DISABLED WARNING INTERMITTENTLY COMES ON WHEN PASSENGER SEAT IS OCCUPIED, SEAT BELT FASTENED, CAR OUT OF GEAR, STATIONARY.  SOMETIMES STOPPING ENGINE, KEY OFF AND REMOVED, THEN ENGINE RESTARTED WILL RESET THIS WARNING.  OTHER TIMES DURING NORMAL DRIVING, PASSENGER SEAT OCCUPIED, SEAT BELT LATCHED,  AIR BAG WARNING (RED) LIGHT WILL OCCURS AND YELLOW PASS AIRBAG ACTIVE LIGHT WILL INDICATE PASSENGER AIR  BAG INACTIVE.   WHEN FRONT PASS SEAT EMPTY OR WITH WEIGHT AS LIGHT AS 2 POUNDS ON THE SEAT, SEAT BELT WARNING LIGHT AND CHIME COMES ON WHEN SPEED EXCEEDS 5 MPH.  SOMETIMES THIS ALARM CAN BE RESET BY SHARPLY STRIKING SEAT, SOMETIMES NOT, AND TRIP MUST BE COMPLETED WITH THE SEAT BELT BUCKLED.  IN THIS CASE THE PASSENGER AIRBAG LIGHT USUALLY SHOWS INACTIVE.  THE SEAT BELT ISSUE HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR ABOUT 2 YEARS, GETTING MORE FREQUENT.  THE AIRBAG ISSUE HAS BEEN HAPPENING DURING THE LAST TWO MONTHS, STARTING JUST AFTER THE STOP LIGHT SWITCH RECALL MAINTENANCE WAS PERFORMED AT SUBARU DEALER IN LAS VEGAS, NV.
CVT TRANSMISSION FAILURE OF MY 2014 SUBARU FORESTER TOURING 2.0 TURBO MODEL. WHEN I PUT THE CAR INTO PARK AND TURNED OFF THE CAR AFTER DRIVING, IT DID NOT TURN OFF THE DASHBOARD LIGHTS, THE BELTS WERE STILL SPINNING AND I HAD TO REMOVE THE BATTERY TO SHUT IT OFF. 1 WEEK LATER THE BATTERY WAS DEAD. I JUMP STARTED AND THE ENGINE LIGHT AND OTHER ALERTS WERE ALL LIT. WHEN I BROUGHT THE CAR TO MY MECHANIC, HE RAN DIAGNOSTICS AND SAID THE TRANSMISSION WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED. THE CAR IS ONLY 5 YEARS OLD. TOP OF THE LINE SUBARU AND  I ONLY HAVE 56,860 MILES ON THE CAR.
PASSENGER SIDE REAR COIL SPRING BROKE.  THIS DIDN'T SEEM TO HAPPEN WHILE I WAS DRIVING, AT LEAST NOT IN A WHAT THAT WAS NOTICEABLE.  I WALKED OUT OF WORK AND NOTICED THAT THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAR WAS SITTING A COUPLE INCHES LOWER THAN IT SHOULD.  I TOOK IT TO THE SHOP AND THEY FOUND THAT ONE OF THE COILS OF THE SPRING HAD SNAPPED, CAUSING THE SAGGING.
DRIVING AT 65 MPH ON A 2 LANE HIGHWAY DRY CONDITIONS IN THE EARLY MORNING WHEN I HIT A DEER IN THE FRONT, CAUSING MAJOR DAMAGE AND THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.
LEFT REAR COIL SPRING BROKEN NOT DUE TO HEAVY LOAD OR ROUGH TERRAIN DRIVING VEHICLE ONLY HAS APPROX. 27,000 MILES ON IT .FROM WHAT I'M SEEING ON LINE AND HEARING FROM OTHER OWNERS AND DEALERS, IT IS A PRETTY COMMON PROBLEM.
AC COMPRESSOR WENT AFTER 3 YEARS (WENT AT THE END OF SUMMER LAST YEAR 2017) AND I LIVE IN THE NORTH EAST WHERE WE ONLY USE AC LESS THAN HALF OF THE YEAR.  ALSO REAR SUSPENSION SPRING WENT THIS YEAR.  BOTH OF THESE ISSUES ARE EXTREMELY PREMATURE ON A 2014 MODEL YEAR VEHICLE.  THERE ARE NO GOOD AFTER MARKET OPTIONS FOR EITHER OF THESE PARTS SO HAD TO USE OEM (SUBARU) PARTS.  THE SPRINGS HAVE BEEN RE-ENFORCED WITH A WHITE COATING THAT IS NOT ON THE ORIGINAL AND THEY WERE ON BACK ORDER FOR 3 WEEKS (THAT'S AFTER CALLING ABOUT THE DELAY AND GETTING THEM EXPEDITED)  SHOWING THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THIS PART.  THE SPRINGS BROKE WHILE DRIVING MAKING A VERY LOUD BANG THEN FEELING VERY UNSAFE TO DRIVE.
I HAVE AN ONGOING ISSUE WITH MY 2014 SUBARU FORESTER THAT WAS MANUFACTURED IN 2013, IN WHICH THE CHECK OIL LIGHT ROUTINELY GOES ON APPROXIMATELY HALF-WAY THROUGH A 6K OIL CHANGE.  THERE WAS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST SUBARU THAT STIPULATED AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST COULD BE INITIATED FOLLOWING AN OIL CHANGE.  THE OIL LEVELS ARE CHECKED AT 1,200 MILES AFTER THE OIL CHANGE AND IF THE LEVELS ARE LOW THE VEHICLE WILL FAIL THE TEST AND QUALIFY FOR A NEW ENGINE AT NO COST.     I'VE HAD 2 OIL CONSUMPTION TESTS COMPLETED ON MY CAR, WITH THE FIRST ONE DONE 1 YEAR AGO.  MY VEHICLE PASSED BOTH TESTS AT 1,200 MILES, BUT ROUTINELY IS LOW ON OIL WELL BEFORE MY NEXT SCHEDULED OIL CHANGE.    I HAVE FILED 2 COMPLAINTS WITH SUBARU OF AMERICA WITH NO SUCCESS.  I LAST HAD MY OIL CHANGED AT 71,308 MILES, AND BROUGHT IT BACK FOR THE TEST 1,200 MILES LATER.  I AM NOW 3K INTO THE SAME OIL CHANGE AND MY CHECK OIL LIGHT WENT ON YESTERDAY AND TODAY.  I BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALER TO CHECK THE LEVEL AND IT WAS 3/4 OF A QUART LOW, WHICH SUBARU OF AMERICA SAYS IS NORMAL OIL CONSUMPTION AT 3K INTO AN OIL CHANGE AND THEY WILL NOT REPLACE THE ENGINE.     THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE FOR SUBARU FORESTERS MANUFACTURED IN 2014, AS SUBARU OF AMERICA CHANGED THE PISTONS IN THE ENGINE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE.  I AM VERY STUCK; THE DEALER WON'T HELP ME, SUBARU OF AMERICA WON'T HELP ME, AND THE CAR IS WORTHLESS GIVEN THE SERVICE RECORDS INDICATING THAT IT USES EXCESS OIL.    I WORK FULL-TIME.  I AM ALSO THE MAIN TRANSPORTATION FOR MY 2 YOUNG CHILDREN.  I DRIVE WITH EXTRA QUARTS OF OIL IN MY CAR AND HAVE TO ADD OIL APPROXIMATELY 3-4.5K INTO A 6K OIL CHANGE WHEN THE LIGHT COMES ON.  I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY ON THIS ISSUE WITH NO SUCCESS AND I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE.  I AM HOPING YOU CAN HELP.  I CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH ALL EMAILS TO SUBARU OF AMERICA AND MAINTENANCE RECORDS FOR THE CAR.    UPDATED 11/07/2017*JS
DURING AN OIL CHANGE THIS WEEK. I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS DOWN 1.5 QUARTS. I CALLED THE DEALER AND REQUESTED AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST. THEY DENIED MY APPOINTMENT AND TOLD ME THAT  THIS"WAS THE NEW NORMAL". I DO NOT ACCEPT THAT MY 2014 SUBARU SHOULD BE USING THIS MUCH OIL. I CHECKED THE CLASS ACTION SUBARU OIL CONSUMPTION LAWSUIT, BUT MY VIN NUMBER IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ACTION. I BELIEVE THERE IS STILL A PROBLEM AND THIS NEEDS TO BE FURTHER ADDRESSED.
WHILE CHANGING FROM REVERSE TO DRIVE (FOOT ON BRAKE) THE VEHICLE HESITATES VERY BADLY ESPECIALLY ON A HILL- PRESSING ON THE GAS PEDAL WHEN IN DRIVE DOES NOT MOVE IT FORWARD UNTIL THE HESITATION IS OVER - VERY SCARY. DEALER WAS INFORMED OF THIS SHORTLY AFTER PURCHASE IN DEC 2013 - HE SAID SUBARU WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND WERE WORKING ON A FIX - IS THIS TRUE?
ATTEMPTED TO START  THE  CAR ON A COLD MORNING. BATTERY HAD GOOD CHARGE, BUT CAR WOULD NOT IMMEDIATELY START AS NORMAL.  AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS I PLACED A BATTERY BOOSTER INLINE WITH THE BATTERY, AGAIN AFTER SEVERAL MORE ATTEMPTS NOTHING BUT A FEW SPURTS.. THIS HAPPENED OVER A 20 MINUTE PERIOD. AT NO POINT WAS THERE NOT ENOUGH CRANKING VOLTAGE OR AMPERAGE.  WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE COLD -10, BUT MIND YOU NO COLDER THEN THE 2013 WINTER IN WHICH MANY MANY MORNINGS AND DAYS WHEN THE POLAR VORTEX WAS UPON US DID THE CAR EVER FAIL TO START. THIS IS A 2014 TURBO XT MODEL, IN GENERAL TURBOS ARE HARD STARTERS, AS I RECENTLY OWNED A 2009 ACURA RDX TURBO, BUT AGAIN NEVER HAD STARTING ISSUES WITH THAT CAR. I SPOKE TO MY DEALER , BUT HE OFFERED LITTLE HELP, ALSO CALLED AND CONTACTED SUBARU OF AMERICA, WHO TRIED TO WRITE OF OFF AS A BAD BATTERY, BUT AS I MENTIONED PLENTY OF CRANK, TO DTC'S ERROR, NOTHING , JUST HARD  TO START.. THIS CAR HAS A PROVEN HISTORY OF STARTING IN COLDER WEATHER.  THE CAR HAS EXPERIENCED ROUGH IDLES ON AN OFF, BUT I BELIEVE THERE IS A TSB FOR THIS.  WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THE CAR UNDER THE CONDITIONS SHOULD HAVE STARTED FIRST FEW CRANKS, NOT OVER A DOZEN ATTEMPTS IN A 20 MINUTE PERIOD.  *TR
I PURCHASED MY 2014 FORESTER IN JULY 2013.  I LOVE THE VEHICLE EXCEPT FOR THE DESIGN OF THE CLIMATE CONTROL DIALS WHICH I CONSIDER TO BE A SAFETY HAZARD BECAUSE IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN AT A GLANCE WHAT THE CURRENT SETTING IS FOR EACH FUNCTION (HEAT/AC TEMP, FAN SPEED, FAN DIRECTION.)  STARING AT THE DIAL(S) OR REPEATED GLANCES TAKES THE DRIVER'S ATTENTION OFF THE ROAD FOR TOO LONG, AND THEREFORE IS ABSOLUTELY A SAFETY ISSUE:  EACH ROUND DIAL HAS A RUBBER GRIP SURFACE THAT THE USER CONTACTS. ON THE FRONT FACE OF THE DIAL IS A SHINY CHROME BEZEL RING.  THIS RING IS QUITE NARROW AND HAS 7 SMALL, EQUIDISTANT INDENTATIONS AROUND THE RADIUS. ONE OF THE INDENTATIONS IS YELLOW PLASTIC, WHICH INDICATES THE SETTING.  AT A GLANCE, THE SMALL YELLOW PLASTIC INDICATOR IS VERY DIFFICULT TO LOCATE AMONG THE OTHER SIX INDENTATIONS.  WHAT THE PURPOSE IS OF THE INDENTATIONS IS A MYSTERY (SOME MARKETER WANTED SPARKLE?) AND WHY SUBARU CHOSE PALE YELLOW AGAINST SHINY CHROME MAKES NO SENSE.  I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY ALTERED MY DIALS BY PUTTING A TINY DROP OF WHITE FINGERNAIL POLISH ON THE BLACK RUBBER GRIP DIRECTLY ABOVE EACH YELLOW PLASTIC INDICATOR. NOW, AT A QUICK GLANCE, I CAN EASILY SEE AT WHAT POSITION EACH FUNCTION DIAL IS SET.  IT'S GREAT.  I FEEL MUCH SAFER.  I KNOW THIS SOUNDS LIKE A SMALL, UNIMPORTANT PROBLEM, BUT IT WAS A HUGE CONCERN TO ME.  I HOPE NO FORESTER OWNER IS INVOLVED IN A CRASH BECAUSE HE/SHE TOOK HIS/HER EYES OFF THE ROAD FOR TOO LONG TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ONE OR MORE OF THE CLIMATE CONTROL SETTINGS.  THE FORESTER MIGHT BE A "TOP SAFETY PICK" BUT NOT ON THIS. THANK YOU.  *TR
I am reporting a recurring safety defect in my 2015 Subaru Forester (VIN: [XXX] ) that directly relates to Recall WUM-98 / NHTSA Recall 19V-701 (Occupant Detection System wiring harness).  Original Recall (2019–2020): The Occupant Detection System (ODS) failed, disabling the passenger airbag. Subaru performed the recall remedy at that time.  Reoccurrence (August 2025): The exact same defect reappeared. The SRS airbag warning illuminated and the passenger airbag was disabled while my wife was seated in the passenger seat. Subaru of Lancaster County (PA) initially reported no error, but when I retrieved the car, the warning illuminated immediately.  Repair: On August 28, 2025, the dealer replaced the ODS wiring harness at my expense ($440.73). Since then, the issue has not reappeared.  Concern: This is the same safety defect already subject to Recall WUM-98. I believe the original recall remedy failed to permanently correct the defect, leaving owners vulnerable to reoccurrence and forcing them to pay out-of-pocket for a known recall-related safety failure.  I request NHTSA’s review to determine whether Subaru’s recall remedy is adequate and to ensure owners are not unfairly charged for repeat repairs of the same defect.

My wife’s 2015 Subaru Forester is reported to have a bad rear driver side wheel bearing from our mechanic. She only has 58,464 miles at the time of the incident/ diagnosis. I believe this wheel bearing has prematurely failed. We both drive normally and are not reckless. Please look into the batches/ lot# of the wheel bearings that went into their vehicles around the 2015 models and who makes them. Even multiple manufacturers or mixed batches being installed into new vehicles. They refuse to cover this as our new vehicle warranty has expired.
A small crack appeared mysteriously on the front windshield and has spread - over the past month - where it now covers 1/2 of the windshield. Nothing hit my car, to create the crack or make it spread.   The right air bag light keeps going on and keeps beeping when there is no one sitting in the seat. The only way i can get it to stop is to engage the seat belt - again, even though there is no one in the seat.
The contact owns a 2015 Subaru Forester. The contact stated while driving 40 MPH, the vehicle accelerated at high speed and stability, the traction control, the check engine, and the cruise control warning light illuminated, and the vehicle would not accelerate. The contact turned off and restarted the vehicle and the vehicle operated normally. The vehicle was taken to the dealer, but no failure was found. The contact stated that the failure reoccurred. The vehicle was taken to the dealer and the transmission module was updated, but the failure reoccurred. The vehicle was taken to the dealer and the throttle pedal assembly was replaced multiple times, but the failure persisted. The manufacturer was contacted, and a case was filed. The failure mileage was 73,600.
Our steering wheel clock spring is malfunctioning causing the vehicles horn not to work in certain positions (intermittently).  more of a preventative to warn others, as we first noticed when we tried using it to help warn a car to stop for the light while we were making a left turn the car nearly ran through the red light which would of hit us.  I dont know if the problem has been reproduced but I do see plenty of posts online for the same issue for subarus.  the vehicle has nor component has been inspected by anyone else except myself (owner) nothing gave pre-warning just suddenly stopped working
Suddenly lost acceleration and engine stopped - without any dashboard signal of low gas or engine issue. Car was able to start after couple of minutes.  At the time of losing acceleration and stopping gas indicator was showing two bars - and car was not running with low fuel indicator.  My whole family was in the car and stopping in the middle lane of a busy national highway of 65 miles speed limit on a Saturday late in night was very scary!
While rotating tires two wheel studs sheared off. The lug nuts are always started by hand, tightened (and removed) without an impact tool, and torqued to spec. Took it to a shop for repair. While removing the wheels two more studs sheared off in the shop. Mechanic stated this is a very common problem with Subarus. Google searches verify this. A popular Subaru community website has a thread with 168 posts discussing this issue among 2014-2018 model year Foresters - https://www.subaruforester.org/threads/2014-problem-with-wheel-studs-merged-thread.769466/ - Judging from online content it seems that, at a minimum, hundreds of Subaru owners are experiencing this problem, perhaps thousands. NHTSA and Subaru should investigate this issue and make it right for the many, many owners experiencing the potentially very dangerous problem.  Here are some other existing NHTSA complaints about the same issue:  ===============================  NHTSA ID Number: 11172455  WHILE COMPLETING A TIRE ROTATION, I PLACED THE SPARE TIRE ON THE HUB AS A PLACEHOLDER WHILE I MOVED ON TO OTHER WHEELS.

PREMATURE WHEEL BEARING FAILURE, SUBARU ALREADY HAS A SERVICE BULETIN (#05-70-19 ANNOUNCED ON SEPT 30, 2019) RECOMENDING INSTALLING REVISED BRAKE BACKING PLATES DUE TO FACTORY INSTALLED NON-FLAT BACKING PLATES WHICH DISTORT THE REAR WHEEL BEARINGS/HUBS CAUSING PREMATURE WHEEL BEARING FAILURE.  THIS IS A WELL DOCUMENTED OCCURANCE NOTED ON NATIONAL SUBARU WEB PORTALS FOR MULTIPLE MODELS WITH POSSIBLE CATASTROPHIC OUTCOMES.
This vehicle currently has about 65,000 miles on it.  I have had to replace the battery twice since owning it (new).  The first replacement was at 50283 miles and then again at 57335 miles.  I have recently been made aware that it is alleged that this Subaru model is defective in such a way to precipitate early battery failure.  I want my experience added to that of others.  I have documentation of these two battery replacements which I could supply upon request.
I HAVE CONTINUALLY BEEN HAVING THE SRS LIGHT COMING ON TELLING ME THAT SOMEONE IS SITTING IN MY PASSENGER SEAT WHEN THERE IS NO ON THERE OR WHEN MY 15 YEAR OLD SITS IN THE FRONT SEAT IT DOES NOT REGISTER THAT ANYONE IS SITTING IN THE FRONT SEAT. I TOOK IT TO OUR LOCAL DEALERSHIP AS I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER AND THEY WANT OVER 1600 TO FIX THIS ISSUE
MY HORN IS NOT WORKING UNLESS MY STEERING WHEEL IS TURNED ALL THE WAY TO THE LEFT/RIGHT.  I WAS TOLD IT WAS A CLOCK SPRING IN THE STEERING WHEEL..  THE INTERNET SAID THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM.  I BELIEVE THIS IS BIG SAFETY ISSUE.  WHEN I CALLED SUBARU THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS NO RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE.
KEY GETS STUCK IN IGNITION AFTER THE CAR IS TURNED OFF. CAR WILL START AND   RUN BUT WHEN YOU TURN THE CAR OFF YOU CANNOT REMOVE THE KEY FROM THE IGNITION.   SOMETIMES IT TAKES SEVERAL ATTEMPTS INVOLVING TURNING THE MOTOR BACK ON AND PULLING THE KEY OUT AS I'M TURNING THE MOTOR OFF. IT MAY GO A COUPLE OF DAYS AND BE FINE THEN DO IT SEVERAL TIMES IN A ROW
TL* THE CONTACT OWNED A 2015 SUBARU FORESTER. THE CONTACT STATED THAT A TRUCK RAN A RED LIGHT AND THE CONTACT T-BONED THE TRUCK AT 30 MPH. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE TRUCK FLIPPED AS THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE COLLIDED WITH THE TRUCK. THE CONTACT AND HER PASSENGER WERE INJURED AND HAD TO BE TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL. THE CONTACT'S WRIST AND ARM WERE SORE AND SHE REQUIRED PHYSICAL THERAPY. THE PASSENGER WAS IN A BACK BRACE WITH TWO COMPRESSION FRACTURES IN THE BACK, A FEW BROKEN RIBS, SHE HAD A CONCUSSION, AND A SWOLLEN FOOT AND ANKLE.  A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED. NONE OF THE AIR BAGS DEPLOYED WITH THE FRONTAL COLLISION. THE INSURANCE COMPANY DEEMED THE VEHICLE A TOTAL LOSS. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO A JUNK YARD TO BE INVESTIGATED BY THE MANUFACTURER. THE DEALER HARVEY SUBARU (3351 BENTON RD, BOSSIER CITY, LA 71111 (888) 232-4109) SAID TO CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER. THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED BY THE DEALER THAT THE VIN WAS INCLUDED IN NHTSA RECALL NUMBER: 19V-701000 (AIR BAGS). THE CONTACT WAS UPSET THAT THE RECALL NOTICES WAS NOT RECEIVED UNTIL NOVEMBER OF 2019.  THE CONTACT DID NOT BELIEVE THE MANUFACTURER IN WHY IT TOOK SO LONG TO INVESTIGATE, WHY THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. THE MANUFACTURER JUST RECENTLY SENT AN EMAIL SAYING EVERYTHING WAS FINE. THE CONTACT DID NOT YET RECEIVE A FULL REPORT OF THE INVESTIGATION.  THE VEHICLE WAS CURRENTLY AT A SALVAGE JUNK YARD. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 35,000.
I HAVE HAD AN AIRBAG LIGHT ON IN MY CAR FOR ABOUT 1 YEAR AND I AM PAST WORRIED ABOUT THIS FAULTY AIRBAG THAT MAY NOT DEPLOY IF MY FAMILY IS EVERY IN THE CAR DURING AN ACCIDENT. THERE IS A BEGUN RECALL BUT I HAVE RECIEVED NO NOTICE AND AS IT DESCRIBES IS EXACTLY WHAT DEALERSHIP TOLD ME WAS WRONG 600$ IS THE COST OR THE LIFE OF MY FAMILY... PLEASE RECALL MY AIRBAG SENSOR..
I WAS DRIVING ON CITY STREETS (SPEED LIMIT 45MPH) TO RUN SIMPLE ERRANDS WHEN THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. I IMMEDIATELY TURNED AROUND TO GO HOME WHICH WAS JUST A MINUTE OR TWO AWAY. AS I SAT AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT, I REALIZED THE ENGINE WAS IDLING A BIT ROUGH. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT REMAINED ON. I PARKED THE CAR IN THE GARAGE AND SPOKE WITH SUBARU AS WELL AS OUR MECHANIC AT NEW DIMENSIONS AUTOMOTIVE. APPARENTLY, SUBARU HAD ISSUED A MECHANICS NOTICE TO BE AWARE THAT ALTERNATOR PROBLEMS EXISTED. WE ULTIMATELY HAD THE REPAIR COMPLETED AT NEW DIMENSIONS ON 8/6/19 IN THE AMOUNT OF $877.53. OUR MECHANIC SUGGESTED THAT THIS MECHANICAL ISSUE MAY WELL BECOME A RECALL, AND TO KEEP OUR RECEIPT FOR JUST THAT REASON.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 SUBARU FORESTER. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 70-75 MPH, THE FUEL GAUGE INDICATOR DISPLAYED APPROXIMATELY 50 MILES TO EMPTY AND THE VEHICLE STALLED WITHOUT WARNING. THE CONTACT WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO HARVEY SUBARU (LOCATED AT 3351 BENTON RD, BOSSIER CITY, LA 71111, (888) 232-4109) TO BE DIAGNOSED, BUT THE MECHANIC WAS UNABLE TO RETRIEVE A FAULT CODE OR DUPLICATE THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE FAILURE RECURRED ONCE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 50,000.
FOR THE PAST YEAR, THE PASSENGER AIRBAG HAS BEEN INTERMITTENTLY TURNING OFF AND A WARNING MESSAGE WOULD APPEAR: "SRS AIRBAG SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE CHECKED". MY CAR HAS NEVER BEEN IN ANY KIND OF ACCIDENT AND IS BARELY 4 YEARS OLD. LATELY, IT JUST DOESN'T REALLY WORK AT ALL. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THE AIRBAG SENSOR IS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY AND NEEDS REPLACEMENT. IT IS PART OF THE PASSENGER SEAT. IT'S A $1200 REPAIR BUT WITH MY EXTENDED WARRANTY, I HAVE TO PAY $100 DEDUCTABLE. I AM FLOORED THAT THE AIRBAG SENSOR CAN'T LAST MORE THAN 4 YEARS. THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A HIGHLY RATED CAR FOR SAFETY! I'M VERY DISSATISFIED WITH SUBARU RIGHT NOW.
THE CAR WAS WOBBLY AND WENT IN FOR SERVICE AND THEY FOUND ONE REAR STRUT THE TECHNICIAN TOOK IT FOR A DRIVE AND THE OTHER ONE BROKE ON HIM. IT COSTS ME $1390 TO FIX IT AND I DROVE IT ON THE HIGHWAY AND IT STILL WOBBLY.  SUBARU DOES NOT WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THERE IS A MAJOR ISSUE WITH THIS VEHICLE.  THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECALLED BY SUBARU WHEN THEY KNEW ABOUT THIS.   THIS CAR ALSO HAD ROTORS THAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED, THE ARM CONTROL, WHEEL BEARINGS ALL UNDER 60,000.  THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE, I COULD GET KILLED OR HAVE A MAJOR ACCIDENT AND SUBARU DOES NOT WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT.  I AM SCARED TO DRIVE THIS CAR.    THE CONSUMER STATED THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE AND OFFERED TO ASSIST WITH THE REPAIRS. *JS
THE HORN ON MY 2015 SUBARU FORESTER FAILED TO FUNCTION AT APPROXIMATELY 55,000 MILES.  I DO NOT KNOW SPECIFICS ABOUT THE HORN FAILURE AS I DON'T ROUTINELY USE IT.  APPROXIMATELY 10 DAYS AFTER I LEARNED ABOUT THE HORN, THE RADIO, CLOCK, AND DOOR LOCK REMOTE FEATURE ALSO FAILED TO FUNCTION.    THE SUBARU DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT DIAGNOSED THE HORN PROBLEM AS A FAULTY  STEERING ROLL CONNECTOR (SRC) AND REPLACED THE CONNECTOR.   THE HORN NOW FUNCTIONS.    THE SUBARU SERVICE DEPARTMENT STATED THAT A MISPLACED FUSE (#8 - BACKUP) CAUSED FAILURE OF THE OTHER SYSTEMS.  THEY IMPLIED THAT I HAD MISPLACED THE FUSE - I DID NOT - I CHECKED ONLY THE HORN AND RADIO FUSES.  NO ONE ELSE HAS ACCESS TO MY VEHICLE.    I HAVE LEARNED THAT SUBARU RECALLED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER MODELS OF THEIR VEHICLES IN 2010 DUE TO FAULTY SRCS.  SUSPICIOUSLY, THE SYMPTOMS THEY BLAMED ON MY SUPPOSEDLY MISPLACED FUSE COINCIDE WITH SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FAULTY SRCS IN THE 2010 RECALL.    I AM FILING THIS COMPLAINT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:    A CAR HORN IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SAFETY COMPONENT AND SHOULD NOT BE PRONE TO FAILURE DUE TO A FAULTY CONNECTOR WITHIN THE STEERING WHEEL.  SUBARU SERVICE STATED THEY RARELY ENCOUNTER SRC FAILURE, YET JUST 4 YEARS BEFORE MY VEHICLE WAS MANUFACTURED, THEIR SRCS WERE RECALLED BY THE TENS OF THOUSANDS.    SECONDLY, BLAMING ME FOR FAILURE OF OTHER SYSTEMS THAT ARE DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE STEERING WHEEL (RADIO VOLUME AND TUNING) OR HORN (HORN BEEPS IF YOU PUSH THE LOCK REMOTE 3 TIMES) APPEARS (IN MY OPINION) LIKE AN ATTEMPT TO COVER UP A PROBLEM WITH THE SRC THAT INVOLVES MORE THAN JUST THE HORN - WHICH IS ALREADY ENOUGH TO CAUSE MAJOR SAFETY ISSUES IN ITSELF.      THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO FILE THIS SAFETY COMPLAINT - I HOPE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE IF SUBARU SRCS ARE STILL CAUSING MAJOR ISSUES.
HORN DOES NOT WORK WHEN STERRING WHEEL IN STRAIGHT AHEAD POSITION.  HORN WORKS IN ALL OTHER POSITIONS.
ABOUT 2 WEEKS AGO MY CAR DID SOME BUCKING AND SHUDDERING AND THE TRANSMISSION LIGHT CAME ON WHEN TAKING OFF FROM A STOPPED POSITION SO I  TOOK IT INTO THE  DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID IT NEEDED NEW TRANSMISSION THAT'S GONNA COST $9000 MY VEHICLE DOES HAVE A 150000 MILES ON IT BUT IT'S NEVER BEEN OFF ROAD AND ALL THE MILES ON IT HAVE BEEN HIGHWAY MILES DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE NOT CITY STOP AND GO
PASSENGER SEAT AIRBAG SENSORS MALFUNCTIONED. THIS CAUSED THE AIRBAG TO BE TURNED OFF. THIS HAPPENED WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY. DEALER INDICATED THE SEAT HAS TO BE REPLACED. THE PART IS ON BACK ORDER. THIS INDICATES TO ME THERE IS A WIDE SPREAD PROBLEM.
THIS VEHICLE HAS SHUT DOWN MID-DRIVING ON THE EXPRESSWAY 4 TIMES. THE BATTERY, FUEL SENSORS, FUEL PUMP, AND 'CLUSTER' HAVE BEEN REPLACED. I RECEIVED THE VEHICLE BACK FROM SUBARU SERVICE ON A WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON, AND ON THURSDAY MORNING AS I WAS PULLING OUT OF MY GARAGE THE FUEL GAUGE WAS AGAIN DISPLAYING BLANK EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS MORE THAN A HALF TANK OF GAS IN THE CAR. I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND BACK ON AND THEN EVERY WARNING LIGHT ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL LIGHTED UP. THERE HAVE BEEN 5 REPAIR ATTEMPTS ON THIS VEHICLE AND IT HAS NOT CORRECTED THE ISSUES. THIS VEHICLE IS DEFECTIVE AND DANGEROUS.
AFTER I SLOW DOWN TO TURN A CORNER THIS CAR OCCASIONALLY PAUSES, OR WILL NOT RESUME MOVING FOR A FEW SECONDS WHEN I STEP ON THE GAS. THIS HAS CAUSED CARS BEHIND ME TO ALMOST REAR END ME NUMEROUS TIMES. IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS TWICE IN ONE DAY THEN WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN FOR SEVERAL WEEKS. I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER BUT IT HAS NEVER DONE IT ON ANY OF THEIR TEST DRIVES. THIS HAS OCCURRED EVER SINCE I BOUGHT THIS CAR NEW. I WAS TOLD OTHER OWNERS HAVE COMPLAINED OF THE SAME PROBLEM BUT THEY HAVE TO EXPERIENCE IT WHEN THEY TEST DRIVE IT.
IN AUGUST OF 2015 MY WIFE WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE. ALL DASH LIGHTS CAME ON AND THE VEHICLE BECAME INOPERABLE AS A RESULT. AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS SHE WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE VEHICLE. HOWEVER, AFTER ABOUT 150 FT ALL WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON AGAIN SAYING THAT IS WAS DISABLING SEVERAL SAFETY FEATURES (ABS, EYESIGHT, HILL ASSIST, ETC.). SHE AGAIN PULLED OVER, AND THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT RE-START (FLAT-OUT WOULD NOT COME ON, THE POWER WOULD COME ON BUT THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT START [HAS A KEY LESS IGNITION SYSTEM]). SHE CALLED ROAD SIDE ASSIST AND THEY CAME TO TRY AND HELP HER WITH THE CAR. THEY WERE ABLE TO GET IT STARTED AND SHE DROVE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP. THEY TOOK THE VEHICLE IN AND LOOKED AT IT. THEIR SERVICING NOTES INDICATE THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO REPLICATE THE ISSUE, HOWEVER, WHILE MY WIFE WAS THERE THEY WERE UNABLE TO START THE VEHICLE AS WELL. IN REVIEW OF THESE NOTES THEY INDICATE THE FOLLOWING ERROR CODES WERE PRESENT P1531 AND B2809 AND THEY ALSO REPLACED THE FOLLOWING PART [83311FJ000]. ON JUNE 25, 2017, THE PROBLEM OCCURRED AGAIN WHILE DRIVING. ALL SAFETY FEATURES DISABLED, ALL SYSTEMS SHUT-OFF. ONCE I TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF I WAS UNABLE TO START IT AGAIN. IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS UNABLE TO DEPRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL FAR ENOUGH TO TRIGGER THE KEYLESS START FEATURE. SO, THE VEHICLE WAS UNUSABLE AND UNSAFE. I CONTACTED SUBARU AND THEY HAVE TOWED THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP AS ALL ATTEMPTS TO START THE VEHICLE HAVE FAILED (ALL POWER WORKS, BUT NO START AND ALL SAFETY FEATURES INDICATE THEY ARE DISABLED). I SPOKE WITH THE DEALERSHIP AND EXPRESSED ALL OF THESE CONCERNS AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHERS. THE VEHICLE IS AT THE DEALERSHIP AT THIS TIME. IN ALL INSTANCES WHEN THE VEHICLE HAD ISSUES WE WERE EITHER DRIVING ON A CITY STREET, A LOCAL HIGHWAY, OR UNABLE TO START THE VEHICLE DUE TO THESE PROBLEMS. THIS IS THE SECOND OCCURRENCE IN LESS THAN THREE YEARS.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2015 SUBARU FORESTER. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE LOST POWER WHILE DRIVING VARIOUS SPEEDS. THE CHECK ENGINE WARNING INDICATOR ILLUMINATED WHEN THE FAILURE OCCURRED. THE DEALER DIAGNOSED THAT THE THROTTLE BODY AND BRAKE SENSORS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 37,000.
CAR WAS IN PARK.  LEFT RUNNING TO COME BACK & GET SOMETHING IN HOUSE.  WHEN WENT BACK TO CAR, OPENED DOOR & VEHICLE STARTED ROLLING BACKWARDS.  BY TIME I WAS ABLE GET IN, THE CAR ROLLED IN DITCH & DAMAGED DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR. HAPPENED IN A MATTER OF 3 MINUTES TOPS.  BOTTOM OF DRIVER'S DOOR WAS FOULED IN ON SIDE OF BANK.
I'VE NOTICED I RUN EXTREMELY LOW ON OIL AT ABOUT 1,500 MILES BEFORE MY SCHEDULED OIL CHANGE. I'VE BEEN ADDING A QUART AT EVERY 5,000 AS TO NOT RUN DRY AND DAMAGE THE ENGINE. I MOSTLY DRIVE HIGHWAY MILES AND STARTING HAVING THIS ISSUE AT 30,000 MILES.
WHILE DRIVING EASTBOUND ON I-80 IN IOWA JUST EAST OF EXIT 220 (WILLIAMSBURG) OUR CAR LOST POWER BUT, BECAUSE IT HAS A MANUAL TRANSMISSION, I WAS ABLE TO DEPRESS THE CLUTCH AND COAST TO THE LEFT ROAD MARGIN.  THE LOW FUEL INDICATOR HAD COME ON A FEW MILES BEFORE BUT THE DISPLAY INDICATOR SHOWED THAT WE HAD SUFFICIENT FUEL TO DRIVE 60 MILES AT THE DISPLAYED AVERAGE OF 30.5 MILES PER GALLON.  THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN CORRECT AS THE MANUAL STATES THAT WHEN THE LOW FUEL INDICATOR COMES THERE ARE 2.6 GALLONS REMAINING.  I TRIED TO RESTART THE CAR AS THE INDICATOR CONTINUED TO SHOW ONE INCREMENT IN THE GAS GAUGE AND A RANGE OF 60 MILES ON THE DISPLAY.  AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS IT WAS APPARENT THAT THE ENGINE WAS NOT GETTING FUEL.  WE EVENTUALLY WERE ASSISTED BY AN IOWA STATE PATROL OFFICER WHO TOOK ME BACK TO THE CASEY'S STATION IN WILLIAMSBURG WHERE I BOUGHT A GASOLINE CAN AND ABOUT 3.5 GALLONS OF FUEL.  WITH HIS ASSISTANCE I WAS ABLE TO FUEL MY CAR (THE TRAFFIC AT THAT TIME AND PLACE WAS VERY HEAVY AND FAST), AND THE CAR STARTED IMMEDIATELY.  IT IS BE IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE LOW FUEL INDICATOR DID NOT COME ON AFTER I STARTED THE CAR.  I HAD NOT PUT ALL OF THE GAS IN THE CAN INTO MY CAR, AND THE MANUAL STATES THAT THE INDICATOR WILL NOT COME ON WHEN THE TANK IS HOLDING 4.5 GALLONS OF FUEL, SO THERE WAS CLEARLY A GALLON OR MORE OF FUEL IN THE TANK WHEN IT DIED.  ALSO, THAT SECTION OF EASTBOUND I-80 IS SLIGHTLY UPHILL.  IT SEEMS THEN THAT EITHER THE ELECTRONICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE READING FUEL LEVELS ARE VERY INACCURATE, OR THE GAS TANK IS BUILT IN SUCH A WAY THAT WHEN THE TANK IS LOWER ON FUEL AND GOING UPHILL GAS IS NOT GETTING TO THE ENGINE.  HAD I NOT BEEN DRIVING A MANUAL TRANSMISSION AND ABLE TO ROLL ONTO THE MARGIN UPHILL BUT SIMPLY SLOWED TO A SUDDEN STOP IN THAT TRAFFIC WHEN THE ENGINE DIED, I BELIEVE IT WOULD HAVE CAUSED A VERY SERIOUS SERIES IF COLLISIONS.
TIRE PRESSURE MONITOR INDICATED LOW PRESSURE. RIGHT REAR TIRE NEEDED AIR. TIRE CONTINUED TO SLOWLY LEAK AND THE PRESSURE MONITOR TRIPPED AGAIN DAYS LATER. MENTIONED PROBLEM TO DEALERSHIP DURING SERVICE. DEALERSHIP FOUND NO PROBLEM WITH THE TIRE AND PROPERLY INFLATED ALL WHEELS. A FEW DAYS LATER THE TIRE PRESSURE WAS LOW (TIRE PRESSURE MONITOR TRIPPED AGAIN). BRINGING VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALER FOR POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT OF TIRE.    PROBABLY A PROBLEM ISOLATED TO MY SPECIFIC CAR, BUT LOGGING THE INCIDENT IN CASE THERE ARE MORE TIRES OUT THERE WITH SIMILAR PROBLEMS.  *TR
THIS VEHICLE IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE SINCE SUBARU COULD NOT REPLICATE THE ORIGINAL OVERHEATING PROBLEM IN THE TRANSMISSION. THEY MADE AN EDUCATED GUESS REPAIR  TO SEE IF IT FIXES THE OVERHEATING PROBLEMS IN THE TRANSMISSION WHICH MAY MALFUNCTION DURING DRIVING THE VEHICLE,SLIPPAGE, TO LOCKINGUP.   This afternoon, while my daughter was driving through the Mojave Desert on her way back home to Mammoth Lakes, Ca.;  her dash light came on- AT OIL TEMP Warning, forcing multiple stops to cool the vehicle. The trip back to Hacienda Heights took over four hours (4) in extreme heat. I’ve attached a photo of the dash warning for your reference. After she called me from the road, I instructed her to turn around and wait for the warning light to turn off. (Google’s guidance  emphasized cooling the transmission before resuming travel). Thankfully, the route [XXX]  from Mojave was mostly downhill, which helped reduce strain on the vehicle—but it was still a stressful and exhausting experience.  MY LETTER SUBARU  I need to be candid: my time and patience are wearing thin. I’ve remained cooperative throughout this process and paid about $644 out-of-pocket for repairs specifically recommended by Ocean Subaru—including the initial solenoid replacement, CVT oil cooler, and thermostat. While I appreciate that the remaining repairs were performed under goodwill, the original overheating issue remains unresolved, and its root cause is still uncertain. SUBARU HASN'T REPAIRED THE PROBLEM. S Regarding future repairs or services, we cannot guarantee coverage until the details of any needed repairs are identified and thoroughly reviewed.     If there are any updates or if further repairs are recommended, please feel free to let me know in a direct reply, and I will do my best to assist you.  Thank you again for your understanding and patience.   Sincerely,  Michael Subaru of America, Inc.

Passenger's seat belt sensor is alarming when no one is in the seat.  The passenger side airbag warning light is also coming on and off.  I took it to the dealer, and they confirmed that the sensor in the seat pad is bad.  The airbag light was intermittently going on for several weeks before I took it in.    The car has been at the dealer since mid-August, and I am told that the part is currently on backorder without an estimated arrival date.
The contact owns a 2016 Subaru Forester. The contact stated that while parking the vehicle and shifting into park with the brake pedal depressed, the vehicle suddenly jerked forward and drove over the curb. The vehicle came to a stop after striking a fence. The contact stated that there were no warning lights illuminated. No injuries were reported. The vehicle was driven to the residence. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The local dealer was not made aware of the failure. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 73,000.
With car engine running and adult sitting in passemger seat, the passenger airbag on-off orange warning light will flicker between "on" and "off".
The battery drains constantly. I’ve had it replaced several times but it continues to die even when I jump it repeatedly.  This may be a known issue but the Subaru dealership’s tech refused to admit their car’s electrical system caused the issue and attempted to have me continue to drive with a dead battery, then have AAA replace the battery under the AAA warranty (even though Subaru’s car was at fault, not AAA’s battery), which was really disingenuous.   At the dealership, I was told that if I chose to have Subaru replace the battery (as they should given it has a class action settlement and has an extended warranty) I “may never get paid” if I submitted a class action lawsuit claim.    My car has died multiple times, inconveniencing me again and again, even at gas stations. The way Subaru is handling their electrical system error is not professional at all.
The contact owns a 2016 Subaru Forester. The contact stated while driving approximately 80 MPH, the vehicle lost motive power. There were unknown warning lights illuminated. The contact was able to pull over safely and restart the vehicle. The failure reoccurred several times. The vehicle was taken to the local dealer and diagnosed; however, the cause of the failure was not determined. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 70,000.
The contact owns a 2016 Subaru Forester. The contact stated that while driving at an unknown speed, there was a loud humming noise coming from the vehicle. The vehicle was taken to the dealer where it was diagnosed that the rear wheel bearing failed but the contact was unaware which wheel needed to be repaired. The vehicle was repaired but years later the failure recurred. The vehicle was taken back to the dealer where it was diagnosed that both rear wheels bearings failed and needed to be replaced. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 60,050.
Battery seems to drain for no reason very frequently.
VEHICLE STALLED IN INTERSECTION. CAR HAS A ROUGH IDLE, THIS IS THE SECOND TIME IT HAS STALLED. DEALERSHIP HAS LOOKED AT THE CAR BUT NOT RESOLVED THE ISSUE.
WHILE THE VEHICLE IS STATIONARY, THE KEY GETS STUCK IN THE IGNITION WHEN ATTEMPTING TO TURN THE CAR OFF.  THE MOTOR SHUTS DOWN, BUT THE KEY WILL NOT TURN COMPLETELY TO THE REMOVAL LOCATION.  I OFTEN HAVE TO TURN THE VEHICLE ON AND THEN QUICKLY OFF IN ORDER TO GET THE KEY TO REMOVE FROM THE IGNITION.  SOMETIMES PUTTING THE VEHICLE BACK INTO GEAR (REVERSE OR DRIVE) BEFORE RETURNING THE TRANSMISSION TO PARK IS ALSO REQUIRED.  SEVERAL ATTEMPTS MAY BE NECESSARY BEFORE SUCCESSFULLY REMOVING THE KEY FROM THE IGNITION.  THIS PROBLEM STARTED SUDDENLY IN THE LAST MONTH AND OCCURS AT LEAST 50% OF THE TIME WHEN THE VEHICLE IS USED.
MY FORESTER ACCELERATES WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE. THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES WHEN I STOP AT LIGHT AND ADVANCE IT SOMETIMES ACCELERATES MORE THAN I HAVE PRESSED ON GAS.  *TR
2016 SUBARU FORESTER. CONSUMER WRITES IN REGARDS TO FRONT PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG SAFETY RECALL. *LD    THE CONSUMER STATED THE MANUFACTURER EXCEEDED A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME COMPLETING THE RECALL REPAIR.  *JS
UNABLE TO REMOVE THE KEY FROM THE IGNITION SWITCH WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN PARK AND THE CAR IS STATIONARY. PER TSP 16 112 18R THE CAUSE IS CONTAMINATION OF THE PARK-RANGE SWITCH INTERNAL COMPONENTS. WE OWN 2 IDENTICAL CARS PURCHASED THE SAME DAY. BOTH HAVE STARTED TO EXPERIENCE THIS EVERY DAY SINCE WE HIT 30,000 MILES. WE PURCHASED IN APRIL 2016, SO WARRANTY NO LONGER COVERS. THERE ARE HUNDREDS (MAYBE THOUSANDS) OF POSTINGS ON MANY FORUMS INDICATING THE SAME ISSUE. THIS HAS RESULTED IN US HAVING TO LEAVE THE KEY IN THE CAR WHEN WE PARK SOMEWHERE. IT TAKES AROUND 3-4 MINUTES TO START AND RESTART THE CAR AND MOVE IT BACK AND FORTH IN ORDER TO RELEASE THE KEY. THIS IS NOT THE SITUATION THAT OCCURS WHEN YOU JUST NEED TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL.
FRONT PASSENGER AIR BAG SENSORS ERRATICALLY REPORT A MALFUNCTION AND SUGGEST AN INSPECTION.  THIS HAS HAPPENED BOTH WHEN VEHICLE IS IN MOTION AS WELL AS STATIONARY. IT HAS HAPPENED BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT A FRONT SEAT OCCUPANT.  I CALLED SUBARU AMERICA AND BROUGHT THE CAR INTO NAPLETON SUBARU ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, IL ON JULY 24, 2019. ON THAT DATE I COULD NOT RECREATE THE ERROR MESSAGES.  NAPLETON INSPECTED AND TOLD ME SYSTEM NEEDED A RESET WHICH THEY DID FREE OF CHARGE.  SINCE THERE WAS NO ERROR MESSAGE EITHER IMMEDIATELY BEFORE OR AFTER THE VISIT, I HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER RESET WAS EFFECTIVE.  THE NEXT DAY THE ERROR MESSAGE WAS BACK.  PICTURES ATTACHED AS WELL AS RECEIPT FROM NAPLETON DESCRIBING WORK PERFORMED. *TT  CONSUMER STATED VEHICLE WAS TAKEN INTO THE DEALER TWICE AND IS CURRENTLY WORKING PROPERLY, BUT CANNOT DETERMINE WHETHER THE  AIR BAG ERROR MESSAGE HAS BEEN FALSELY ACTIVATED. OR IF THERE IS A REAL MALFUNCTION.*JB
TL* THE CONTACT OWNED A 2016 SUBARU FORESTER. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN PARKED FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES BEFORE THE NEIGHBOR NOTICED FLAMES COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD OF THE VEHICLE. MOMENTS LATER, THE VEHICLE WAS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. THE NEARBY MOTOR HOME AND HOUSE ALSO CAUGHT ON FIRE AND WERE DESTROYED ALONG WITH THE VEHICLE. THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS NOT DETERMINED. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED TO THE SCENE TO EXTINGUISH THE FLAMES. THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS NOT DETERMINED. THE LOCAL DEALER WAS NOT NOTIFIED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS INFORMED OF THE FAILURE. THE VIN WAS NOT AVAILABLE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 45,000.
I HAVE HAD VERY SIMILAR ISSUES TO THE GENTLEMAN WHOSE NHTSA # IS 11161972. ON THREE OCCASIONS WHEN I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AT APPROXIMATELY 70 MILES AN HOUR AND USUALLY GOING UP AND INCLINE, MY ENGINE WOULD SPUTTER AND THE CAR WOULD DIE.   ALL THREE TIMES MY CAR SCREEN SHOWED THAT I HAD BETWEEN 60 AND 80 MILES LEFT IN MY TANK AND MY FUEL GAUGE WHICH SHOW TWO CLICKS TO THE RIGHT OF EMPTY. THE FIRST TIME I THOUGHT IT COULD BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT I NEEDED GAS IN MY CAR . AT THAT POINT I CONTACTED AAA AND THEY BROUGHT ME 2 GALLONS OF GAS TO GET ME TO THE NEXT EXIT TO SO THAT I CAN FILL MY TANK. THE SECOND  TIME I HAD MOVED OVER TO THE EMERGENCY LANE  AS MY CAR WAS DYING. I HAD WAITED ABOUT 10 MINUTES WHILE I WAS WAITING ON AAA AGAIN TO SHOW UP WHEN I DECIDED TO START MY CAR AND THE ENGINE STARTED. I WAS LITERALLY 2/10 OF A MILE FROM THE GAS STATION SO I HEADED IN THAT DIRECTION TO FILL MY TANK. THE THIRD TIME AS I WAS INCLINING ON A HILL  IN THE FAST LANE, THE ENGINE SUDDENLY DIED AS I WAS DRIVING ABOUT 70 MILES AN HOUR. FORTUNATELY I THOUGHT FAST AND HIT THE EMERGENCY FLASHERS AS I HAD A SEMI RIGHT BEHIND MY CAR. THIS TIME I MOVED OVER INTO THE LEFT SIDE EMERGENCY LANE AND WAITED ABOUT 10 MINUTES AND MY CAR STARTED AGAIN. THIS SEEMS TO ALWAYS HAPPEN WHEN THE CAR IS SHOWING BETWEEN 60 AND 90 MILES OF GAS LEFT IN MY TANK AND ALWAYS WITH TWO CLICKS ON THE FULL GAGE. I AM NOT SURE AS TO WHY THIS IS HAPPENING AND HAVE TAKEN IT TO MY SUBARU DEALERSHIP AND THEY ARE UNAWARE OF ANY PROBLEMS YET WE'RE UNABLE TO RE-CREATE THE PROBLEM WHEN THEY TRIED TO DRIVE IT. AS SOMEONE WHO PUTS A LOT OF ROAD MILES ON THEIR CAR FOR WORK, THIS IS A LITTLE BIT SCARY AS MY TRAVELS  ARE ON THE HIGHWAY AND NOT ALWAYS IN LARGE CITIES.  ONE THING THAT I HAVE NOTICED IS THAT THE VIN NUMBER ON NHTSA TICKET # 11161972 MATCHES MINE EXACTLY BASED ON WHAT IS SHOWN ON YOUR SITE.  ALL HWY DRIVING.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2016 SUBARU FORESTER. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE VEHICLE ACCELERATED UNEXPECTEDLY AND CRASHED INTO A FENCE ON OCTOBER 24, 2017. THERE WERE NO WARNING INDICATORS ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC. THE LOCAL DEALER WAS NOT CONTACTED THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THERE WERE NO INJURIES. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS UNKNOWN. ON JULY 18, 2018, WHILE DRIVING AT AN UNKNOWN SPEED, THE VEHICLE ACCELERATED AGAIN AND CRASHED INTO A SECURITY POLE. THERE WERE NO WARNING INDICATORS ILLUMINATED. A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED AND THERE WERE NO INJURIES. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC. THE LOCAL DEALER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED AND REFERRED THE CONTACT TO THE LOCAL DEALER. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 20,000.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2016 SUBARU FORESTER. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 70 MPH, THE VEHICLE'S POWER SEIZED. THERE WERE NO WARNING INDICATORS ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO FITZGERALD TOYOTA (907 N FREDERICK AVE, GAITHERSBURG, MD 20879) WHERE THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS UNKNOWN.
CAR HAS 15000 MILES-USES ONE QUART OF OIL EVERY 2000 MILES-THIS MUCH OIL CONSUMPTION INDICATES A SERIOUS PROBLEM. CAR WAS PURCHASED ON 03/05/2016.
EYESIGHT SYSTEM DID NOT PICK UP VEHICLE IN FROMT OF CAR AND PROCEED TO DRIVE STRAIGHT TOWARD AT 70MPH, I HAD TO BRAKE THE CAR. THIS HAPPENED TWICE IN ONE DAY. DEALER SAID THEY TESTED CAR AND SYSTEM WAS WORKING FINE. THE SYSTEM DID NOT DETECT THE LARGE VEHICLE IN FRONT.
See attached document for complaint.
The contact owns a 2017 Subaru Forester.  The contact stated while driving at an undisclosed speed, the check engine warning light illuminated, and several safety features failed to function as intended. In addition, the contact stated that the check engine warning light had been illuminated intermittently for over a month prior to a diagnostic test. The vehicle was taken to the dealer where DTC code: P0420 was retrieved, and the vehicle was diagnosed with catalytic converter failure. The contact was informed that the catalytic converter needed to be replaced. The vehicle was scheduled to be repaired. The contact researched Warranty Extension: 09-84-22; however, the contact was informed that the repair was not covered under any warranty programs. In addition, the contact stated that the case manager provided false information and stated that the Warranty Extension document did not exist. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure and a case was filed. The failure mileage was approximately 140,000.
The contact owned a 2017 Subaru Forester. The contact stated that while attempting to make a left turn at an intersection, the contact observed there was a vehicle coming towards the intersection at high speeds. The contact stated that the stop light was green, however, the contact stopped the vehicle, and the vehicle coming towards the contact, depressed the brake pedal causing the vehicle to swerve and crash into the contact's vehicle on the front passenger's side at approximately 50 MPH. The contact stated that the vehicle spun around about 90 degrees. The air bags did not deploy, and no warning lights were illuminated. The contact sustained severe whiplash causing a concussion, crushed disc, ruptured at least 1 vertebrae, and spinal column nerve damage. The contact had been receiving medical treatment since the accident. The vehicle was towed to the tow company's storage lot. A police report was filed. The insurance company determined that the vehicle was a total loss. The other driver sustained severe burns when the air bags deployed.  The contact was informed that the vehicle was in dealer mode, which did not allow warning lights to illuminate the vehicle. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 97,000.
The contact owns a 2017 Subaru Forester. The contact stated while driving at approximately 35 MPH, the passenger’s side air bag sensor showed that there was no passenger in the seat. The contact stated on other occasions while there was a passenger seated in the seat, the occupant detection system failed to detect a passenger seated in the seat. The contact stated that the failure was intermittent but recurred several times. The contact had taken the vehicle to a local dealer, where it was diagnosed and determined that the passenger’s air bag sensor needed to be replaced; however, the contact was advised that the sensors were on a national backorder. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer had been informed of the failure and advised the contact that the sensors were on backorder. The contact was recently advised that he would have to take the vehicle back and return the loaner vehicle to the dealer. The contact was advised by the dealer not to have a passenger sit in the front passenger’s seat until the air bag sensor was replaced. The failure mileage was approximately 75,000.
The windshield has failed without the vehicle suffering any collisions. The failure has led to the epoxy attaching the rear view mirror to detach with the glass from the windshield. Not only does the rear view mirror now hang from the electrical wire, the epoxy was able to remove a chunk of the glass.   This has led to a significant safety issue as I’m unable to use my rear view mirror to no fault of my own.   It is available for inspection. No dealer or further inspection with my insurance company has occurred.
Exhaust fumes noticed in the passenger cabin of the vehicle.  PZEV equipped. I have heard of others experiencing the same issue.  This was noted some time ago, however parts were not available at the time and Subaru N.A. had not responded to my written correspondance until i finally phoned them.  Very concerned about potential for Carbon Monoxide.  I understandf Ford explorer and VW had similar issues.  The attached estimate was recently obtained from the dealership but service rep claimed this was the recommended service at time of discovery.
We have had issues with the battery draining since early on in owning the car. First the power windows stopped working and they replaced the battery. We are now having more battery issues and the care is in the shop.
The exhaust pipe assembly for our 2017 non-turbo Subaru Forester has failed.  Two other similar complaints for this model and year vehicle have been submitted to NHTSA (ID#’s 11429564 and 11395158).  Exhaust fumes spread within the vehicle cabin and presents a significant safety and health issue for occupants.  A similar problem has been reported for turbo charge vehicles for which Subaru issued a voluntary emissions recall on March 27, 2020.  No such recall for non-turbo vehicles has been issued by Subaru.   The vehicle will be inspected by the local dealer.  I request NHTSA investigate this issue and request Subaru expand its voluntary emissions recall to non-turbo vehicles.
The contact owns a 2017 Subaru Forester. The contact stated that while driving approximately 35 mph the vehicle crashed into a second vehicle causing substantial front end damage to the vehicle. During the crash no airbags in the vehicle deployed. The driver sustained chest and rib injuries and was transported to the hospital. A police report was taken at the scene and the vehicle was towed away. The cause of the failure was not determined. The manufacturer and local dealer were not yet notified. The failure mileage was 33,000.
Since purchasing this vehicle in October, 2016, I have purchased two new batteries. It continues to die with no apparent reason. Even with a new battery that was installed this past spring, it died again on July 5th.  Yes, it is available for inspection.  Nobody was at risk.  The mechanic who works on my car checked the battery before he replaced it a second time. He said there was nothing wrong with it; then, when he changed the oil and did some routine maintenance, it died. He replaced it a second time. This was in the spring.  There were no warnings. I need to reset the automatic window feature each time this happens. I do not understand why the battery continues to be a problem. I have had to get it jumped multiple times, both in my garage as well as the parking lot at work.
BATTERY GOES DEAD AND MUST BE REPLACED IF NOT DRIVEN FOR SEVERAL DAYS.  I HAVE REPLACED THE BATTERY TWICE.
WHEN YOU SHUT THE ENGINE OFF YOU CAN'T TAKE THE KEYS OUT OFF THE IGNITION.
MY WINDSHIELD DEVELOPED A LARGE CRACK (2 FEET LONG) BEGINNING AT THE LOWER LEFT EDGE OF THE WINDSHIELD BELOW THE WIPER EXTENDING HALF WAY UP THE WINDSHIELD. THERE HAD BEEN NO IMPACTS TO THE WINDSHIELD TO EXPLAIN THE CRACK, AND THE ORIGIN OF THE CRACK DID NOT CONTAIN A CHIP TO SHOW WHY IT STARTED. I NOTICED THE CRACK WHEN I PARKED AT MY HOUSE, I'M NOT SURE WHEN IT STARTED BUT WAS SURE IT WASN'T PRESENT WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE 2.5 WEEKS PREVIOUSLY.
HAVE A 2017 FORESTER. AT LEAST A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK, THE KEY GET STUCK IN THE IGNITION. YOU CAN TURN THE CAR OFF, BUT YOU CAN'T REMOVE THE KEY. IF I START THE CAR BACK UP, AND SHIFT IT INTO DRIVE, AND THEM SLAM IT BACK INTO PARK, THEN I CAN TURN THE CAR OFF AND REMOVE THE KEY
I JUST PURCHASED MY 2017 SUBARU FORESTER ON 6/13/20 AND WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY ON 6/25/20 THE WINDSHIELD WAS HIT BY A SMALL ROCK FROM A SEMI TRUCK IN FRONT OF ME. I DID NOT SEE ANY VISIBLE DAMAGE AT THE TIME BUT THE NEXT DAY A VERY LARGE CRACK APPEARED ON MY WINDSHIELD ALMOST A FOOT AND A HALF LONG. IN SPEAKING WITH OTHER SUBARU OWNERS I HAD NOT REALIZED WHAT A MASSIVE AND WELL KNOWN ISSUE THIS IS FOR SUBARU WINDSHIELDS. I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS TYPE OF DAMAGE OCCUR THIS INSTANTLY ON A WINDSHIELD FROM SUCH A MINOR IMPACT.  *TR
WINDSHIELD IS HORRIBLY CHIPPED AND HAS ONE CRACK WITH LESS THAN 50,000 MILES. WILL NEED NEW WINDSHIELD SOON DUE TO HOW UNSAFE IT IS WHEN SUN HITS IT.
MY WINDSHIELD DEVELOPED A CRACK FOR NO APPARENT REASON AND I HAD TO REPLACE IT.
THE WINDSHIELD CRACKED ALONG THE TOP CENTER  WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE OF BEING HIT BY ANYTHING. THE SUBARU DEALER ARRANGED FOR A THIRD PARTY TO REPLACE THE WINDSHIELD AT MY EXPENSE AND THEN CHARGED ME $360 TO READJUST THE SAFETY VISION THROUGH THE NEW WINDSHIELD. THIS WAS DONE THROUGH MY INSURANCE WHICH CAUSED MY INSURANCE TO GO UP. AT NO TIME DID ANYONE TELL ME THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS OF THESE WINDSHIELDS BREAKING SPONTANEOUSLY BECAUSE THEY ARE DEFECTIVE.  I HAVE THE SERVICE INVOICE FROM 16 APRIL 2019.
I AM REPORTING TO SEPARATE INCIDENCES. BOTH INCIDENCES ARE BECAUSE OF A SMALL ROCK HITTING MY WINDSHIELD, CREATING A BULLET-SIZED CRACK IN MY WINDSHIELD. ONE OCCURRED WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AND ONE OCCURRED WHILE DRIVING ON COUNTY ROADS. THE FIRST BULLET HOLE CRACK HAS SINCE SPREAD INTO A CRACK THAT COVERS THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF MY WINDSHIELD PERIOD THE MORE RECENT BULLET HOLE CRACK WILL MOST LIKELY DO THE SAME.
I UNDERSTAND THE NHTSA IS INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE PASSENGER AIRBAG DEFECTS IN 2016-2018 SUBARU FORESTERS.  THE PASSENGER AIRBAG SENSOR IN OUR 2017 FORESTER IS NOT WORKING ON A CONSISTENT BASIS AND HAS BEEN DEFECTIVE SINCE WE BOUGHT THE CAR..  MY WIFE NEEDS A SEAT CUSHION FOR HER BAD BACK AND MANY TIMES, WHEN MY WIFE SITS IN THE SEAT,  THE AIR BAG STAYS IN THE "OFF" STATUS.  WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE SAME ISSUE COMES UP WHEN SHE DOES NOT USE THE CUSHION. ALSO,  WHEN SHE IS WEARING A WINTER COAT AND NOT USING HER CUSHION, THE SENSOR STAYS IN THE "AIRBAG OFF" POSITION. ALSO, WE FIND THAT THE AIR BAG STAYS "OFF" IF THE CAR IS RUNNING BEFORE SHE GETS INTO THE SEAT.  IF SHE GETS INTO THE SEAT BEFORE THE CAR IS TURNED ON, WE FIND THAT THE AIRBAG SENSOR SEEMS TO WORK (NOT ALWAYS, BUT SOME OF THE TIME).  THE DEALER HAS LOOKED AT THIS ISSUE SEVERAL TIMES AND CANNOT FIX THE SENSOR.  I UNDERSTAND THAT THE SENSOR IS IN THE LOWER SEAT BACK AND NOT IN THE FLAT PART OF THE SEAT SO MY WIFE NEEDS TO ADJUST HER SITTING POSTURE FOR 5-10 MINUTES BEFORE THE AIRBAG "OFF" LIGHT GOES OFF.  MY WIFE DOES NOT HAVE ANY ISSUES WHEN SHE IS DRIVING WITH HER SEAT CUSHION - WE ASSUME THE DRIVERS AIRBAG IS ALWAYS ON. ONCE WE ARE MOVING AND THE "OFF" LIGHT IS GONE, WE HAVE NO ISSUES WHILE DRIVING UNTIL THE NEXT TIME THE CAR IS TURNED OFF/ON. AGAIN - SOMETIMES IT WORKS -- SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T.  NOT SAFE !!! *DT  THE CONSUMER STATED THE VEHICLE HAS YET TO BE REPAIRED. *TR
USUALLY WHILE DRIVING, THE PASSENGER AIRBAG SENSOR WILL TURN OFF AND PUT AN ERROR CODE OUT THAT SAYS NOT ON EVEN WITH AN ADULT IN THE SEAT.  RESETTING THE CODE CAN GET IT TO GO OFF BUT IT RETURNS.  HAS TURNED OFF ON ITS OWN BEFORE AND COME BACK.  TURNING CAR OFF AND ON DOES NOT RESET IT. *DT *DT  *AS
SRS AIRBAG LIGHT CAME ON WHILE DRIVING WITH A PASSENGER IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT.  AT THE SAME TIME, THE PASSENGER AIRBAG TURNED OFF.  THIS HAPPENED TWICE, 4 DAYS APART.  TOOK CAR TO THE DEALER AND THEY TOLD ME THE SENSOR MUST HAVE GOTTEN WET.  I DON'T BELIEVE THE SENSOR WAS EVER WET.  HAPPEN AGAIN TWICE IN THE NEXT 2 WEEKS WHILE DRIVING.  I HAD ALSO PREVIOUSLY HAD THE PASSENGER SEATBELT LIKE COME ON WHEN THERE WAS NO PASSENGER IN THE SEAT WHILE DRIVING.  WENT BACK TO THE DEALER AND THEY REPLACE THE PASSENGER SEAT DUE TO A BAD SENSOR.
THE WINDSHIELD ON MY VEHICLE DEVELOPED DOZENS OF CHIPS AFTER ONLY 40K MILES OF DRIVING.  MY PREVIOUS VEHICLES DRIVEN IN THE SAME MANNER IN THE SAME PLACES HAD NO SUCH PROBLEM.  THE OTHER THE DAY FACTORY WINDSHIELD DEVELOPED A LARGE CRACK AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.  PLEASE LOOK AT OTHER OWNER COMPLAINTS AT SUBARUFORESTER.ORG ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE FORESTER WINDSHIELD.  THERE IS A TREND OF BROKEN WINDSHIELDS ON THIS MODEL.  THIS IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE THAT SUBARU NEEDS TO RESOLVE.  THE FACTORY WINDSHIELD IS TOO WEAK.
WINDSHIELD CRACKS AT VERY LITTLE IMPACT AND CRACKS SPREAD RAPIDLY THROUGH WINDSHIELD. I HAD WINDSHIELD REPLACEMENT TWICE IN 2018 AND IT CRACKED AGAIN ON 01-01-2019.  IT HAPPENED ON THE SAME ROAD I COMMUTE FOR 20 YEARS AND NEVER HAD WINDSHIELD CRACKS WITH MY PREVIOUS VEHICLES.
29 JUNE WIFE AND I ARE ON THE HIGHWAY DRIVING WHEN THE PASSENGER AIRBAG LIGHT GOES TO OFF AND THE FAULT CODE APPEARS ON THE HEADS UP DISPLAY TELL US TO TAKE INTO SERVICE IMMEDIATELY. WELL WE CAR OFF AND WE DON'T HEAR ANYTHING BACK FOR A FEW DAYS. WE CALLED THEM BACK ON THE 5TH OF JULY BECAUSE OF THE HOLLIDAY. THEY TOLD MY WIFE ON THE PHONE THEY WERE GOING TO REPLACE SEAT CUSHION BECAUSE THAT SEEMED TO BE THE ISSUE. FAST FORWARD TO 9 JULY MY WIFE RECIEVES A CALL TELLING HER THE CAR IS READY FOR PICKUP. MY WIFE ASKS WHAT DID YOU END UP DOING TO THE VEHICLE? HE SAID WE FUNCTIONAL TESTED THE SEAT IT'S GOOD TO GO. SO I CALL THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND SPEAK TO THE SERVICE MANAGER. I SAID SO LET ME GET THIS STAIGHT YOU HAD OUR CAR FOR 10 DAYS AND YOU DID A TEST AND HAND MY WIFE BACK THE KEYS? WHERE IS THE NEW SEAT CUSHION? HE SAID TO ME SIR I WANT TO HELP YOU BUT CORPORATE WON'T RELEASE THE PARTS THEY INSTRUCTED ME TO DO THE FUNCTIONAL CHECK AND IF IT PASSED THEY WOULD NOT RELEASE THE PARTS. SO I ASK WHAT IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN WHAT THEN? WELL SIR WE WOULD NEED TO SUBMIT THE SERVICE HISTORY PROBLEM WITH THE NEXT REQUEST TO ESCALATE THE ISSUE.    SO I CALL THE WIFE TELL HER TO GO PICK UP THE CAR BUT ASK THE SERVICE MANAGER TO TAKE A LITTLE RIDE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT TO ENSURE IT WORKS.... SO MY WIFE STARTS THE CAR THEN GOES AT SITS IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. BOOM AIR BAG FAULT LIGHT COME ON IMMEDIATELY WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER STANDING THERE. SERVICE MANAGER TURNS RED. MY WIFE'S SMILES AND SAYS I CAN'T TAKE THIS CAR HOME IT'S NOT SAFE. SO THEY KEEP THE CAR TO TRY AND ORDER THE SEAT CUSHION AGAIN. THE SERVICE MAANGER CALL ME BACK TO (10 JULY) TO LET ME KNOW THEY HACK ESCALATED THE PROBLEM TO SUBARU CORPORATE AND THE CUSHION IS NOW ON ORDER. HOWEVER TURNS OUT 73 CUSHOINS ARE ON BACK ORDER FOR PRETTY MUCH THE SAME ISSUE. THIS MAY REQUIRE A RECALL.
OWN A 2017 SUBARU FORESTER, WE HAVE LESS THAN 11,000 MILES AND LESS THAN ONE YEAR OF OWNERSHIP. A SMALL STONE HITTING THE WINDSHIELD, QUICKLY ENDS UP IN A 24" TO 30" LONG LINEAR CRACK UNLIKE MY OTHER TWO VEHICLES. WE ARE IN PROCESS OF REPLACING 3RD WINDSHIELD GLASS IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR. IT APPEARS THAT THERE MAY BE AN OEM DEFECT.   THIS LONG CRACK CREATES DANGER VISION PROBLEM. EVERY WINDSHIELD REPLACEMENT REQUIRES RE-CALIBRATION OF EYESIGHT TOO. THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL BURDEN ON INSURANCE AS WELL AS OWNERS AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED ASAP. MANUFACTURER HAS NOT YET ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXISTENCE OF DEFECTIVE WINDSHIELD. WE REQUEST THAT CONSUMER PRODUCT RECALL INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE ASAP.
SUBARU OF AMERICA DOES NOT CURRENTLY OFFER AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS AS AN OPTION ON ITS FORESTER PREMIUM TRIM. SUBARU OF AMERICA'S PARTS DEPARTMENT (PARTS.SUBARU.COM), LISTS THE AUTOMATIC LIGHT SENSOR AND SWITCH AS COMPATIBLE WITH THE FORESTER PREMIUM AND GIVES CONSUMERS DETAILS ON OFFICIAL DEALERSHIPS WHERE THESE PARTS CAN BE PURCHASED. SUBARU OF AMERICA CUSTOMER SERVICE, HOWEVER, CLAIMS THAT THESE PARTS ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE 2017 FORESTER PREMIUM, THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE INSTALLED, AND THAT THE ONLY WAY TO GET AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS IS TO UPGRADE TO THE MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE LIMITED TRIM. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE PARTS DEPARTMENT IS INTENTIONALLY MISLEADING CUSTOMERS TO DRIVE PARTS SALES, OR WHETHER CUSTOMER SERVICE IS INTENTIONALLY MISLEADING CUSTOMERS IN THE HOPES OF SELLING CARS WITH HIGHER MSRP; EITHER WAY, SUBARU OF AMERICA IS MISLEADING CONSUMERS ABOUT SPARE/REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR A SAFETY CRITICAL VEHICLE SYSTEM.
My airbag warning light comes on intermittently.  My mechanic found it is due to a recalled part but my vin number is not listed on the recall even though it meets the criteria.  Subaru Safety Recall WUM-98  NHTSA Recall ID 19V 70.   The person in the passenger seat's safety is at risk if the airbags don't deploy in the event of a crash.
Went to car wash,car was in nuetral after after wash finished I put the car in drive and it accelerated into the street at a very high rate of speed my foot was not on the gas.
Airbag on passenger side stopped working last November . Subaru says it’s the switch in the seat and the seat needs replacing at a cost of approximately $1300. This should be part of the recall and be paid for by Subaru.
When there is a passenger in my Subaru Forrester, the Occupant Detection System deactivates the passenger airbag. When I researched the issue, I noticed there is a recall for Foresters but my specific vehicle doesn't fall into the recall. When reviewing Product Campaign Bulletin on the NHTSA website, the Harness Label Inspection Procedure states to inspect the label and if its has supplier code 6578 AND  the date code before 18074, the harness must be replaced. My Forester has both the supplier code and the date code before 18074 but my vehicle doesn't have a recall associated with it so the Subaru service center won't replace it. I'm currently driving with a deactivated airbag and that can't possibly be safe. Please NHTSA,  widen the recall!
The Condenser for the A/C went at 70,700 miles. This is a known problem with 2017-2018 Foresters.
The contact owns a 2018 Subaru Forester. The contact stated that the front passenger’s side seat was extremely hot. Additionally, air bag warning light was illuminated. The contact also stated that the taillights were inoperable. While his wife was driving at an undetermined speed, the vehicle inadvertently lost power steering functionality. The vehicle was taken to the dealer where the taillight bulbs were replaced; however, the failure persisted. The manufacturer was not contacted. The approximate failure mileage was 90,400.
Our windshield cracked again to the edge.  This is the third time it’s cracked and will be our fourth windshield on a 2018 model year car.
The rear seatbacks fold forward by pulling a knob on top of the seat beside headrest. Recently, as I was driving, my 6 year old child, who was restrained in a booster seat, reached up and pulled the knob, thus unlocking the seatback. I'm glad she asked, "what's this do?" or I may not have known that her seatback was not locked into place. We immediately pulled over to lock the seat into place. I see this as a potential safety hazard, that especially puts young children at risk.
I'm filing a complaint regarding a battery drain issue in the 2018 Forester Limited.  After sitting idle and not being started for 1.5-2 weeks the battery is fully drained. Fully drained is defined as the car won't start with a portable jumper.  The power source car needs to be running and connected to the battery of the dead Forester for upwards of 20mins to give it a partial charge prior to the battery dead Forester being able to start.  I've been told various reasons from various dealers and cannot get a straight answer.  [A] one subaru dealersip said it's normal to have a dead battery in 3days.  [B] another subaru dealership said it was because I had a bad battery, but after replacing it the issue still persisted.  I have made sure to manually shut off all lights including making sure the running lights are in the off position, not the automatic on/off position.  This incident has occurred multiple times when traveling for week at a time and upon returning to the car to try and start it and it won't start.  The same dealership [B] claimed that the parasitic draw was because I kept a cigarette lighter car charging adapter plugged in even though the car was off.  I have read several other complaints about this issue regarding this car and hope there can be a recall/legal claim filed against subaru for this issue so they resolve it.
Second time windshield had to be replaced from cracking after sustaining small rock chip.
Battery keeps dying without daily use. I drove my vehicle less than a week ago, no lights left on, nothing in the charging ports, no doors open, and still the battery didn't have enough power to start. I've had to call AAA and have neighbors jump start my vehicle a few times but when I get my battery tested I'm told that my battery is fine and that I do not need a new one. Something is draining my battery and I don't know what.
THE TIRE PRESSURE SENSOR CAME ON AND EVEN AFTER THE TIRES WERE CHECKED AND CORRECT AIR WAS PUT IN THE SENSOR WOULD NOT GO OFF. WE TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAID IT WOULD COST $170.00 TO REPLACE ONE OF THE TIRE PRESSURE SENSORS THEY SAID WERE FAULTY. NEITHER MY WARRANTY OR EXTENDED WARRANTY WOULD COVER IT. MY HUSBAND THEN PURCHASED A TIRE PRESSURE SENSOR AND TOOK IT TO A LOCAL MECHANIC SHOP FOR THEM TO REPLACE IT, WHICH HAVE COST A TOTAL OF $40.00. THE MECHANIC PUT IT ON THEIR COMPUTERS AND COULDN'T IDENTIFY A BAD SENSOR, BUT SOMETHING SHOWING WRONG IN ONE OF THE COMPUTERS READING THE SENSOR. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE DEALER AND TRY TO GET THIS RECTIFIED. IF IT IS A COMPUTER THEN I FEEL IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE SINCE WE CAN NOT GET AN ACCURATE READING AND THE TIRE PRESSURE LIGHT IS STAYING LIT UP ON THE DASHBOARD.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2018 SUBARU FORESTER. THE CONTACT BECAME AWARE OF A CRACK TO THE LOWER WINDSHIELD. THE CONTACT TOOK THE VEHICLE TO HERITAGE SUBARU CATONSVILLE (6624 BALTIMORE NATIONAL PIKE SUITE A, BALTIMORE, MD 21228, (844) 224-1954) WHO STATED THAT THE REPAIR WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. THE VEHICLE HAD NOT BEEN REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND INFORMED THE CONTACT THE REPAIR WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 30,000.
A FEW INCIDENTS HAVE HAPPENED SINCE THE LATTER HALF OF 2020: WHILE AT A STOP LIGHT THAT TURNED GREEN, MY CAR STOPPED MOVING FOR A FEW SECONDS DESPITE PRESSING ON THE GAS PEDAL AND THE RPM WENT UP TO 6/ LOUDLY REVVED. I WAS ALMOST REAR ENDED AT THIS LIGHT.THE CAR HAS ALSO HAD THIS LACK OF MOVEMENT ISSUE ON THE FREEWAY WHILE IN TRAFFIC. MY CAR JERKS SEVERAL TIMES ON SLIGHT INCLINES ESPECIALLY AFTER SURPASSING 40 MPH. OFTEN TIMES, I CANNOT ACCELERATE PAST 40 MPH REGARDLESS IF THE DRIVE IS ON A FLAT SURFACE OR AN INCLINE. THE RPM WILL INCREASE, BUT THE GEAR FEELS LIKE IT WILL GET STUCK AND THE CAR MAKES A LOUD NOISE. THIS IS THE MOST NOTICEABLE GOING FROM 40 MPH TO 50-55 MPH. THESE INCIDENTS ARE ON CITY STREETS. HOWEVER, POWER OFTEN GETS LOST GOING ON TO FREEWAYS FOR THE SAME REASON. I CANNOT SURPASS 40 MPH WHEN ENTERING A FREEWAY AND WAS ALMOST SIDESWIPED ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE BY AN IMPATIENT PERSON ENTERING TOO EARLY WHERE THE ON-RAMP MERGES WITH THE FREEWAY BECAUSE OF THIS. WHILE ON A FREEWAY, THE CAR WILL CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE DESPITE ATTEMPTING TO SLOW IT DOWN BY PRESSING ON THE BRAKE OR COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP. THIS HAS ALSO HAPPENED ON CITY STREETS AND POSES A SAFETY ISSUE. THE ACCELERATION WHEN THIS HAPPENS IS MUCH FASTER THAN WHEN I TRY TO MANUALLY ACCELERATE THE CAR MYSELF IN OTHER CONTEXTS, LIKE MENTIONED ABOVE. I BELIEVE IT IS THE CVT AS THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM WITH CARS OF MY MAKE, MODEL, AND YEAR.
IKEY WILL NOT COME OUT OF THE IGNITION SWITCH AFTER THE CAR IS STOPPED, PUT IN PARK, BRAKE [PEDDLE DEPRESSED.
HAVE HAD TO REPLACE WINDSHIELD FULL REPLACEMENTS 3 TIMES IN 2 1/2 YEARS.  USUALLY A SMALL ROCK KICKED UP FROM HIGHWAY STARTS THE CHIP AND IT SPREADS VERY QUICKLY. I HAVE HAD CHIP FILLED BUT IT STILL CRACKS ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD SO THE WHOLE WINDSHIELD HAS TO BE REPLACED AGAIN.
WINDSHIELD CRACKED DUE TO AN UNKNOWN REASON.  13" CRACK IN THE CENTER OF THE WINDSHIELD STARTING AT THE BASE.  VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY.  MY ONLY SPECULATION IS THAT SNOW COVERED THE WINDSHIELD DURING THE NIGHT AND THE SUN HEATED THE INTERIOR OF THE VEHICLE IN THE MORNING CAUSING AN ABRUPT TEMPERATURE STRESS ON THE GLASS.  DEFECTIVE WINDSHIELD.
UNKNOWN. I DROVE MY CAR BACK FROM A WEEKEND TRIP AND SAW NO DAMAGE DURING THAT TIME. I THEN PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY AND DID NOT DRIVE MY CAR AGAIN FOR 3 DAYS. WHEN I RETURNED TO DRIVE MY CAR, THERE WAS A LARGE CRACK ACROSS THE DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD. THE CRACK DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE PROPAGATED FROM DAMAGE FROM A PROJECTILE AND WAS NOT PRESENT WHEN I HAD DRIVEN MY CAR 3 DAYS EARLIER. BASED ON THE SIZE AND LOCATION OF THE CRACK, I HAD TO REPLACE THE WINDSHIELD.
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2018 SUBARU FORESTER. WHILE DRIVING VARIOUS SPEEDS, THE VEHICLE STALLED AND SOMETIMES LOST POWER. THE VEHICLE RESTARTED AFTER IT WAS SHUT OFF. THERE WAS NO WARNING INDICATOR ILLUMINATED. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO SUBARU SHERMAN OAKS (888-690-1521, LOCATED AT 5747 VAN NUYS BLVD, VAN NUYS, CA 91401) WHERE THE TECHNICIAN TEST DROVE THE VEHICLE, BUT WAS UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE FAILURE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE AND STATED THAT SOMEONE WOULD FOLLOW UP WITH THE DEALER. THE CONTACT WAS NOT CALLED BACK. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS NOT PROVIDED.
FRONT PASSENGER AIRBAG HAS BEEN INTERMITTENTLY ON AND OFF, WITH AND WITHOUT A PASSENGER, WITH AND WITHOUT ITEMS ON THE SEAT. THIS IS THE THIRD OR MAYBE FOURTH OCCASION VEHICLE IS AT THE DEALER. ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES THEY INSPECTED THE CAR, AND THEIR SOLUTION WAS TO RELOCATE THE "MODULE" (WHATEVER THE MODULE IS) FOR THAT SEAT. THEY STATED IT WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM. A MONTH LATER THE CAR STARTED TO DO THE PASSENGER AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT ON AND OFF AGAIN. CAR BACK AGAIN TO DEALER BUT THEN LIGHT WAS GONE OFF. YESTERDAY, SEP 23, 2019 CAR WAS DROPPED AGAIN AT DEALER WITH LIGHT ON AND THE CAR STILL ON, IN ORDER NOT TO LOSE THE SITUATION AT RESTART. THEY JUST CALLED ME AND STATE THE SEAT AIRBAG WAS REPLACED $1,100 UNDER WARRANTY, CAR IS 6500 MILES OR SO. THAT WE COULD NOT LOCATE ANYTHING OTHER THAN A PASSENGER ON THAT SEAT. ANY ITEM, CELLULAR, TABLET, COMPUTER, BATTERY, BAGS, PURSUES, SHOPPING ITEMS, PAPERS, DOCUMENTS ON THAT SEAT WILL POSSIBLY CAUSE THE SITUATION AGAIN AND THEY WONT COVER IT UNDER WARRANTY. ALSO NOTHING IN FRONT OF THAT SEAT BY THE FLOOR..??? NOT POSSIBLE TO RECLINE THE BACK OF THE SEAT.... WHAT? THIS IS MY FIRST CAR DOING THAT. I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY TO US, IT'S THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND A DEADLY RISK DRIVE THIS CAR WITH THE PASSENGER LIGHT ON AND A PASSENGER IN IT AND BEEN INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT. THIS HAPPENS WITH THE CAR  ON, BUT PARKED, STOPPED WAITING FOR A LIGHT TO CHANGE, MOVING, GOING FORWARD, GOING REVERSE, AND IS INTERMITTENT.
WHILE PARKING IN A LOT: WHEN PULLING INTO A SPACE,  HIT BRAKE PEDAL AND CAR ACCELERATED RESULTING IN MINOR DAMAGE TO MY CAR AND OTHERS CARS. I BELIEVE THE CAR MALFUNCTIONED RESULTING IN THIS ACCIDENT.
THE PASSENGER SEAT AIRBAG HAS NOT BEEN WORKING FOR ABOUT 9 MONTHS MAKING IT DANGEROUS FOR A PASSENGER (OR NOT AVAILABLE FOR PASSENGER SEAT OCCUPANCY). THE PARTS HAVE BEEN ON ORDER FOR MONTHS BUT STILL NOT DELIVERED.  THERE ARE MANY OF THESE ON BACKORDER INDICATING TO ME A SIGNIFICANT SAFERY PROBLEM.
ALL MY CARS FROM 2001 THRU 20176  FORDS TOYOTAS MAZDAS ETC.

My Subaru smelled like gas and caught on fire while I was driving to work less than 72 hours after it left the service department at the local Subaru dealership. Earlier that week I dropped the car off for service due to a check engine light and multiple other warning lights on the dashboard. The check engine light was determined to be due to a faulty thermo control valve (a known issue on several models of 2019-2021 Subarus). During that service appointment, the thermo control valve was replaced under warranty, the 60000 mile service, state inspection, and an oil change/tire rotation were completed. The morning of the incident, the car smelled like gas, but there were no warning lights on the dashboard and the temperature and gas gauges were all in range. While looking for a safe place to pull over on the side of the road, the gas smell worsened, I heard a pop, the check engine light and every single other light on the dashboard lit up, it smelled like burning jet fuel,  and the front of the car was smoking and there were flames, and all mechanical and electrical control of the vehicle was compromised. The car coasted to the side of the right lane. I was unable to operate the gear shift to put the car in park. I opened the driver’s side door, removed my seatbelt, grabbed my backpack, lunch bag, and phone, and exited the vehicle while it was still rolling. I ran around the back of the car to get onto the side walk. Flaming, melting pieces of plastic were coming off the bottom of the car. Flames and smoke were visible on the front hood of the car. I called 911 while the car continued to roll across several lanes onto the other side of the road. The burning car rolled and hit a guardrail on the opposite side of the road and continued to burn until the local Fire Department arrived on scene. Local police and the fire inspector wrote reports. My insurance declared the car a total loss. I have informed the local dealership and worked to get them access to the vehicle.
cracked windshield
I have had multiple issues with my car for the past month. First, my rear right wheel has been making a fan-like sound when going above 35mph and it gets louder until 70mph. It is most likely the wheel bearings going out but, I only have around 50,000 miles on the car. This seems to be a common issue with Foresters. Secondly, my rear Harman Kardon speakers have stopped working. This also appears to be a recurring issue with Forester's, with both their standard and premium sound systems. Lastly, my engine check light turned on and shut off my adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning, emergency braking, and rear automatic braking. I'm surprised that these issues are still happening to Subaru since they have been complained about by consumers for years.
The thermo control valve (TCV), responsible for regulating cabin temperature and engine temperature failed, causing the vehicle to go into safe mode and was not drivable.
Defective/failed thermal control valve. Valve failed while I was driving, resulting in safety systems (e.g., lane keep assist, pre-collision braking). Looking this up, this is a known issue to Subaru.
The contact owns a  2019 Subaru Forester. The contact stated that while stopping, the contact went to park in a parking lot and the vehicle had launched forward while the foot was still on the brake pedal which caused the contact to crash into a tree. The air bags did not deploy. The vehicle was going 1 MPH. No warning light was illuminated. A police report was filed. The vehicle was towed to a dealership. The vehicle had not been diagnosed or repaired by an independent mechanic or dealer. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure and advised the contact to tow her vehicle to the nearest dealership for diagnosis. The failure mileage was approximately 22,000. The VIN was not available.
On June 20, 2023, the "check engine" light came on my 2019 Subaru Forester and "Eyesight" flashed on my dashboard as disabled.  I immediately went to my mechanic and he ran a diagnostic which showed the following: "P26A3 - Engine Coolant Bypass Valve."   My car has 75,000 miles and is out of warranty for the powertrain.  In reviewing online forums, this problem is a recurring one that is affecting many Subaru owners.  The cost is $1,200 to $1,500 to fix. I believe this should be a recall issue.  Other drivers have noted sudden engine shutoff but I have not experienced that yet.  The car is currently in the shop.  Subaru knows this is a problem.
SRS warning light illuminates after honking of horn (horn activator on central steering wheel). After turning off the car and then restarting, the warning light is not visible,  but then the warning light recurred after honking horn again during driving. Appointment for evaluation at dealer scheduled.
Apparently the electrical system drains the battery when the car is not being used. If I let my car sit for 3 days the battery will be dead when I come out to use it.
Car is continually draining battery, causing vehicle to fail twice now due to a completely dead battery, once was while parked, once while idling with car in drive on road.
Vehicle will not start after it has rained or if auto shut down occurs while it is raining. Vehicle has to be jump started if raining. Might start if “dried out” or left in dry conditions.
The windshield was cracked. I heard a pop and then a 15 inch crack spread horizontally across the front windshield in a couple seconds. This is a safety issue because it impaired visibility and altered the integrity of the vehicle. I took pictures of it. It has not been inspected or fixed yet but I have an appointment to do so. There were no warning lights
Car battery drained.  Have had to call AAA twice.  Have now purchased another battery and it failed to auto start when I attempted to cross the intersection.
I was sitting in park w/ac on and heard a crack looked up, initially saw nothing a few minutes later I saw a crack that has continued to spread.
On December 30, 2021,  I was driving on I-95 S around 4 pm about 1/2 a mile from exit 43B when my 2019 Subaru Forester with 64,000 miles stalled in the middle of the highway.  I was going about Highway speed during rush hour 55-65 pmh when the check engine light came ON, the EyeSight feature light came ON, and the emergency Brake light came ON.  Scariest moment in my life.  The vehicle stalled, the steering got really stiff, and the vehicle started sputtering along probably at 2 mph.   I managed to make my way to the breakdown lane and called Subaru Starlink Roadside Assistance.   After towing the vehicle to the dealership, the diagnosis revealed that both tumble generators on the Air Intake Manifold failed and I also needed a fuel line replacement. After doing a lot of research on the internet it appears that Subaru Foresters have a history of these failures and there has been a number of recalls for this particular model detailing the vehicle losing power or stalling.   Unfortunately, the dealership and corporate Subaru refuse to cover the full cost of the repairs as they claim the vehicle is past the warranty period; they have $750 to cover $1800 worth of repairs.   This is clearly a safety issue and defect, and Subaru is clearly neglecting its responsibility to cover known defects from the factory.
The car was parked for a week while visiting. (It has recently had its 30,000 mi.service) When I got in and started it, all the dashboard lights lit up including check engine. I tried reaching a Subaru near where I was visiting. No luck so I called my Subaru in VT. I was told I was safe to go as long as the Check Engine wasn't blinking. It wasn't so I drove home (I did note the steering wheel felt "tight".) When I went into the dealership upon my return, they did their computer diagnostic test. It was explained it could be as simple as not tightening the gas cap.  The computer turned up something in the wheel. At first, he wanted to give me an appointment a week and a half out, but then found a car he could loan me that following Monday. I wanted to know why they needed it several days. He said it was to figure out the issue. When I asked if it was safe to drive, he said it was but there was a possibility of being on the highway and losing control/not being able to stop, but that was rare. I asked about the change in steering, as though the power steering was lost, and he explained they don't have that kind of system. I drove home slowly and went no where except Sunday when I drove a couple of miles to a farm stand close by.  Upon returning into the driveway, I put it in reverse to park. It accelerated and when I tried braking, it wouldn't respond. It was a though everything was locked. The car jolted. Sped. Jolted. The side airbags deployed. My arm was banged up from the airbags but nothing broken. I did not mistake the accelerator for the brake. The floor mat did not get stuck under the accelerator (I've Weather Tech Mats.)  When the car got towed, it started. The tow driver said it should not have done that with the side airbags deployed.   (It won't let me type in the box How Fast Were You Going. It should have been 2mph. The car accelerated and lack of braking and control contributed to the crash.
Date of incident: 16JUL2021; Mileage at time of incident: 23,202; Driving home from having a recall repair at the dealership, the front windshield cracked with no apparent outside impact. Crack originated in the area where the de-icer for the wipers is located vertically in the middle of the windshield. In an approximate 30 minute time frame the crack proceeded vertically up the middle of the windshield at which point it started to move in a horizontal direction toward the driver side directly at eye level.
We bought our Subaru Forester after researching the cars with the best safety features.   The car feels unsafe because of 2 problems:  Engine hesitation and sudden acceleration. We have barely avoided an incident on two occasions in a parking lot.  We were braking for a car heading toward us when our car lurched ahead coming close to hitting an approaching car. Another time we were braking for a stop sign and the car accelerated into moving traffic. We have not reported it to our dealer hoping it was a fluke.  We are going to bring it to the dealer because it's obvious that there is something dangerously wrong with our car.  I can't report dates - it happens each time we drive with no warning - no lights.  Suddenly the engine hesitates acting like it has run out of gas or it lurches ahead, accelerating on its own.
TWICE LAST WINTER I NEEDED TO JUMP START THE VEHICLE BECAUSE THE BATTERY HAD BEEN DRAINED. THIS OCCURRED AFTER THE VEHICLE WAS UNUSED FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. WE LATER REALIZED THAT THE CONTROLLER AREA NETWORK (CAN) WAS OPERATING EVEN WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS TURNED OFF. WE LEARNED THIS WHEN WE HEARD A WHIRRING NOISE COMING FROM THE CAR AT TIMES WHEN IT WAS PARKED IN THE GARAGE AND NOT BEING USED. THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THIS WAS NORMAL, AND THE CAR WAS DOING WHAT IT SHOULD. DRAINING THE BATTERY IS NOT NORMAL.
WINDSHIELD CRACKED FOR NO REASON.  I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE INTERSTATE AND IT CRACKED.  I HAD IT REPLACED WITH A NEW SUBARU WINDSHIELD AND 2 WEEKS LATER THE NEW WINDSHIELD CRACKED WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE INTERSTATE.
ON 2/9/21 I NOTICED A CRACK IN THE LOWER CORNER OF MY WINDSHIELD ON THE PASSENGER SIDE, NEAR THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS. IT WASN'T HIT BY ANY OBJECT AND THERE'S NO POINT OF IMPACT FROM A ROCK OR OTHER ITEM. IT JUST BEGAN TO CRACK BEHIND THE WIPER. THIS IS THE 5TH WINDSHIELD I HAVE HAD ON THIS VEHICLE. 4 WINDSHIELDS HAVE HAD TO BE REPLACED AND THIS IS ANOTHER ONE THAT WILL PROBABLY NEED REPLACED TOO. THERE ARE CURRENTLY 3 SMALL DEFECTS/ CRACKS IN THIS WINDOW ALONG WITH THIS NEW UNEXPLAINED CRACK.
SATURDAY, DEC 26, AROUND 2:30-3PM I WAS LEAVING ESTES PARK COLORADO, DRIVING DOWN A WINDY MOUNTAIN ROAD. AT THIS TIME I WAS APPLYING MY BRAKES AROUND THE CORNERS AND , CONSTANT ON/OFF FROM THE BRAKE PEDAL. DURING ONE OF THESE BRAKING MOMENTS ON A CORNER MY CAR ACCELERATED INSTEAD, AS I'M APPLYING THE BRAKE, FOR 1-2 SECONDS. IT'S LIKE A LURCH FORWARD INSTEAD OF A BRAKE. THEN IT CORRECTED ITSELF AND DID NOT DO THIS AGAIN. I ALSO EXPERIENCED THIS PHENOMENON WHEN DRIVING IN THE SNOW IN 2019. IT OCCURRED 3-4 TIMES WHEN I WAS DRIVING IN THE SNOW APPLYING THE BRAKE FREQUENTLY.  THE CAR WOULD UNEXPECTEDLY LURCH FORWARD WHILE MY FOOT IS ON THE BRAKE. EACH TIME I'VE EXPERIENCED THIS I WAS DRIVING WITH ECO MODE ON, PRESSING THE BRAKE FREQUENTLY FOR A DURATION OF TIME. IT'S AS IF THE CAR GETS CONFUSED OR IS TRYING TO SWITCH GEARS. THIS IS MY FIRST AWD VEHICLE.
WINDSHIELD CHIP FOR NO APPARENT REASON ON RURAL ROAD
WINDSHIELD CRACKED, ABOUT 12" LONG, FROM THE BOTTOM UP INTO THE VIEWING AREA WHILE SITTING IN A DRIVEWAY OVERNIGHT.
I FIRST NOTICED A SMALL NICK IN THE FRONT WINDSHIELD ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE BACK IN FEBRUARY 2020.  IN JUNE OF 2020, IT TURNED INTO A CRACK THAT RUNS 1/2 THE LENGTH OF THE WINDSHIELD.  I'VE ATTACHED PICTURES OF THE NICK AND CRACK.  *TR
WITHOUT BEING HIT BY ANY ROCKS OR OTHER OBJECTS, THE WINDSHIELD DEVELOPED A CRACK WHILE IT WAS PARKED. THE CRACK DEVELOPED FROM THE BASELINE OF THE WINDSHIELD AND IS ABOUT 9 INCHES LONG.  *TR
SECOND CRACKED WINDSHIELD AFTER ONLY 12,000 MILES. PEBBLE STRIKE ON FREEWAY DEVELOPED INTO HUGE CRACK IN ONLY A MATTER OF MINUTES. I WAS DRIVING SPEED LIMIT AND KEPT DISTANCE FROM CAR IN FRONT OF ME. PICKUP TRUCK PASSING ON LEFT MUST HAVE KICKED UP PEBBLE.
APPROXIMATELY ONE MONTH AFTER PURCHASING A BRAND NEW SUBARU FORRESTER 2019 TOURING VEHICLE DIRECTLY FROM SUBARU, THE WINDSHIELD SUFFERED A CRACK. ON FEBRUARY 24, 2019, I WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE ON A HIGHWAY IN CALIFORNIA WHEN A SMALL ROCK HIT THE WINDSHIELD AND CREATED A SMALL DENT WHICH THEN SPLINTERED INTO A CRACK THAT SPREAD FURTHER AND FURTHER THROUGHOUT THE WINDSHIELD. MY INSURANCE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT WINDSHIELD NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. I USED A LOCAL COMPANY TO REPLACE THE WINDSHIELD WITH A BRAND NEW WINDSHIELD FROM SUBARU AND THEN I HAD SUBARU RECALIBRATE THE EYESIGHT CAMERA. MY INSURANCE DEDUCTIBLE LIMITED THE TOTAL COST FOR THIS REPAIR AND RECALIBRATION.    APPROXIMATELY ONE YEAR LATER, ON FEBRUARY 16, 2020, ONCE AGAIN, WHILE DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY IN CALIFORNIA, SMALL ROCKS HIT THE WINDSHIELD AND CREATED TWO SMALL DENTS (EACH SMALLER IN SIZE THAN A QUARTER). FORTUNATELY, THESE DENTS DID NOT SPLINTER INTO CRACKS BUT THEY BOTH NEEDED TO BE FILLED. THE COST WAS COVERED FOR THIS OUT OF POCKET.    I AM NOT CERTAIN BUT MY BEST ASSESSMENT IS THAT SUBARU'S WINDSHIELD FOR THE 2019 FORRESTER MAY BE DEFECTIVE. IN NEITHER CASE WAS I SPEEDING, NOR WERE THE ROCKS THAT HIT THE WINDSHIELD LARGE.    THE ATTACHED DOCUMENT INCLUDES THE COST OF WINDSHIELD REPLACEMENT, EYESIGHT RECALIBRATION, AND DENT FILLINGS.
I WENT OUTSIDE IN THE MORNING AND MY SUBARU HAD A HUGE CRACK ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED TO CAUSE THE CRACK. THE CAR WAS PARKED IN THE DRIVEWAY RIGHT UP IN FRONT OF THE GARAGE. THE CRACK RADIATED OUT ACROSS THE ENTIRE WINDSHIELD AND RENDERED THE EYE-SIGHT UNABLE TO WORK. INSURANCE STATE FARM CLAIM NUMBER IS 19-B151-3T0
WINDSHIELD CRACKED HALF WAY ACROSS
PARKED MY VEHICLE IN MY DRIVEWAY WITH NO OVERHEAD COVER AFTER I RETURNED HOME FROM WORK AT APPROXIMATELY 1430 HOURS ON 2/7/20. THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AT THIS TIME WAS APPROXIMATELY 25 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. THE VEHICLES WINDSHIELD DID NOT HAVE A CRACK AT THIS TIME. NOTHING HIT MY WINDSHIELD ON MY WAY HOME FROM WORK. I STARTED MY VEHICLE WITH MY REMOTE START LEAVING MY RESIDENCE AT APPROXIMATELY 1800 HOURS ON THE SAME DATE. AS I SAT IN THE OPERATORS SEAT OF MY VEHICLE APPROXIMATELY 1 MINUTE AFTER I INITIATED THE REMOTE START, I OBSERVED A LARGE CRACK IN MY WINDSHIELD. THE CRACK STARTS BELOW MY WINDSHIELD WIPER UNDER THE PLASTIC PIECE WHERE THE EDGE OF THE WINDSHIELD GLASS IS COVERED. UPON CLOSER INSPECTION FROM OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE I DISCOVERED ZERO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT AN OBJECT HAD STRUCK MY VEHICLES WINDSHIELD. THE CRACK APPEARS TO HAVE SPONTANEOUSLY OCCURRED. I PERFORMED SOME RESEARCH ONLINE AND DISCOVERED SPONTANEOUS WINDSHIELD CRACKS ON MY PARTICULAR VEHICLE IS A KNOWN ISSUE DUE TO SUBPAR DEFECTIVE GLASS AND THAT CRACKS ARE CAUSED BY THE HEAT FROM THE WINDSHIELD WIPER HEATER USED IN COMBINATION WITH THE WINDSHIELD DEFROSTER. WHICH IS THE EXACT CIRCUMSTANCE MY WINDSHIELD CRACKED IN. RESEARCH ALSO ADVISED THAT THIS A KNOWN ISSUE THAT HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED BY SUBARU NOR DO THEY COVER REPAIR/REPLACEMENT COSTS. WINDSHIELD REPAIR/REPLACEMENT IS VERY EXPENSIVE BECAUSE OF THE SPECIAL OEM SUBARU GLASS THAT IS REQUIRED IN ORDER FOR THE SUBARU EYESIGHT SENSORS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY WHICH MY VEHICLE IS EQUIPPED WITH. SUBARU ALSO REFUSES TO COVER THE COSTLY RECALIBRATION OF THE SUBARU EYESIGHT SENSORS WHICH IS REQUIRED WHEN THE WINDSHIELD IS REPLACED. RECALIBRATION ALONE COSTS APPROXIMATELY $1000-$2000 USD IN ADDITION TO THE COST OF THE WINDSHIELD AND WINDSHIELD INSTALLATION. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR A MANUFACTURING DEFECT THAT SUBARU APPEARS TO IGNORE
A SMALL CHIP IN THE WINDSHIELD TOWARDS THE CENTER. THIS HAS PROBABLY NOT HAPPENED DURING DRIVING AND THE CHIP WAS CONFIRMED DURING THE FIRSTS ERVICE.
IN UNDER 8 WEEKS MY WINDSHIELD HAS HAD 3 CHIPS AND FINALLY IT HAS CRACKED TO THE POINT WHERE I HAVE TO HAVE IT REPLACED. AFTER THE 2ND CHIP I REALIZED THIS WAS NOT BAD LUCK BUT FAULTY PRODUCT. I CONTACTED MY DEALER & THE SUBARU FACTORY WITH NO HELP. THE FIRST 3 CHIPS HAPPENED WHEN I WAS DRIVING THE 4TH JUST WARMING UP THE CAR. I UNDERSTAND PEBBLES HIT YOUR WINDSHIELD WHEN DRIVING BUT THE 4TH TIME IT HAPPENED THE CAR WAS STATIONARY
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2019 SUBARU FORESTER. WHILE DRIVING 70 MPH, THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE WINDSHIELD CRACKED ON ITS OWN. THERE WERE NO WARNING INDICATORS ILLUMINATED. THE CONTACT CALLED HER INSURANCE COMPANY AND AN EMPLOYEE WAS SENT TO PERFORM A TEMPORARY REMEDY ON THE CRACK TO PREVENT MORE DAMAGE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED OR REPAIRED. THE DEALER AND MANUFACTURER WERE NOT NOTIFIED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 8,350. *LN  *TR
WHILE DRIVING TO WORK ON SEPTEMBER 3, 2019, I HEARD A NOISE AND SAW THAT A CRACK APPEARED TO THE LEFT OF THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE WINDOW.  IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 4 INCHES STRAIGHT ACROSS. I CALLED MY INSURANCE AGENCY TO REPORT IT.  IT TOOK A WEEK FOR THE WINDSHIELD TO COME IN.  DURING THAT WEEK THE CRACK SPREAD TO THE CENTER OF THE CAR.  THE WINDSHIELD COMPANY FIXED IT AND 2 WEEKS TO THE DAY, MY HUSBAND AND I WERE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AND HEARD SOMETHING HIT THE WINDSHIELD.  I KNOW HAVE A SPIDER WEB CRACK IN MY WINDSHIELD.  SO FAR IT HASN'T GONE ANY FURTHER SO I HAVE NOT CONTACTED MY INSURANCE COMPANY YET.
I PURCHASED A 2019 SUBARU FORESTER IN MID-JULY AND HAVE HAD TO REPLACE TWO WINDSHIELDS DUE TO CRACKING. THE FIRST REPLACEMENT WAS IN SEPTEMBER DUE TO A ROCK HITTING THE WINDSHIELD ON THE FAR RIGHT PASSENGER SIDE. THE CHIP QUICKLY DEVELOPED INTO AN 18' CRACK. I NOTICED A SECOND CRACK YESTERDAY WHICH ORIGINATED BEHIND THE WIPER BLADE IN THE BOTTOM CENTER OF THE WINDSHIELD THAT EXTENDS ON A 16' ARCH IN THE SAME DIRECTION OF THE WIPER BLADE MOTION. THERE IS VERY SMALL CHIP, LOCATED BEHIND THE METAL PORTION OF THE WIPER BLADE FROM A ROCK THAT MUST HAVE FALLEN OUT OF THE SKY. I WAS TRAVELING IN THE VEHICLE ON M55 BETWEEN LAKE CITY AND CADILLAC ON PAVED ROADS BUT HAD STARTED OUT THE MORNING IN MARQUETTE, MI WHERE THE TEMPERATURES WHERE IN THE 30S WITH A RAIN/SNOW MIX. I DID NOT HEAR ANY ROCK HIT THE WINDSHIELD.
THE WINDSHIELD SPONTANEOUSLY CRACKED ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.  I WAS DRIVING STRAIGHT ABOUT 40MPH ON A HOT DAY MID-SEPTEMBER WITH THE A/C GOING.  THERE WAS A SUDDEN "POP" AND I NOTICED A CURVED CRACK HAD INSTANTLY APPEARED ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.  THERE WERE NO CARS NEAR ME.  LOOKING AT THE WINDSHIELD, I DIDN'T SEE AN OBVIOUS IMPACT BUT I COULD SEE NEAR THE DEFROSTER TRACES THE CRACK APPEARED TO FORM THERE.  I'M CONCERNED THIS COULD HAVE BEEN FROM THERMAL STRESS AND THE WINDSHIELD SHOULD NOT HAVE CRACKED THAT EASILY.  THE CRACK APPEARS TO BE COMING FROM INSIDE TO OUTSIDE AND SOME OF THE GLASS SORT OF FLAKED WHEN I PROBED IT WITH MY FINGER.
I WAS DRIVING ON HIGHWAY AND DID NOT HEAR A ROCK OR ANY OBJECT HIT WINDSHIELD. WHEN I ARRIVED HOME I NOTICED A CRACK IN WINDSHIELD BEGINNING AT DEICER OF WINDSHIELD UP TO 25% UPWARDS FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE WINDSHIELD. THE WINDOW APPEARS TO BE BRITTLE AND SUBARU PREVIOUSLY HAD SAME ISSUE WITH 2016 OUTBACKS. SUBARU DENIED THIS WAS WITHIN WARRANTY. I PURCHASED THE CAR NEW 3-4 WEEKS AGO.
REAR SIDE WINDOW ON THE LEFT (DRIVER'S) SIDE BURST WHILE VEHICLE WAS PARKED.  SHATTERED INTO LARGE AND SMALL PIECES.
WINDSHIELD CRACKED FROM A SMALL PEBBLE AFTER HAVING THE CAR FOR 5 DAYS. I WAS DRIVING ON A CITY STREET, TRAVELING LESS THAN 40 MPH WHEN A PEBBLE HIT THE DRIVER'S SIDE EDGE OF THE WINDSHIELD.   THE WINDSHIELD SHOULD BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND PEBBLES BEING THROWN UP FROM THE ROAD. THIS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY THE MANUFACTURER. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THIS WINDSHIELD CANNOT HANDLE DEBRIS HITTING IT. NO DIVOTS OR PITTING IN THE WINDSHIELD, JUST AN IMMEDIATE CRACK THAT GROWS. VERY DISAPPPOINTED WITH THIS VEHICLE'S WINDSHIELD.
WINDSHIELD CRACK AND ROCK CHIP. THE SUBARU OEM WINDSHIELD IS VERY WEAK AND I'VE ALREADY NOTICED A CHIP ON THE WINDSHIELD FOR A CAR THAT IS 5 MONTHS OLD. SEVERAL OWNERS HAVE ALREADY FILED A COMPLAINT FOR THE PREVIOUS YEARS, AND ITS THE SAME FOR 2019 AS WELL.
Unknown or auto stop-start On two occasions when I stopped at a red light (auto stop-start activated) the car stalled out when I hit the gas. There was a warning message that alerted on the dash as well as flashing lights and beeping. The only way to restart my car was to put it in park, turn it off, then turn it back on. These were both at heavily used intersections and I had to use my emergency lights to try prevent being rear-ended and both times I have struggled to quickly resolve the issue which caused danger to others as well. My car has been serviced and inspected in the last 2 months so I am unsure the cause.  I had received no alerts or warnings on my car prior to these instances and assumed the first instance was a fluke.  I have scheduled a service with a subaru dealer in the near future.
The head unit suddenly stopped working. It unfortunately isn’t covered Under warranty. The screen consistently turns on and off.
I was driving to work and many of my warning lights suddenly came on. This includes my check engine light, my lane assist light, my auto collision braking, my eye sight disabled and my cool engine light keeps going on and off. My cabin heating also isn’t working. There is no reason for this happening other than my thermo control valve failing.
1-16-24:car wouldn’t open and start; jump-started by AAA to dealer; dealer kept overnight & checked battery: said charge held, ready to go home. 1-30-24, 4 pm-ish: able to start n drive, but check engine& eyesight warning light came on- late in day, so didn’t drive to dealer. 1-31-24: car dead; jump-started by AAA again & drove to dealer. On 2-1-24, dealer sends a video & says replaced battery, but check engine light & eye sight warning light still on; investigated further & found there was a lot of water that had pooled under the passenger seat & caused some corrosion- I.e.: shorted out electrical system. I asked dealer to report to Subaru since this seemed like a car defect. 2-9-24- dealer says Subaru won’t repair it at their expense and it’s a 25 hour job & will cost a lot. Dealer wanted me to file a claim with my insurance, but car was not driven through rain, high water, or stored in a flooded garage or on a flooded street. The water in the car seems like a design defect on the part of Subaru.
Windshield spontaneously cracked from the base into the wiper area. There was no previously known damage. This impacts driver visibility and weakens the windshield. I have not had the windshield inspected by another party and did not observe any warnings. I have since learned online that this is an ongoing issue with some Subaru windshields.
The contact owns a 2020 Subaru Forester. The contact stated that the windshield was cracked. The crack had developed on the passenger’s side of the windshield’s edge where the windshield meets the frame and expanded 6 inches horizontally. The contact had not taken the vehicle to the local dealer or the glass shop. The windshield was not replaced. The manufacturer had not been informed of the failure. The failure mileage was 8,978.
Windshield cracked in the bottom black area. This is a known problem for other model years. Subaru should issue a recall / fix for the 2020 Forester also.
I was on the highway doing 70 mph with the adaptive cruise control set.   Then suddenly the check engine light turned on, the eye site and cruise shut down and the car slowed down quickly to 60 mph almost getting rear ended.  This Subaru Forester has 65,592 miles.  The Subaru Dealer said that the cooling therm valve is bad and needs to be replaced.   This cooling therm valve seems to be a major part of the engine and they want $1500 to fix the problem.
Windshield suddenly cracked from lower passenger side almost 2-feet long. No obvious cause, driving around 50 mph in 62 degrees, clear sky.
I have a 2020 subaru forester with low mileage.   A few weeks ago, I started to move forward when the traffic light turned green.  There is a car in front of me that started to move forward.  There was another car perpendicular to my right.  I started to apply the gas, and the car fought me and was appying the brakes.   I saw no reason for the car to brake.  This concerns me.  I was on dry pavement in daylight.  I fear if this had happened when the roads were covered with ice or snow, it could have caused me to spin out.
I believe the SUBARU FORESTER 2020 WINDSHIELD is dangerous and is a system failure.  In April, 2022 a piece of gravel hit the windshield--smaller than the size of a quarter.  Within hours, the windshield had fractured so much that there was no way that I could continue to drive safely as the windshield flowered and split the driver's eye view.  I reported the claim to insurance (USAA) and took the car on May 12, 2022 to Safelight to be repaired.  After working on it for three hours, they couldn't get the EYESIGHT to calibrate.  I drove for two weeks without those safety features until I could get to Safelight again.  After 3 more hrs I was finally told to take it to the dealership to finalize repairs and again the EYESIGHT was not calibrated.  Those safety features were not available until on June 6, 2022 the delearship calibrated EYESIGHT.  Driving on July 20, 2022 a small piece of gravel hit the passenger corner and within 2 hrs, split the windshield again.  I have NEVER had a windshield perform like this--it is very dangerous and I believe in a crash, the windshield would INJURE me rather than prevent impact.  I am worried about my safety.  I cannot afford to repair the windshield when it may happen again.  In 44 years of driving, I have NEVER had a windshield that was so weak.
There have been three cracks in the front windshield in 18 months with little to no provocation. These have required replacement of the front windshield and re-calibration of eyesight. With each crack, there was little to no cause.  On one occasion, there was a tiny piece of gravel that resulted in a crack that extended across 50% of the front windshield. My concern is for my personal safety should the windshield crack and cause harm to me as the driver or impair my visibility while driving which increases my risk for an accident.  There’s also the concern about cost and time spent with repeated replacements.  The date of incident below is the date of the third crack
I was driving in fine weather, in a smooth highway when a crack occurred in the windshield for no apparent reason. I initially thought a dust particle must have hit in the wrong place, but then was alerted to the fact that a windshield should not break for no apparent reason. I have owned cars for decades, and this is the first time that I have had a windshield crack, and in a nearly new car. It is a Forester 2020. I drove a Forester 2002 for nearly fifteen years with no issue ever. I have, upon research, found out that I am one of many people waiting for Subaru windshields for my same model, and that there is clearly a pattern that suggests an error in the making. I called Subaru of America and also my dealership and neither one seemed receptive to my concerns, nor showed any awareness of windshield issues. I did my own research after the glass company alerted me to the fact that there is a class action lawsuit for my very vehicle in process due to overwhelming problems with the windshields cracking for no apparent reason. I find this really concerning. Subaru markets itself for its all terrain vehicles, and while I only drive on roads and highways, they are vehicles supposedly designed to go through much rougher terrain. The problems with the windshields are a concerning safety alert for all the owners of these vehicles, and particularly for those who use them in a variety of terrains. I did find through my own research that there are indeed lawsuits currently in process for this very issue, and that prior models were already recalled as well.
The windshield has a crack that has grown exponentially. It seems to be very susceptible to impact cracks and chips.
The glass broke after the windshield wiper was placed down on it. The windshield glass is broken twice this year. I just replaced it several months ago. It has cracked in the same spot on the passenger side right
The contact owns a 2020 Subaru Forester. The contact stated while the vehicle was parked and unattended, the contact became aware that the front windshield had cracked from the top without impact. The contact called the local dealer however, the vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 14,000. The VIN was not available.
The contact owns a 2020 Subaru Forester. The contact stated that upon entering her vehicle, she noticed that a crack had formed on the bottom passenger side of the windshield without incident. Over time, the crack had spread to the driver's side of the windshield which obstructed her vision while driving. The contact was informed by the dealer that her vehicle would not be covered under warranty and that there were no recalls on her vehicle. The manufacturer had yet to be notified of the failure. The windshield had yet to be repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 1,000. The VIN was not available.
WHEN ATTEMPTING TO LEAVE OUR HOME DRIVEWAY ON FRIDAY, APRIL 2ND, 2021 (APPROXIMATELY 4PM LOCAL TIME), THE IGNITION BUTTON FAILED TO START THE CAR. INITIALLY, POWER WAS RUNNING TO THE DASH. I CALLED THE SUBARU EASTSIDE DEALERSHIP IN KIRKLAND, WA WHERE THE CAR WAS PURCHASED. THEY TOLD ME TO CALL ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE, WHICH I DID THE FOLLOWING MORNING. WHEN MY WIFE AND I MOVED OUR CAR SEAT AND BELONGINGS TO THE OTHER CAR IN THE DRIVEWAY, THE REAR LIFT GATE STARTED TO MALFUNCTION AND WOULD NOT OPEN (RESULTING IN A REPEATED 3 BEEP SOUND), BLOCKING ACCESS TO MY JUMPER CABLES, WHICH WERE IN THE TRUNK. EVENTUALLY, THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM STOPPED RESPONDING ALL TOGETHER.  WHEN ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE (SENT OUT BY SUBARU ROADSIDE) EVENTUALLY SHOWED UP THE FOLLOWING MORNING, A JUMP START BY THE TECHNICIAN STARTED THE VEHICLE.
A SMALL, APPROXIMATELY 3" CRACK APPEARED ON LOWER DRIVER SIDE OF WINDSHIELD WITH NO APPARENT IMPACT AT THAT TIME. VEHICLE WAS PARKED AND THE CRACKED WAS NOTICED IN THE EVENING. CONTACTED SUBARU WHO DIRECTED TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO A DEALER FOR EVALUATION. WHILE WAITING FOR EVALUATION (SEVERAL WEEKS), THE CRACK CONTINUED TO GROW TO APPROXIMATELY 18". SUBARU DETERMINED AN IMPACT CAUSED THE CRACK, THOUGH THE ONLY POSSIBLE IMPACT SITE WAS APPROXIMATELY 1/16" IN DIAMETER. VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED ONE MONTH PRIOR.
I CAME OUT TO THE CAR AND THERE IS A LARGE FOOT LONG PLUS CRACK FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE WINDSHIELD UP ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. IT DEVELOPED OUT OF NOWHERE.
PURCHASED A NEW SUBARU FORESTER SPORT MAY 25 2020, THE MORNING OF 1/22/2020 WE WOKE UP TO A CRACK IN THE WINDSHIELD FROM PASSENGER SIDE ALL THE WAY TO THE MIDDLE OF THE GLASS. THE VEHICLE IS GARAGE KEPT AND VERY WELL TAKEN CARE OF. THE WEATHER WAS CERTAINLY NOT AN ISSUE AS IT DOES NOT GET BELOW FREEZING OFTEN (ESPCIALLY IN OUR GARAGE) IN THE SOUTHEAST THIS TIME OF YEAR. I WALKED OUT TO START THE CAR TO LET IT WARM UP BEFORE DRIVING AS I ALWAYS DO, WALKED BACK INSIDE FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES THEN WALK OUT TO FIND A HUGE CRACK ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD. I DONT USE THE DEFROST OR HEAT, JUST THE HEATED SEATS, SO GLASS HEATING UP TO FAST COULDNT HAVE BEEN THE ISSUE; NOT THAT IT SHOULD BE AN ISSUE. HOWEVER I DID NOTICE A SMALL PIN PRICK OF A CHIP IN THE GLASS UPON FURTHER INSPECTION. THAT SAID, THIS GLASS IS FAR TOO FRAGILE AND IM ALREADY EXPECTING TO BE REPLACING IT AGAIN AS THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH SUBARU FOR A FEW YEARS NOW. $1500 TO REPLACE THE GLASS AND RE CALIBRATE EYESIGHT. EXPECTING INSURANCE PREMIUMS TO GO UP AT SOME POINT. THIS GLASS IS BEYOND DEFECTIVE, WEAK, AND WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN SOMETHING SLIGHTLY BIGGER HITS IT? I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING ONE OF THE SAFEST CARS ON THE MARKET...
MY VEHICLE WAS PARKED AT MY PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT, I EXITING MY WORK AND GOT IN THE VEHICLE AND NOTICED A CHIP IN THE WINDSHIELD THAT WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY THERE. I DROVE STRAIGHT HOME, AFTER PARKING IN THE GARAGE THE WINDSHIELD THEN BEGAN TO CRACK AND SPIDER OUT
THE CAR WAS PARKED AS I WAS WALKING UP TO IT THERE WAS A CRACK IN MY WINDSHIELD. I WAS WALKING TO MY CAR AND NOTICED A GLARE WALKING UP AND LOOKED CLOSER AND THERE WAS A CRACKING MY WINDSHIELD
TL* THE CONTACT OWNS A 2020 SUBARU FORESTER. THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE WINDSHIELD WAS CRACKED WITH IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS OF PURCHASING THE VEHICLE AND THAT THE CRACK EXTENDED THROUGHOUT THE LENGTH OF THE WINDSHIELD. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO BOB ROHRMAN SUBARU (1600 S CREASY LN, LAFAYETTE, IN 47905) AND WAS INFORMED BY THE DEALER TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO SAFELITE AUTO GLASS. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO SAFELITE AUTO GLASS AND WAS TEMPORARILY REPAIRED. THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED THAT THE FIX WAS NOT PERMANENT AND THAT THE CRACK COULD SPREAD. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE AND REFERRED THE CONTACT TO NHTSA. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 7,900. *LN*JB*DT*JB
I WAS DRIVING ON A CITY STREET IN TOWN TODAY, 8/3/2020 WHEN MY WINDSHIELD CRACKED FOR NO APPARENT REASON. I WAS GOING 35MPH. IT CRACKED ON THE DRIVERS SIDE TO THE MIDDLE OF THE WINDSHIELD IN THE CENTER.  I CALLED SUBARU IMMEDIATELY AND WAS INFORMED THAT WINDSHIELDS ARE NOT WARRANTIED. THE CAR WAS PURCHASED IN MARCH 2020. I WAS GIVEN WINDSHIELD REPAIR COMPANIES BY THE LOCAL SUBARU DEALER. I REACHED OUT TO ONE COMPANY AND IM WAITING FOR THEM TO SCHEDULE A TIME AND DATE TO REPLACE MY WINDSHIELD. MY VEHICLE IS DIFFICULT TO DRIVE SINCE THE CRACK IS DIRECTLY IN THE CENTER OF THE WINDSHIELD DIRECTLY AT EYE LEVEL.
MY WINDSHIELD CRACKED ALL THE WAY ACROSS WHILE STATIONARY, PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY. I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS HAPPEN BEFORE IN ANY CAR I'VE EVER OWNED. I NEEDED TO CALL MY INSURANCE TO REPLACE THE WINDSHIELD BECAUSE OF THIS DEFECT.  *TR
WALKED OUT TO GARAGE THIS MORNING, AND NOTICED THE WINDSHIELD IS CRACKED.   I AM NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING HITTING THE WINDSHIELD, AND THE CAR HAS LESS THAN 3,000 MILES ON IT, PURCHASED IN FEBRUARY 2020.
OWNED NEW CAR LESS THAN A MONTH AND PASSANGER NOTICED CRACK ORIGINATING NEAR BOTTOM OF GLASS MIDDLE PASSANGER RIGHT SIDE WINDSHIELD. THE CRACK GREW TO 8 INCHES THAT DAY.  I HAVE NO RECOLLECTION OF A STONE OR OBJECT HITTING AND THE LOCATION SEEMS   UNLIKELY PLACE.
WE VERY RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS 2020 FORESTER....LESS THAN 1000 MILES. THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY AND WHEN WE GOT IN IT THE NEXT MORNING THE WINDSHIELD HAD A SMALL CRACK IN IT! I HOPE THIS ISN'T A SIGN OF THINGS TO COME, ESPECIALLY AFTER READING THE POSTS ON HERE OF 2019 FORESTERS WITH WINDSHIELD PROBLEMS. I TOOK IT STRAIGHT TO A WINDSHIELD REPAIR COMPANY AND HAD IT REPAIRED BEFORE THE CRACK GOT WORSE.
The automatic shutoff that occurs when the vehicle stops to prevent idling, disengaged two separate times in the span of 4 days. Both incidents occurred at very busy intersections and failed to restart both times. When attempting to restart the car,  lights came up on the dash, along with beeping, and failed to restart the car after the light had turned green. To restart, the car had to be completely turned off for about 60 seconds and then could be restarted. To avoid having to experience this issue again, or worse - get into an accident - I took it to the shop where they could not recreate the issue.
I’ve owned the vehicle under a year and am already on my second window replacement. I drive the same route everyday and ever experienced windows cracking in any other vehicle before this vehicle.
The contact owns a 2021 Subaru Forester. The contact stated while driving 10 MPH, the vehicle became inoperable. The vehicle stopped independently and failed to respond to the brake or accelerator pedal being depressed. The vehicle was turned off and restarted and returned to normal functionality. The contact stated that the Eyesight detection warning light was illuminated. The vehicle was diagnosed but the cause of the failure was not determined. The vehicle had not been repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure and advised the contact to bring the vehicle in for an extended time. The failure mileage was approximately 34,000.
I was driving in downtown Chicago with my cousin. We had already been in the car driving around the city for ~15 minutes, so the car was warm. I had approached a stoplight, and we both heard a thud. I had assumed, because it had recently snowed, that it was some slush dropping on my car from a light. So, we were both looking around (specifically up), for what it could be. However, when we both looked forward again, we saw a 6-inch crack in my windshield. It's in the middle of my windshield in between my two wipers. As I further drove, the crack continued to grow for another 4-5 inches to the right. After doing a bit of research, Subaru has had issues with windshields before, and has settled a class action lawsuit (CLA) related to it. The crack that I experienced is the same type of crack that occurred with the windshields in the CLA.   I had reached out to my insurance company (Progressive), and they did not have any idea about this issue with Subarus and said that it was not covered to replace it. I have not reached out to dealership yet for information. There was no warning lights, no drastic speed, no rocks or physical damage to the region that could explain the crack. However, if something like this could occur when barely anything is happening, what is the safety for a windshield when the car is on a highway, when a stone hits, when its sub-zero temperatures, etc.
Windshield crack spontaneously appeared while parked. There are no rock chips. Crack starts where the windshield wipers meet, immediately over the heated windshield wiper location. This is the same issue that Subaru recently had a class action lawsuit against them for, though that was for models up to the year 2020. Subaru so far has denied there to be an issue and states that the warranty period is up to 36,000 miles, which I have surpassed in the 17 months since I bought it brand new in 2021. There appears to be a bubble under the glass where the crack started.
Design flaw-2022 Subaru Forester, Antenna placements inside body of car result in pacemaker interference and make it impossible to drive in and avoid.  Antennas are built into frame of car and cannot be disabled to accommodate for disabled persons who have implantable medical devices.  Inability to be able to permanently and completely disable technology that can interfere with implantable medical devices including "StarLink", GPS, Wireless and Radio wave technologies.  Failure by Subaru to release testing results of above telematic devices to consumers. Failure by auto industry to properly test these systems before implementing into autos.  Failure by auto industry to allow for accomodating people with disabilities to operate and purchase safely autos with these features. I want a black box warning on all vehicle stickers and complete disclosure in writing to dangers and exclusion to disable person to operate these vehicles!   I disclosed to sells staff at Subaru at time of looking at vehicles to purchase that I have pacemaker, no warning was giving or safety concerns for persons with pacemakers.  After purchase of vehicle and experiencing pacemaker function issues caused by these systems I was informed to stay 8" away from all antennas, which is impossible to do while driving or sitting in or near vehicle.  I now have a vehicle I cannot drive and Subaru has refused to buy back to vehicle.  I also want all any any testing info result findings do by NHTSA/Subaru to be mail to me asap!  Thanks for your time.
I purchased this vehicle one week ago and the first four miles I was on the interstate a small rock cracked my windshield. The issues with the Forester windshields extend to the 2021 models.
Cracked windshield while car was parked and nothing hit it. There is a separation in the glass that is not normally seen when caused by debris
I PURCHASED MY 2021 SUBARU FORESTER IN LATE NOVEMBER 2020. ON THE MORNING OF 2/24/2021 I DISCOVERED THAT MY WINDSHIELD HAD A CRACK. I WAS NOT DRIVING.  IT STARTED AT THE BOTTOM CENTER OF THE WINDSHIELD AND WENT UP FROM THERE.  IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN FROM AN IMPACT SINCE THE CRACK STARTED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WINDSHIELD, BELOW THE LINE OF THE HOOD AND BELOW THE WINDSHIELD WIPER.  OVER THE NEXT WEEK THE CRACK GOT LONGER.  MY SUBARU DEALER REPLACED THE WINDSHIELD UNDER WARRANTY.
Check Engine, Eyesight Off, [S] flashing, Check Owners Manual came on meanwhile driving at normal speeds, 55mph, last dealership check and oil change was June 20, 2024. Finding same error has occurred to other Subaru Forester drivers: NHTSA ID # 11490232 NHTSA ID # 12479843 NHTSA ID # 11511658 NHTSA ID # 11490977 NHTSA ID # 11479843 NHTSA ID # 11499756 NHTSA ID # 11480952 NHTSA ID # 11491752 NHTSA ID # 11474804 found on [XXX] . Will take car to Advanced Autoparts in the morning to get a code read. Previously found to be an issue with Thermo Control Valve. I am two hours away from a Subaru dealership. HELP!!!! INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)
The contact owns a 2022 Subaru Forester. The contact stated while attempting to park in her brother's driveway with the brake pedal depressed, the vehicle accelerated unintendedly. There was no warning light illuminated. The contact continued to apply the brakes but the vehicle failed to respond, drove into the garage, and crashed into appliances. The air bags did not deploy. There was no injury sustained. There was no police report filed. The vehicle was later taken to the dealer, where it was diagnosed that no issues were found. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and sent a field technician who diagnosed that no issues were found. The manufacturer did not provide further assistance. The vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 4,000.
Two things have already failed on this vehicle. The first being the seats/seat belt clips on the driver and passanger seat. The seat in constructed in such a way that no matter what adjustment is made, the driver feels as if they are falling into the steering wheel. Any attempts to correct the positioning leaves the driver feeling as if they do not have control of the vehicle. Additionally, the inward positioning of the seat-belt clip on the right side on the driver facing inward pushes into the drivers hip and/or thigh causing extreme pain. The narrowing of the seats does not allow the driver to get away from the pain of the seat belt clip.  Second, the issue with the windshield. This is my second Subaru Forester. On my first, I had a cracked windshield in 5 places due to small debris hitting the vehicle in a normal operating matter. This was replaced. My current vehicle, with less than 500 miles on it, already has 5-6 chips in the windshield due to some defect in the glass that causes the glass crack under nearly no pressure at all. I can't even imagine where the cracks came from with such low mileage and driving in near perfect, normal operating condition. It is only a matter of time before I will need to have the windshield replaced on this vehicle. It is also hazardous to know that it may shatter and injure me at any time. I have had the vehicle less than 5 weeks.
The contact owns a 2022 Subaru Forester. The contact stated while starting the vehicle, she noticed a crack on the windshield which started from the bottom of the front windshield and expanded to the driver's side casing a visibility hazard. The vehicle was taken to the dealer but was not diagnosed. The representative at the dealer took a picture and forwarded the picture to the manufacturer. The windshield was not replaced. The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 7,600.
